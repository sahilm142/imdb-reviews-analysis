 "You wanna play rough?? OKAY!"

 The Real Scarface.

 Grandiose, bloodyminded and implacable

 This is GREAT

 The 80's and how not to live them...

 A Brutal, Uncompromising Masterpiece

 Loved, But For The Wrong Reasons

 Excessive, violent, and distasteful just like the people it's depicting.

 A misunderstood and very unappreciated film

 Great movie my favorite

 Scarface reminds me of....

 De Palma's finest work

 The Greatest Movie Ever

 One of the greatest movies ever made

 Say hello to my little friend !!!
