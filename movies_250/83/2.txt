This is the problem with Hindi movies. Hype to the peak and then when you actually see the movie it's just another ordinary movie. Happens with the movies with these Khans who have very limited acting capability. Dangal is know special. Same theme which you have scene in 50 movies before. Okay direction and lots of exaggeration which you can feel right there. After 1 week the films rating will drop like anything once the fans finish watching it. Dangal's cast is good and you could just watch once it's available for streaming. Going to theaters for this kind of movie is just a waste. 2nd half is slow and boring Coach character not shown right Unnecessary patriotic sentiment Seen several films like this before
