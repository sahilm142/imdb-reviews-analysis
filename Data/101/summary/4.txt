 It`s Not Good

 Implausible,stupid movie- "just because your a genius doesn't mean that you can't be super cool too"

 Sophomoric and over-rated

 Over-rated

 Garbled Nonsense

 Some good touches but overall silly and cringy

 typical mainstream film product

 Great Performance By Damon, But The Movie As A Whole Was A Bit Of A Drag

 Way too many "F" words....

 Ordinary People, anyone?

 I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKED IT

 Ill Will

 Did I miss something?
