 A colorful ode to the Mexican culture and to the family values, but that's kinda it

 Viva Coco! (Despite it's flaws)

 A great watch but it could have been funnier!

 Wow

 Coco is a must see

 Adorable

 A Celebration of a Living Culture for the Dead (Might Be Too Hard an Act To Follow for Pixar)

 This is an enjoyable animated film for younger children

 A visually stunning and emotionally satisfying animation.

 Good movie, but too similar to Book of Life

 Great

 great family movie

 Miguel and Hector's songs are the best

 Predictable Plotline with Beautiful Animation

 Classic Disney Fun

 An Above-Average Film Blown Out of Proportion

 Didn't Connect with "Coco"

 the past will return

 Good, but a little overrated

 Not the best from Pixar.

 Redo of The Book of Life

 recycling plots

 That's it?

 It Was OK !

 A Visual Spectacle with a Warm Message
