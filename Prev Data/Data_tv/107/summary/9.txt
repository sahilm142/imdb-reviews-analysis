 The dawn of a new era. A sci-fi show you don't have to be a nerd to watch.

 Like the old Battlestar better? Buy the box set and shut up about the Re-imagining.

 A great introduction to the new Galactica

 Stargate writers. Take note!!!!

 A poor script from the ghetto makes good.

 Much better than the original

 The Return of the Mini-Series

 Everything Voyager should have been

 I agree!

 Successful creation of silk purse from sow's ear
