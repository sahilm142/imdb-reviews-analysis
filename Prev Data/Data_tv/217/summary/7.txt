 Hearts Of Dirtness and Nothing is Assured

 Howlingly silly, but strangely watchable!

 I have a use for you...

 So much promise...

 TOM HARDY needs to stop POSING and start acting! What a Let Down!

 Slow-paced but awesome acting, dialogues & realistic.

 Intriguing

 Dark and good characters - but a tedious watch

 Seems promising

 Good, but yet to hit top gear

 A period piece passion project
