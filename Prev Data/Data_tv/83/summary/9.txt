 one of the best

 Different but good

 This show makes you a part of it.

 Real lives, and deaths, as never before

 Classic

 Inspiration for life through the dead and buried

 It's Basically Death Porn, but Good Death Porn

 One of the best series ever about family life and life in general in modern times

 Unique show that brought death out of closet

 Six Feet and a Foot, Under

 Brilliant

 It's not a series but real reality show

 brilliant

 Truly brilliant and truly annoying

 Excellent, though maddeningly uneven, domestic drama

 One of the best show's of all time

 Exhausting, Emotionally Draining, but Exhillarating!

 Six Feet Under: Life through Death.

 great family that you root for

 Stuck Between the Earth and Six Feet Under

 It will bring out your deepest of thoughts and leave a mark forever

 Beyond

 Six Feet Under - The Best TV Series I ever watched

 Love the show otherwise...

 How sad this show is over already.
