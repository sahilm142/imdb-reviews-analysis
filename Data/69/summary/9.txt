 ALIENS IS THE SCI-FI GENRE

 Aliens..My all time favourite Sci-Fi movies. It rocks!

 Could Hardly Be Improved.

 In space, no one can hear you scream.

 They Mostly Come Out AT Night. Mostly.

 The ultimate proof that a sequel can be better than the original

 One of cinema's greatest ever sequels

 James Cameron's Aliens is a superb science-fiction experience that improves upon its predecessor

 An amazing sci-fi action spectacle and perfect sequel

 A great action movie that shows us how powerful is the relationship between the child and the parent

 Not better than the first... but

 The best "Alien" so far.

 Violence is needed for survival

 "One of the Best Sequels Ever Made"...

 In the pipe, five by five

 Best movie ever made. Period.

 One of the best action films of the 80s.

 Sheer, unadulterated movie-making magic...A true tour de force...

 A sci-fi action thrill ride!

 Great follow up

 For big-budget, high-octane showmanship, Aliens is hard to beat.

 Certainly a choice sci-fi!

 A sequel that moved me!

 A great sequel to a classic film

 Wonderfully tense sci-fi fantasy
