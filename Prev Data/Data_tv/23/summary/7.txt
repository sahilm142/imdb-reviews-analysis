 Season 1: A Masterpiece ..... Season 2: A Disaster

 Time-Line Head-Spin for 3rd Season

 Excellent first two episodes...Then crashes and burns..

 What's With All The Mumbling?

 There should've never been a second season...

 Great first season, but lacklustre since then

 I feel made a fool of

 Boring, boring, boring

 Ummm

 Two superb acting performances carry an otherwise mediocre series

 The world as veil, overtly hidden self

 Season 2 starts slow, but gets AMAZING

 Not as good as Season 1 or as bad as 2

 Great series betrayed by TV's addiction to a 'happy ending'

 Very good, but not blow-me-away great

 Season 1 is not as perfect as people say it is, Season 2 is not as bad as people say

 Season 2 not at the level of season 1

 Haha love this show!

 Starts Fantastic, Continues Ordinary, Ends terrible !

 Over-sophisticated and slow, with great performances though

 2 seasons, 2 different shows

 Standing by my view of this as student work

 Will they ever reach the greatness of season 1 ever again ?

 Good but not perfect - a bit hard to follow.
