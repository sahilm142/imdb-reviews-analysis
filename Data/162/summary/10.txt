 It's all in the ending

 Loved It

 I see dead people...walking around like regular people.

 A Masterpiece

 They should give Bruce Willis an Oscar

 Amazing, even when you re-watch

 I See Dead People(****Out Of ****)

 Best twist since The Usual Suspects

 The Sixth Sense phenomenon.

 An original new kind of horror movie.

 The Way Cinema Is Supposed To Work

 Absolutely brilliant

 A Classic

 You're Nice...But You Can't Help Me...

 Great film.

 a modern psychological suspense masterpiece

 I See Dead People

 a thriller in the real sense of the word

 I didn't get until the Dr. got it

 It's not about the scares, or the "surprise" ending...
