 Gayus Maximus

 Terrible!

 AWFUL! Simply AWFUL!!! Stick with 1960 version with Kirk Douglas & Laurence Olivier

 gratuitous trash

 Blood and Sand and no Story!

 I do not know were to start...

 Blood and Tits

 Andy Died, but Writers Killed Show

 Separate Paths

 As bad as bad can be

 Complete Nonsense. Childish CGI, Riddled with Clichés

 First season was great...2nd & 3rd not so...Disappointed.

 Sh*t sells!

 Sex, violence and special effects, a recipe for morons to sit in front of the TV.

 Sex and violence ad nauseam

 Bad ideas, bad plot smoothness, bad filming and awful actors.

 One of the WORST SHOWS EVER!

 It's an obscene gore fest.

 Stopped watching it after about 15 mins..

 Marxist propaganda

 Cringe worthy

 too much shakycam for me...

 Romans using the F-word, really?!!

 It went too far...
