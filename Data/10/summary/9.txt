 Almost Perfect movie

 Thought Provoking Content

 An instant cult classic!

 Classic Thriller

 In a year of amazing films, this one always stands out for me.

 Fascinating piece

 Not as provocative as it thinks, but still a hit

 Rule number one about Fight Club; you do not talk about Fight Club. Rule number two about Fight Club: you do not talk about Fight Club!
