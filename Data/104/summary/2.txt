 The Worst Movie of 2000?

 "Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels" Revisited

 Funny, but not funny enough to illegitimize its violence.

 Lot of characters not much interest

 are you joking?

 'Lock Stock...' but 20 times more annoying

 Not even brad pitt could save it

 They spent how many millions on this?

 Not since 'Crime Story' has Farina had a role that is his equal!
