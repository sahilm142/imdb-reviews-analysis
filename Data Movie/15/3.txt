***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Since I have read the books once, my review will of course be weighted somewhat by that.First, let me try to see the movie as a new film, no preferences, just another movie. It is nearly 3 hours long, a format very hard to master. You have to keep the viewer interested at all time not to let him/her fall asleep. This is mainly done by effects in this movie, which I think is not enough. The plot does not contain the sufficient amount of suspense, nor does the music. The plot vanishes in monumental 20 minutes scenes just saying: "There was a fight" or "He is the bad guy". Scenes like that are just there to restate something that was even too obvious the first time it was shown. Accompanied by an equally monumental musical score this constant insulting of your intelligence just makes your mind go numb. Peter Jackson could have said all this movie says in one hour instead of three, if he was a good director. A film is only as good as it's story.Some things are of course good. The casting is great (with some exceptions), the acting is as good as one can expect, the scenery is good (OK, the barren waste since a thousand years is a lush forest, but who cares? I don't) and the special effects are marvelous and incredible. Sadly, that's all there is to it. I really wanted this trilogy to be the best, the greatest films ever created. I hoped that the second part would be better than the far from perfect first movie, but I got brutally let down. Beneath the crust of pure eye candy this is a hollow void.The conclusion is: Go see this movie, but don't expect anything but a nice computer demo. The animators deserve the credits, the "director" should be ashamed.Corrolary: Since Peter Jackson has written his own plot I would like to state some of the major differences. People saying that the books are just good vs. evil have probably never read them.Warning, some plot spoiling ahead!!! (I think someone else already spoiled it, but ok)An example of polarization of good-evil: The ambitious fellow Saruman believes he can beat Sauron and thus save Middleearth if he gets hold of the one ring (and he probably could). He is not evil, he has his own way of seeing things.This is reduced to him being the all evil lackey of the all evil Sauron.An example of how the importance of CHANCE is ripped away:Pippin (I think) by curiosity uses the palantir when it is by chance aimed at Mordor and sees Sauron who ask: "Who are you?" Pippin answers: "A hobbit" before he is interrupted by his friends. This event leads Sauron to the (erroneous) conclusion that Saruman has the ring. Why? Since it is very painful to use the palantir, none of the good guys would do it to a hobbit, ergo Saruman made him do it. Ergo, Saruman wants to show Sauron that he has the hobbit i. e. the ringbearer and the ring. Sauron thinks Saruman has the ring and acts according to that, which is the only reason he empties Mordor of troops. If the alliance has the ring an attack is possible. Aragorn is also using the palantir in a somewhat taunting way to enhance this. In doing this Sauron opened the only possibility for Frodo and Sam to reach mt. Doom without getting caught by patrols. When he realize that the ring is in Mordor, it is too late. All this due to a little hobbits curiosity, a factor Sauron didn't and couldn't take into account.In the films this simply isn't. Everything is deterministic. Everything is planned and thought of, thus actually making it impossible for Sauron to lose.More examples could easily be stated. However, I only considered things that are greatly contradictory to the spirit of the books, not actual plot misses which are numerous./The disappointed storyliner
comparing to the fellowship, ttt is just trash. there are no characters, no real emotion, and it goes from one thing to the next without a logical order or meaning. i really hope the third part will be more like the first. i really really hope the end will be the same as in the book, and not a possible kiss between aragorn and his elf-lover... ugh...


                
After falling asleep watching The Fellowship I decided to give the two towers a chance.It sadly is more of the same unimaginative black and white world depiction like the Fellowship. There are only 2 kinds of people, the good guys and the bad guys in the Lord of the rings movies.The good guys look nice, fresh, heroic and smart. The bad guys have hideous faces, wear old clothes, are conniving and not too bright. In the two towers Frodo continues his way to Mordor to destroy the ring. This time accompanied and guided by Gollum, some CGI created creature. Again they walk an awful lot and encounter some danger which they narrowly manage to avoid. At the end of the movie though, they still haven't managed to make it so well need a 3rd movie to find out if Frodo will succeed. I have a strange feeling that he just might.The 2 captured Hobbits escape and seek refuge in a walking tree. I've been told they spend 58 hours per frame to make it look real. To me it looked straight out of Sesamestreet and i had trouble not to laugh.Suddenly Gandalf appears out of nowhere and wasn't killed after all in his demon battling in film number 1. Ahh, what a shame. You really cant believe anything in this movie. After some bickering in the land of horsemen we see a huge battle between the (300) good guys and the (10000) bad guys. Off course, the good guys win. How surprising. By then I finally dozed off into a deep sleep whilst knowing this is a perfect film for children aged 3 to 10. It wasn't as bad as The Fellowship but it was still waaaaaaaaaaaaay too predictable and simplistic. I didn't give it a 1 but a 3 because I did like the cinematography and the locations where nicely chosen.
Review applies to both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers are visually impressive films having wonderful sets, costumes and make-up.  The computer-generated effects are generally effective and occasionally wonderful, even awe-inspiring. However both films are boring.  The vivid and well-realised images on the screen are not sufficient compensation for the very poor story-telling.Director Peter Jackson can justly take credit for the feat of organising and being responsible for an apparently huge undertaking in getting support for three ambitious, expensive films and then making them on an apparently epic scale.  The art direction is wonderful and he has gathered some great teams about him that convincingly bring Tolkien's Middle-Earth to the cinema. Not least, it must be a feat to be entrusted with millions of dollars and keep all those film executives at bay whilst one gets on with the job.That said, the storytelling is inept.  Jackson shares the writing credits with two others and they take great liberties with Tolkien's story. This might have been all right if they had made the story better or more suitable for the medium of film, but the changes are not very good and they are badly handled.  The screenplay also misses much of the wit and interest of Tolkien's work.  It also lacks the drama and tension.Even when considered as a film independent of Tolkien's tale, the story-telling is very poor.  This is a director who relies on vivid imagery and hasn't much of an idea as to what makes a decent script.  Many of the exchanges between characters are extremely limited; there is nothing deep or profound.  Every now and again some of Tolkien's dialogue appears (easy to spot because they're the good bits) but Jackson and Co. appear to have cut and pasted such sections into their script without much care as to whether it comfortably fits into the stuff they have written.Perhaps it is no accident therefore that the film has not attracted true film stars to play the major roles.  This is a B-movie cast to go with a B-movie script.  That's not to say that some of the actors aren't good: Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Sean Bean give good performances, but one suspects that with a decent script the film series would have been attractive to star actors to take the lead roles.  Sometimes the casting of virtually unknown actors can pay off but I'm afraid that they aren't really given much to work on and thus little chance to show what they can do.I don't think that Peter Jackson's direction helps his actors much.  This is not a director with a great range, and things such as subtlety lie outside it.  Nor do I think he rates the intelligence and comprehension of the audience very highly.  Everything is thrust into the viewer's face. Nothing lurks menacingly just out of sight, nothing is merely glimpsed or suspected, no tension is built up: bad things or monsters just appear - "bam!".  Slow motion, backlighting (at night and in the wilderness) and extreme close-ups are laid on thickly.  The lighting is artificial and the editing is very careless and disjointed.(This is an occasion where the medium of DVD may really be useful.  The good thing about DVD is that people will be able to choose the sections they wish to watch and will thus be able to oogle over the wonderful set-pieces as often as they like without having to suffer the tedious parts.)I shouldn't really be bothered going on about all this as it's just a film, but I think that undeserved kudos and plaudits are being heaped on Peter Jackson (not to mention tons of money).  What is more, studios will may be further encouraged to think that a decent script is unimportant for a good film.The fact that quite a number of people rave about this film means that the money and effort used to make it were not entirely wasted.  (I suspect that they were so impressed by the imagery and the grand theme that they have been able to overlook the films' serious shortcomings.)  The sad thing is that a first-rate production was let down by a bad script and clumsy direction.  It deserved better.


                
I love J.R.R.Tolkien. I've read the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit...hmmm...at least 100 times. Honestly. From the time I was 7 years old, these have been my favorite books. And all his other writings. Heck, I even speak three dialects of Elvish and can write in dwarf runes and the runes of Daeron.... I'm a big Tolkien geek.And I understand that these books are impossible to adapt completely to film. But c'mon! Make an effort! These are beautifully shot, though filled with lots of CGI (which I detest). Beautiful scenery, able direction and OK acting. You would think I could give it at least 5 stars. I can't, and here's why: Don't make stuff up. Really. Whoever wrote this screen play is a servant of Sauron. What's with all the invention? It's a fantasy FILLED with fabulous work. Tolkien was a master storyteller. This screenwriter (unless there were several, in which case much is made clear. Nothing good ever comes from committee) really needed to leave well enough alone.


                
I loved the Fellowship of the Ring and was greatly anticipating this film. This film however did not have nearly the same wow effect as the first movie. Effects in this movie are defenitly top notch and it makes the movie worth seeing just for the huge scale of the battles but other than that I thought this movie had far less substance. The best part of the movie is Golem, he is spectacular and who can't love him? Unfortunately he was the only character in this movie I found myself caring about. About all you get from Gimliy and Legalos are a BOMBARDMENT of simply awful jokes. Going alongside the wall at helms deep WAS humorous when you come by Gimliy not being able to see over the wall, yet like all the good humor in this movie they immediately destroy the joke by over doing it, "Shall I fetch you a box." No thanks Mr. Elf I would prefer a mute button. Going back to Gimliy again, I found it very annoying that Treebeard's voice was done by the same actor, this however wont bother most of you... hopefully. The battles for the most part are epic and truelly spectacular, yet they throw in many scenes that make me cringe and want to look away, also in this movie I had trouble believing in "the reality of the movie". Examples include... - Legolas was taking out the Orcs and there ride (large beast creatures) with one arrow a piece... they were moving... really fast, This I am fine with but when he get's off two shots at the Orc with the torch resembling a character from The Road Warrior and doesn't put him down... something is wrong. This is also the same character that said when the Orcs were a rather far distance from Helmsdeep to aim for there Necks and Underarms. This brings me to my next and biggest complaint with our elf friend. - Legalos told them to shoot at the Necks etc. because that is where there armor is the weakest. Well there armor does absolutely nothing against shields tossed with feet. The scene that I am talking about where Legolas slides down the stairs is so awfull I don't want to see the movie again if I have to watch that. I was fine with all of legolas' other little tricks but this is completely stupid. It truelly takes away a lot of the serious atmosphere this battle had and turned it into trash. These people are defending there families and I can't take that seriously when I have elf man sliding away. - The central Characters are far to powerfull in this movie. When Aragorn and Gimliy can cover the bridge swarming with orcs by themselves something 30 some people couldn't do it's hard to accept -When the men who capture Frodo and Sam kill the back half of that large army of men, why did the front half completely ignore what was going on? -And finally... there is no was I can believe that not a single person wasn't able to spot either Sam or Frodo when they were at the Gates of Mordor. There little cloaks were not enough to have shielded them from sight and sound with how much running around they did around there.I suggest when you see this movie you simply accept all of its oddness and not "nitpick" like me. I do think the movie is GOOD but it is far from great and IMHO not worthy of a Best Picture nomination.


                
Everybody talks about The Two Towers (TTT) and I must agree that this is one of the top movies this year. But... I regret to say that I am pretty disappointed. Why? In TTT, compared to the Fellowship, there is more action, the story is faster, but... Forgive me but this movie is simply more "american" than the first part. There is a lot of computer graphics, a lot of characters, a lot of... everything. It is pitty that all this stuff draws attention away from the point. I encourage everyone to read the book (and to think about it not just "eat" everything they serve you).


                
As far as I'm concerned I could have just seen the last 20 min of this movie. Nothing happens for almost 2 and half hours. I have not read the books, but I dont think it mattered. This movie was sooo boring that I almost fell asleep and I love movies. The movie stayed on the same topic for way too long. I mean .. I dont understand at all why watching hobbits walk around for 3 hours is exciting .. or a rollercoaster ride.. or even a bit interesting. Some of the special effects were good.. I must say .. but if thats all that was good about the movie .. then it sucks. I could have cared less if any of the main characters died. I expected sooo much more out of this movie. I would suggest seeing any of the movies of Narnia over the Two Towers any day.


                
This movie was a grandiose waste of time. Beautifully filmed, boring as hell. I agree that it's based on a fabulous story. But the book was reekingly badly written and dragging. Couldn't they have condensed the boringness into two hours instead of three excruciating ones? I could forgive it if it were shorter because the last hour was exciting. However, the first two hours were so dull that I looked at my watch every ten minutes. By the time the film really started, I was too disgruntled to care. Feh.


                
If I had to name the most overrated movie, this would be it. While it features some nice eye candy, it falls totally short in the plot.I can imagine that this movie may have some interest, if you have read the book. You may recognize bits and pieces you remember and have some fun comparing the visualizations with the way you imagined things. And as in the first part, some of the scenery is breathtaking. But aside from that, the movie is simply boring and confusing.It's boring because it lacks a coherent, compelling story. In a nutshell, this movie is about a bunch of people wandering around rather aimlessly. To disguise the simplicity of that 'story', many names of people, places and things are thrown at you constantly. As a consequence, I was rather annoyed than entertained.It's no use arguing about taste, but I cannot begin to understand why this mess is considered by so many to be one of the best movies of all time.


                
This movie presented me with a dilemma. I read and loved the book, and I sure did like the first one. I realize that to make a movie you can앖 just follow the book (that would take at least a 20 hour movie) but why waste time in details shown in the book while discarding some important effects the book causes? For example, Frodo압 journey becomes unbearable in the book, here it only seems like a long walk, only uncomfortable. And the story, honestly, becomes to slow and long for a movie. It압 ok for the book to be slow because it gives us time to enjoy the details of Tolkien압 work, but in the movie is just a waste of time. Besides all it압 downsides, it has most of what people should expect: Absolutely AMAZING special effects, Gollum is as real as it gets and the battle scene it압 marvellous, but it comes too late. My girlfriend didn앖 read the book and thought the movie was allright, not as surprising as the first one, but good. So, to sum it up, for me it can barely make it. It has a 10 in special effects, but a 2 in the plot.


                
As someone read the book, I found the film version pretty disappointing. The film maker made a number of deviations from the book, and it is not obvious why. Does Peter Jackson think he is a better story teller than Tolkein? I don't think so. He made plot changes, like having Theoden actually possessed by Saruman (!) and having Frodo actually offer the ring to the Ringwraith (!). Why? He also developed characters differently, which was sort of annoying. All of a sudden, Treebeard was a menacing zombie, Faramir was mean-spirited, and Gimli was comical. Again, why? I thought Jackson did a much better job with the "Fellowship of the Ring." Here he took way too much license. And he puts so much focus into the battle scenes that that the actually story gets kind of lost. Thumbs down!


                
'The Fellowship of the Ring' was a decent movie that has been overblown completely out of proportion by fans of the books. And I did like it but it's not one of the top movies ever. 'The Two Towers' on the other hand is an overly long and boring film that has nearly ruined my desire to finish the series and pursue the books.This film has so many problems it might not be possible to fit them all here but I will try. The biggest issue is that Peter Jackson, his fellow screenwriters and his editor have gotten way ahead of themselves and have crafted themselves a book on film that moves elliptically and slowly at that. This film screams 'Slave to the Book and I haven't even read it.' The editing problems is what contributes most to the problems of pace in this film we get unnecessary fantasies of the future both of Arwen's and Aragon's. The film amidst is big action sequences is too talky Galadriel gives a huge speech so does Samwise and so much of it is unnecessary. This is where I point to the screenwriters and the editor (for allowing all these pointless traveling shots)."Is this a film? Or a play or a book?" because there's too much talking and too much story and so little of it is interesting.Gollum is another huge problem. When he's not incomprehensible he's annoying. Why should I care at all that he has some form of Middle-Earth Schizophrenia? And all he does is further point out that Frodo is the most flawed character for being too trusting and also leads us to notice that Frodo is the only one constantly in conflict yet he's missing 85% of the time, after the first act and Gandalf is the only one who makes the movie worth watching and he's missing 95% of the time. The rotation of the characters in their own scenes becomes predictable and another hindrance. The Battle at Helm's Deep is interrupted 4 times by the stupid walking tree scenes (If the trees can walk and fight how some get chopped down?). What I found more often than not is that I saw many concepts that I've seen in other fantasy films. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the Bible of fantasy literature but the other films paying homage to it have been far and away better. The score of this film was also overrated in the first film and in this one Howard Shore was trying to make every single moment in the film the most important and most memorable and it never worked. His quasi-Irish quasi-classical score did nothing but bore me to tears. Not only was there a lack of filmic sensibility on the part of the makers of this film but there were story problems like when Gandalf revives the King what is that shot of Saruman falling all about.The actors do their best in this film besides Elijah Wood who seems to be wasting his time playing such a paper-thin character. Viggo Mortensen has my sympathies but not even the likes of Christopher Lee and Ian McKellan could stop this train wreck. 3/10.

Like the first film, there's not much to recommend this film unless you're willing to overlook the terrible CG, lackluster script, maudlin direction, and generally bad acting.Peter Jackson proves that he's not much of a director, simply resorting to slow motion to remind us that something terrible is about to happen (which is generally obvious in the juvenile script), while Howard Shore does the same with the music (if I had to hear the "ethereal" singing one more time during a battle scene, I might have been driven to insanity).In spite of what people are claiming about Golum, he's no more convincing than the pixies in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Worst of all dor a sequel, no recap is done for anyone who hadn't seen the first film. So in most theatres, you're bound to be sitting near a group of people who dragged a friend to this and have to explain what's going on throughout the film (eg. the show we saw had someone trying to explain why Frodo is important to the story even though his character has virtually nothing to do with the events depicted in Two Towers.)I might only have given this film a 2, but for the fact that the scenes with the Ents were actually reasonably done.Summary: For fans of Tolkien only.


                
The second installment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien'strilogy loses none of the epic feel or the original, and adds aconsiderable amount of action/adventure to fill out the bill.One can admire the first-rate special effects and certain aspects ofthe visual design. A new character, one of the most realisticanimatronic creatures yet conceived, almost steals the show. Buteven in spite of all this, The Two Towers comes off as a bitbloated, repetitive, and even occasionally dull..The characters aren't particularly interesting. Ian McKellan as theWhite Wizard is again the standout performance; most everyoneelse lacks star quality. In particular, Liv Tyler speaks as if she's ina trance. Ironically, the most fascinating characters here arecomputer-generated: the talking trees, and a misshapen creaturewho once owned the Ring.Most of the film is painted in broad strokes, at once giving it amythic sense while making it feel too simple. The characters moveback and forth between being captured and released with very littleemotional payoff. The occasional humor boils down to charactersfalling falling on their faces. Worst of all, the film's dialog is completely generic, devoid ofcrackle and originality. No Oscar nominations for script this year.I was sitting next to some Ring fans on opening day. As theclosing theme came up and people began to leave, one of themsaid, "Gee. That was a disappointment." His pal nodded.


                
I'll start with the best: the portrayal of Gollum and his interaction with Frodo and Sam was brilliant: better than the book! I'm still trying to figure out just what the Aragorn/Warg/Brego the wonder horse scene was suppose to contribute: it added no tension, nothing to the plot (other than asking us to believe Aragorn's horse, who now sports someone else's name, could wander down from the north and find Aragorn in his hour of need -- we might as well have been watching Free Willy), no excitement, and no character development. And then there was Farmir, who in the movie was nothing more than a pale shadow of Boromir. And again, for what purpose? And then the major plot hole, for which the bastardization of Farmir was apparently done to set up, where Frodo shows the one ring to the ringwraith, who then flies away because someone shot an arrow at it. Even if we are to swallow this lump of cinematic lard, there's now a little problem of Sauron now knowing WHO has the ring and WHERE it is, which is going to take some significant stretching of the plot to cover over in the Return of the King. The Fellowship of the Ring is one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately the Two Towers is a massive disappointment.


                
I really did like "The two Towers". However, I can't help wondering how amazing that movie could have been, if Peter Jackson hadn't had the chance to alter it after the huge fuss everyone made about "The Fellowship".I guess there have been a lot of changes. Gimli for example is joking throughout the whole movie. Even in the most serious moments, he doesn't seem to realize, that his life is in danger. I guess Jackson noticed, that dwarf-jokes work well on the audience - so why not expand that to 'a-joke-a-minute'? But that's not the worst thing about "Two Towers".I totally loved the first part of the movie. Everything was just great. Gollum was superb, the whole movie was splendid. But then, it started going wrong. Why did Aragorn have to fall off that cliff? Why did Jackson have to include Elrond and Galadriel again? In a really stupid scene, anyway. I didn't mind Aragorn's phantasizing about Arwen though. I think that was nice.But why in the world did Jackson make Faramir such a bad character? He doesn't take Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath in the book, why should he in the movie? He supports them in the book and is a purely good character. That whole Osgiliath scene was just totally annoying.The same goes for the Ents. I was afraid that they would look stupid - but they didn't. They looked great. They were just like Tolkien described them in the book. But why did they have to refuse fighting at first after a long period of thinking. And then, when they see Isengard, they decide in two seconds to attack - Treebeard just has to shout and out they all jump. 'Cause they're so fast... Yeah, sure!The Helm's Deep fighting was good, but what on earth was Haldir doing there? Just included to have another hero dying, I suppose. And the counting thing between Legolas and Gimli is included and then again not really, because it ends just after it began. No caves to discover for Gimli either.I know of course that you can't include everything in one movie, but there was some 'additional' crap in "The Two Towers" (meaning that it was not in the book) that could have been left out and a lot of original scenes that were left out.Don't get me wrong: "The two Towers" was a great movie. But it's not as good as "The Fellowship". I wish I could see the original version, before Peter Jackson changed it...


                
The best thing about this movie is Gollum. Gollum has always been my favorite character in the books, and they did an amazing job with him. The movie itself is bla. I don't mind that it doesn't stand on its own as a movie (it is a series and the director shouldn't have to waste time reviewing), so I thought it was good to just jump into it. But it never quite jumps. It kind of skips, and then you have this feeling that it is about to fall. It adds things that aren't necessary (Arwen and Galadriel), and subtracts things that are important (Deagle). It expands the battle of Helm's Deep into this huge thing, what Peter Jackson doesn't realize is that Battles are so boring. Wow more Orcs attacking! The only time when battles are interesting is when you feel for BOTH sides, and I'm sorry you can't feel for the orcs (now this is not Peter Jackson's fault but it is his fault to think that what the story needs is more battles). Also I can't believe he actually put a bomb in it.The battles are my main problem but also he destroyed Faramir's character, making him just like Boromir, and I must admit to being in love with Faramir in the book so I was just a little upset about that. Where the movie really shot itself in the leg though is the ending (don't worry I won't tell you what happens). The end of the book is one of the most suspenceful moments in the book, I actually started The Return of the King at Book II to find out what happened to Frodo and Sam. Well the end of the movie is completely different from the book just ending the movie on a low note.Eiowyn was cool and just how I imagined her though, so I'm happy about that.So you all probably hate me now for giving it a 3 star rating, but you guys are entitled to like it if you want (just not more than the original Star Wars Trilogy which I think is heavily based on Tolkien and actually is a better transfering of the books onto film).


                
I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition.  Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director.  I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion.  Some of the deviations were  so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother?  Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).)  I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book.  However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie.  My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said "did they go there in the book?", and my answer was "no, and it is wrecking the movie!".  After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected.  I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie.  I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation.  I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters.  (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )


                
I just finished watching the Two Towers and i have to admit, it was no where near as good as the first one. I felt it was too long and really didn't advance the plot any. Some of the scenes were amazing and the work with Golumn (sp?) was superb. But overall, not all that good.


                
***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** A few disclaimers:First, I have enormous respect for the effect of Tolkien's work despite the fact that, to be honest, his writing style doesn't do much for me.Second, I loved the first movie. It really brought the book to life for me. The changes PJ made were forgivable because, like having Arwen save Frodo in order to get Liv Tyler more screentime, they didn't particularly alter the plot or the nature of the characters.Third, I was annoyed with people who slammed the first movie for whatever little quibble they could come up with. I wanted these movies to be great and get no satisfaction out of reporting otherwise.No, with this second installment it seems that Jackson and co have decided to throw Tolkien's book out the window in favor of their own screenwriters in far more meaningful ways. In interviews, Peter Jackson has even acknowledged that he thought the books were too "dense" and that they needed to be "simplified" for the average person who was unfamiliar with the books. The best part is that in the same interview, his justification for all this is that "there is a lot of money at stake here".Well, the really sad part is that it didn't even work. During the beginning of the movie, I was trying to watch it as someone who had never read the book (which was not so difficult as it had been some time since I had) and was already disappointed. Characters are introduced too quickly, plotlines are rushed... and the changes this time around are far from trivial.
-- SPOILERS BELOW --Of my wife and I's three favorite characters, only Eowyn, who is actually played quite well, is spared. Poor Gimli has been reduced to comic relief and does little more than fall off horses, be the subject of height jokes and axe people in the groin (yes, the film actually sinks this low). But Faramir fares worst. Apparently the average, non-tolkien-reading person off the street can't grapple with a concept as complex as a man who shows the wisdom to, unlike his brother, see the ring for what it is and not try to take it. No, in this version we are given the 'simplified' Faramir, who does try to take the ring and deliver it to his father as a gift. It takes a close call with a Nazgul (which also never appears in the book) and Samwise spelling it out to him for the 'simplified' Faramir to actually let the ringbearer go. Simplified, or just plain simpleton? The worst part is that this change does absolutely NOTHING for the plot! Sam and Frodo still end up parting ways with Faramir and his men and Faramir is still on his way to defend Gondor. The only difference is that anyone who has read the book and loved the character of Faramir is now disgusted with what we've been given instead.I said that was the worst part. Actually, I lied. The worst part is that there are numerous scenes like this. A completely new, ill-contrived subplot involving Aragorn and Arwen wastes time by doing nothing but giving still more screentime (now in a story that the character isn't even meant to appear in) to a Mabeline-laden Liv Tyler and then taking us back to exactly where we started (unless PJ ends up messing with the characters in even more tasteless ways in the next film). The 'simplified' ents, rather than noticing that a huge chunk of their forrest has been hewn down, initially refuse to take part and have to be manipulated by Pippin into going to Isengard before doing anything. All of these changes seem inferior to the book version and yet they all deposit their characters in roughly the same position as their counterparts in the book. It makes one wonder what PJ was thinking in making the changes at all.I feel betrayed and alienated by this movie. It would have been much better if the first film had been lousy. I wasn't expecting much at the time. But having longed to see Helm's Deep on the big screen for so long, when I saw Jackson's "Fellowship.." I developed a faith that it could actually happen. Never in my wildest imaginings would I have expected to be contemplating leaving in the middle of it. The thought actually crossed my mind that 'maybe the whole thing is really just a bad dream and then I'll wake up and we'll go see the real movie'. My wife, who is the real Tolkien fan of the family, was left literally in tears.For those who are interested, here's the most complete list of major (ie not just nitpicking about lines added or sideways glances omitted) changes that we could put togetherGandalf literally excorcises Saruman from posession of Theoden The character of Faramir is radically different Gimli is mostly comic reliefNew subplot with dog riders attacking the people of Rohan en route to Helm's deep, aragorn's "death" and Arwen's (apparent) descision not to stay with him.Theoden is much less heroic at Helm's Deep and has to be coaxed into doing anything.Elves show up to announce their alliance with the humans and save the day at Helm's Deep (????)The women and children of Rohan are kept in Helm's deep instead of another keep in the mountains apparently for no other reason than to give us lots and lots (and lots) of shots of women and children crying during the fight. Eowyn is therefore there at the battle, but neither fighting nor having been given stewardship over her people.Ents have to be tricked by pippin to decide to to do anything about SarumanNo shelob *Gandalf does not confront Saruman (he's never even at Isengard) *Gandalf and co never receive the plantir (black, spherical seer stone thing) *
* = this may just have been moved to the beginning of the third movie.
I went in with the highest of expectations thinking Jackson was going to pull it off again with all the mystical beauty that Fellowship captured. Well boy was I in for a surprise. Not only did it fail miserably in development of character and storyline, it was a mistake to have Gimley being a joking dwarf? Who wants to hear one line jokes every other 10 mins. And WTF with Gollum being half of a jar jar binks? Gollum Binks is not what I was looking for? The score was almost unbearable and compared to the first score I can't believe that this one was so Muted and desperate in searching for the right moment. I just got home from the engagement of the 11:59 Pm show on 12-17-02. My friend and I are Ring Die hards and decided to get a first look at the much anticipated sequel.... We are both in a state of shock over how it never got into the flow of any thing near what the Fellowship had accomplished. I was saying I know at the Opening Premiere for the cast at the end they all went...."UH OH" inside there heads. And then proceeded to try and trick themselves into believing it was a work of art. Horrible follow up and one of the biggest all time single failures in sequels. You will see what I'am saying when you see it.It was better than most movies out but for the fact that Jackson and crew did such an astonishing job on the first I thought since they filmed them all together he was on to something with a special vibe he had created with this mystical bond? Nope........... Big Let Down.......


                
Words cannot express the joy I felt when this second installment of Lord of the Rings hit the screens. My joy was short-lived, however, as I discovered that this second in the trilogy was as painful as exercising on a push bike with diarrhoea.The first of the trilogy was an excellent film, even for someone like me who isn't a big fan on there so-called 'fantasy epics'. Did no one mention to Tolkien that he'd just rewritten the Conan Chronicles, with the only difference being that he couldn't even be bothered to make more female characters? Okay, so we know Tolkien must have been gay for that reason. No matter. The film of the first book was spectacular - battle scenes like I'd never seen before, dialogue that was crisp and sharp, and I really felt for the characters.The Two Towers was just the opposite. The fight scenes were nothing new - in fact, if they had taken out all the fight scenes, there would have been nothing left in the film! I'm very disappointed that they didn't make this film more dialogue-driven rather than effects and battle-driven. Granted that the book has numerous battles, to me this translated badly onto the cellular screen. For me, films must be ADAPTED from books, not merely copied scene-for-scene.One person commented that this film require a new scale because 10 cannot do it justice. Erm, 10 means perfection; and as far as I'm concerned, no film ever deserves a 10. The Godfather comes close, so does Star Wars (episode 4), and perhaps Casablanca.Watching the Two Towers gave me the same feeling of disappointment that I felt when I watched Matrix Reloaded - it put me off wanting to watch the final installment. Which is a shame, because the last of the trilogy (both Matrix and LOTR) is much better than the second of the trilogy in both cases.In terms of 'completeness', I would recommend watching this film only because you need it to bridge the first and third LOTR films. If you want to watch a film purely for its entertainment value, you're better off watching "I, Robot". At least you get to see Will Smith get beaten up many times lol.The Two Towers scores a generous 3/10 for me, only because you need it to watch the far superior final installment.
Perhaps my judgment is a bit skewed, having camped out 30 hours for the premier of this movie and expecting to see the gates of heaven open up as soon as they turned on the projectors (I had high expectations of this film), But I think that Peter Jackson should be shot repeatedly with a BB gun for what he did to Tolkien's masterpiece.  I mean, even in the first movie when he left out Tom Bombadil I could understand the reasoning.  But if you're going to cut something for reasons of time, DON'T ADD ANYTHING! Everything that was added to this movie was total crap from an oliphaunt's ass.  Any true fan of Tolkien should be incensed at the utter butchering of the story.  I could go into examples, but I'm sorta strapped for time currently, and I'm sure they've been discussed at length here (I'm a little late, but I just registered here, so... well you know).  The only redeeming qualities were the first 10 minutes, and the way they did gollum (although the portrayal of the character was more humourous than it should have been).
All this being said...  I'll probably end up buying the 4-disc special edition DVD and camping out overnight in preparation for Return of the King...  :)
