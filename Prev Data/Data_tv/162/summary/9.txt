 It's a good watch

 Enter the psychopath's mind

 I almost gave up one this one..

 Fascinating & absorbing

 Intense. Fascinating. Maybe even brilliant.

 Not your typical Hollywood rubbish....

 Violent mind develops? Mental disorder? Or just plain evil?

 Look into the abyss... at your own risk...

 It got me hooked after a couple of episodes

 Behind the Scenes of a Criminal mind

 Classic Fincher

 Tense, Dark, and Brilliant

 Brilliant

 Give it a 2nd chance, this show will redeem itself

 Watch till the end.

 Amazing series

 Excellent!

 Not like those other Detective Shows

 Reveting

 Twisted Beauty

 Binge worthy - Delve into the mind of ruthless criminals

 Excellent case work.

 Netflix delivers another resounding success of a TV show.

 Informative and engaging - the normality of the psycho killer is revealing.

 Netflix, you got my attention
