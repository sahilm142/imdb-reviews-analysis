 Cruel intentions...

 A tasteless exercise in violence.

 Wow, a movie about gangsters cussing and waffling on, BORING!

 One of the most inane and dated movies of our time

 Second-hand, second-rate cut-and-paste job.

 One of the ten worst movies ever

 Over rated

 Dumb and boring.

 Sorry, but this is a overrated movie !!!

 Violence for violence's sake might set a bad precedent

 Pure undiluted crap

 If this is a gangster movie where are all the cool robberies that gangsters are supposed to do?

 If you appreciate your time, just don't watch this

 What a load of trash with no redeeming value.

 Yet another worthless effort by Tarantino...

 A Disgusting piece of GARBAGE!

 One of the worst movies ever made

 Garbage

 not Tarantino's movie at all !!

 This movie sucks

 crime pays for tarantino

 Pure Useless

 This movie was a HUGE letdown

 One of the most over-rated films of ALL time.

 The antithesis of a masterpiece
