 Not bad, but not the best

 If you read the other reviews CAREFULLY...

 Bittersweet. Best to binge watch.

 Needs something more

 Don't believe the hype

 Great Crime Show but without much of Detection Work !

 Hmm..not quite sure what to say

 Intelligibility

 Mostly Great 3 Seasons and an Awful Final One

 It is not a masterpiece, but it's almost good enough

 Series 1 Review - Overlook a few flaws and you have a very entertaining show

 acting, directing, style, music great but too much unrealistic behaviour

 It gets painfully boring to watch at times

 Good potential but fell flat for me

 Luther Ex Machina

 Two episodes? Two? The whole fourth season is TWO episodes?
