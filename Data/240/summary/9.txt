 Haunting and brilliant!

 My brief review of the film

 Simply Magic!

 Another spectacular 80s Miyazaki blowout

 Castle in the sky is a dream come true

 Another great film from Miyazaki

 Is Hollywood listening yet?

 Yet another Miyazaki masterpiece (surprise)

 HIDDEN ANIME GEM

 Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a near perfect Ghibli debut from the master of anime himself.

 The movie has a touch of magic and science fiction.

 An enchanting exploration through heart and imagination, Hayou Miyazaki's Castle in The Sky is a spellbinding journey

 unforgettable fantasy

 One of Studio Ghibli's best

 First true Ghibli film and a testament to its talent

 Castle in the Sky is a wonderfully made movie, filled to the brim with fun action scenes and hilarious jokes.

 One of my favourite Studio Ghibli films!...

 Splendid but weird

 Funny, light hearted, and enjoyable for the entire family

 If east be English

 Another lovely Studio Ghibli cartoon

 Disney is far away from Miyazaki

 Awesome movie
