Interesting idea for a movie but many problems in this attempt.The actors were not so pleasant to look at and to listen to with their advanced age.  The side characters might have held more interest but they remained background dressing.The main defect in ESKIYA is with a plot that is too over-the-top and unrealistic.  The Bandit leaves prison after 35 years and searches for two people who have moved to some unknown location within a major city of 10,000,000 people.  How can he find them with no clues?Easy.  He goes to the city and watches TV for 5 or ten minutes and POOF! There on TV is one of the people he wants to find!The Bandit meets this man found via TV and he is told that the wife of this man, the other person the Bandit is searching for, has not spoken one single word ever since the Bandit went to prison 35 years before!  What man remains a devoted husband for 35 years to a passionless wife who does not even bother to speak to him?The husband has a final experiment to attempt to make his wife speak... The husband wants the Bandit to visit with the wife and try to have her talk. If this is such a worthy plan, why did not the husband take the wife to visit the Bandit in prison 5 years earlier, or 10 years earlier, or 15 years earlier, or 20 years earlier, etc.?The main plot is very unbelievable and this removes all entertainment potential.


                
All the actors are so lame that a 2 year boy can act much better than the main characters.The main theme was so much similar to Léon: The Professional. At the ending I thought that the writer must liked Leon so much to make one of that for his own.The Turkish making this movie at the top by hitting the 10/10 button.Sharknado has more plot twist and better story line than The bandit. Please don't waste your 128 min of your life. Its better to stare at a ceiling than watching this movie.Don't believe in this Turkish people's hoax.
