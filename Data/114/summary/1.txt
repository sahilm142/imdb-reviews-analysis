 Misleading advertising. Not for children

 UP - the Saddest Cartoon Ever..

 You need more than just an idea

 What are you people talking about?The Emperor has no clothes!

 Rediculiously overrated!

 Overrated and a Disgrace to Pixar

 "Up" worst of 2009 so far

 Worst high-budget film I've ever seen

 Movie sucked pond water

 Not for sensitive people

 Why I personally believe this movie is trash.

 Good Animations, Awful Overall

 DOWN WITH "UP"! Trite, Saccharine, and Ugly...

 ... am I supposed to care?

 The Worst Animated Movie in a Long Time

 The most overrated animation of all time!

 This should be called DOWN.

 blech

 What the fuuuuuuuuh

 A rip off
