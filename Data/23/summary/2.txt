 This must be the most overrated movie in Hollywood history

 Just a lame psycho and a kiddo playing hide and seek

 If Hannibal fight Jason, who is gonna win?

 A very average film... with lots of plot holes

 Glorification of psychopaths

 Too pedestrian

 At least it was better than the book.

 stupid

 There are many different kinds of cheese. And in this case, mold isn't a good thing.

 Six, twisted and shallow.

 Warning; not a silent film

 Boring 2 <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A5>
