 CGI drivel disguised as something epic

 Please stop the Hype!

 Too much going on. Overrated

 disappointment

 Honestly

 Too many characters, prolonged action scenes become monotonous

 It's so dense...

 Really poor implementation of The Avengers' Characters

 Hey let's just put every hero into a new movie. $$$

 cannot figure out why this is a box office success

 Superhero's have overstayed their welcome

 Disappointed

 Worst Marvel film ever so far

 Waste of Time

 What a waste of time

 Below average movie

 Incomprehensible Unless You're a Fan

 Not worth it

 Visually magnificent, technically state-of-the-art, dumber than a box of hammers

 Avengers a flutter

 Won't watch avengers part 4

 Heavy Indigestion

 Totally disappointing! Waste of time and money

 Very poorly handled

 Absolute Garbage.
