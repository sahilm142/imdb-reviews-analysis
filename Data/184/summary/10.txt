 The Critics where wrong about the song in 1975,and they are wrong about the movie in 2018

 One of my favorites in 75 years

 Queen is king!!

 It makes you wish you where born earlier

 Truly brilliant.

 Extraordinary & Mind-blowing.

 Rami Malek you rock!

 Those movies who make the critics look like a bunch a monkeys

 The crtics are wrong!

 I never watched movie 2 times in cinema. Until BohRap

 Breathtakingly beautiful

 This IS QUEEN!!

 What movie did the critics see? Certainly not this one !

 Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury is worthy of an Oscar

 Never heard a cinema audience give a round of applause

 A celebration not an expose

 Friends will be friends right till the end 11/10

 And the Oscar goes to...

 Wow wow wow

 A reminder --- Don't always rely on the critics when selecting a movie to see

 Extraordinarily nice!!! (Excuse the pun)

 Malek is brilliant!

 Wow! Just wow

 Made Me Actually Cry!!!

 Don't listen to the critics
