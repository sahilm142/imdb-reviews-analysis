 Overlong and uninteresting horror flick......

 A successful comedy, unfortunately by accident

 Missing vital elements of the book

 Not so scary as people say

 Ponderous, predictable

 One Of The Dullest "Shinings" Ever

 Kubrick's Nihilism Desecrates King's Humanism

 a disjointed, "Kubrickized" adaptation

 Nasty, brutish and long

 What was Kubrick thinking of?

 Bad story, Annoying music, Good acting

 A tedious, overblown, overrated waste of time and money

 Overrated

 Laughable at Best

 Kubrick's Dropped Ball

 2 Versions of this Movie

 This has to be the most overrated movie EVER

 Kubrick's Weakness

 What Is The Point?

 An unusually sloppy Kubrick effort

 From King to Kubrick

 Worst casting

 i can't be a fan, as much as i like kubrick

 Self-conscious and in some ways cliched

 So much time, not enough scares
