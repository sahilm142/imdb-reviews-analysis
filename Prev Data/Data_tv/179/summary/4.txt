 Are we watching the same show?!

 Overated

 A letdown

 Could have been, but wasn't

 Promising plot let down by poor subtitles

 Pretty bad

 HORRIBLY DONE

 this is too painful to watch

 Huge Disappointment

 This show is breathtakingly bad

 Ridiculous plot

 La casa de stupido

 idea is good but messed up characters with many points unconvincing

 English voiceovers destroy this show

 Great to Garbage 1970s fantasy

 8+ rating is not justfied

 If you still like it after all these plot holes...

 This show is SO corny but entertaining
