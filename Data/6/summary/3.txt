 Can we criticize this movie now?

 I found this to be very boring

 Gross manipulation and a trial to watch

 Terrible misrepresentation of German soldiers of that era

 Pretentious Drivel

 Waste of time

 Not a Top-10 Movie

 Black and White- yet no Grey.

 It could have been amazing but it's just oscar bait.

 Well intended, but extremely flawed

 A poor effort

 Not impressive.

 Average

 Simply I did not think it was that good
