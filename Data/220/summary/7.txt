 The origin story of one of the most iconic cinema-heroes

 More than a boxing movie

 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

 1976's Spoil

 Time has taken something from it

 An Involving Movie In the Face of Its Otherwise Hackneyed Substance

 Of the Rocky's probably the most realistic.

 Stirring movie and genuinely entertaining

 The underdog

 Stallone's strong writing power flies high in this award-winning "B-movie".

 Wish I'd got around to seeing it sooner

 Twizard Rating: 74

 40 years old and still a good movie

 Good

 Schlocky...

 It's OK....

 There's little sense in criticizing its weaknesses...the picture is fool-proof

 The Ultimate American Success Story....Just in Time for America's 100th Birthday

 A winner

 Only In America

 Basic, yet inspiring

 The best Rocky
