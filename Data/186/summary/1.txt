 What a shame

 An insulting piece of cowardice

 Overrated, Boring and Not worth the Time

 Slippery Hollow

 Thoroughly annoying, vacuous and simplistic

 don't over analyze

 As the years go on this film will be laughed at!!

 A movie to sleep through

 One of the WORST films I have ever seen...

 Not that good

 Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey)has had his whole life caught on camera since birth even though he doesn't know it.

 Whoever gave this a 10 should be shot.

 Horrible

 Crap

 two hours of my life i will never get back

 Symbolic of an Amoral Society

 See EDTV Instead.

 The Nixon Show
