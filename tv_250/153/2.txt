What is this? I often find myself asking that same question over and over. The comedy is to in your face and just simply not funny. It's like a sketch comedy show, without the comedy. It's as if no thought goes into these skits. There's no punchline, there's no jokes. Just failed attempts at comedy. The characters are annoying & dull, the production is cheap and the same tag line is used over and over. I don't see how you can find this funny. I haven't laughed once. It's so bad that every time an episode airs I'm forced to change the channel. I mean you have to laugh at pretty much anything to find this funny. I'll stick to the good classic shows. Aqua Teen and Squidbillies.
