 Lock, Stock, and Many Smoking Barrels

 Classic!

 Weeding through the Cockney slang is half the experience

 Snatch has it all

 But I like style over substance. Who took the jam out of your donut?

 Better than "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" - more fun, more lively, and generally just better

 Put All The Good Things From Lock Stock Altogether, Then Adds Some More

 Still a clone, but a good one

 The English Pulp Fiction (out of time, Ritchie!)

 Snatch.: 8/10

 Will "Snatch" Your Attention!

 Snatch-Conversational gangster movie.

 Blast of hooligan gangster fun

 Lots of Laughs, Violence & Snappy Dialogue

 Very Great Movie !

 Great Fun

 a must see Film.

 Is this the same Guy who made... SWEPT AWAY?!

 Snatch Pitt

 fast,hilarant,well done

 The Year Of The Heist (2001) kicks off with a gem

 Tough laughs for strong stomach types.

 Snatch is a story in the telling

 Fast-paced and shallow-bursting at its very best

 If you've seen "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels", you know what to expect
