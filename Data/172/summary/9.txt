 All it Takes is One Line of Dialogue to Make an Impact...

 Shutter Island is at the top of its genre

 Of all the movies in theatres to see, this is worth your time

 Great a must watch !!

 Counting down the days until I can add this to my DVD collection...

 The beautiful film

 A fantastic film with DiCapro

 Shocking and Brilliant,

 Go See The Doctor

 Brilliant, brilliant movie full of paranoia in Hitchcock style

 Leo DiCaprio was brilliant & plenty of twists

 Situation Theory

 I know it's convoluted and slow, but stick with this one...really.

 Verdict: Engaging, entertaining, and intelligent — if you let it suck you in.

 Twisted, somber, but hugely entertaining Scorcese thriller

 A Heartbreaking Character Study Masquerading as a Mystery

 DiCaprio shines in a perfect adaptation

 Shutter Island: A great movie on either side of the walls

 Brilliant adaption

 Scorsese does it again

 Have to watch twice!

 Leonardo DiCaprio, salute you soldier.

 Crazy is catching

 Even Better The Second Time!

 drowning in imaginations
