 Entertaining Revolution - V for Vendetta

 Ideas Are Bulletproof

 Strong Statement, if not Execution

 Intelligent film with political criticism , thrills , action and suspense

 Eye for Itself

 Fairly intelligent and equally enjoyable filmmaking.

 Pretty alright...

 Visually impressive, but surprisingly shallow

 V for Victorious!

 Remember remember V for Vendetta...

 flashy fast

 "A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having."

 They get it , and politically miss it

 Loud, Brash and Disappointing

 V for Vindictive?

 A Tragic Waste

 overrated

 The rise to overthrowing power has begun...

 Republicans won't like this movie

 V for Vocal Political Point

 V is for "V"ery political and still "V"ery stylish

 Mixed

 Does fascism justify terrorism?

 Best film of the 2006...DEFINITELY!

 A Beautiful Film-Quite enjoyable -I highly recommend it.
