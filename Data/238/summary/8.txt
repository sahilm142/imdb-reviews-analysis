 HK Neo Reviews: Before Sunset

 Sooo simple!

 when the moments strike again

 Great, and more substantial than Before Sunrise

 Good movies

 Great romance - much better than Before Sunrise

 There is much love, but not enough time.

 Haunting, Entrancing, every bit as wonderful as its already cult status indicates

 One of the finest trilogies of all time.
