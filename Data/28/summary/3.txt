 Too clever for it's own good.

 The final destination isn't worth the trip

 Would you still love me....

 Surprising ending with little behind it

 a mixed review

 Average action movie with twist

 Are we watching the same movie?

 Smoke and Mirrors

 Cold and shallow neo-noir

 Not my type of film...

 Overrated

 Absolute Garbage

 usual suspects usual plot

 Didn't live up to its hype
