 Magnificent portrait of organized crime

 The Greatest Movie Ever Made

 One Can See Why It's So Highly-Rated

 A movie that can not be abandoned

 A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity

 Respect

 A little over rated, but I know good film making when I see it

 What an outstanding cinema work

 IT'S JUST TOO LONG

 Oh, Those Corleones....

 One of the all time greatest

 What is there to say?

 Allow "The Godfather" to make you an offer you can't refuse

 The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.

 Simply a great classic, number one on many lists.

 Hard to refuse

 not the godfather of all movies

 This was an Awesome movie which i ever watched in my life

 Brando's aged make-up is incredible

 The most incredible art piece of the 20th century

 One of the greatest movies of all time

 One Of The Greatest

 Al Pacino Best Movies

 It's the ultimate groundbreaker in mob films.

 Amazing
