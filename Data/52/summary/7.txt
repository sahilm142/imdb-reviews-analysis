 Solid suspense film set in space

 In space no one can hear your scream, but your neighbor can...

 A bit overrated

 Average spacecraft thriller.

 The worst in the series but still an ok movie.

 A flawed classic that provided the blueprint to better movies of it's kind

 I give this film credit for the inspiration it has given to so many other movies. But I felt certain things where missing.

 Alien-a review in 2015

 what are you talking about?!?

 A landmark in sci-fi, however some big issues with plot lacking realism

 Good

 An Alien Cat Ate My Coworker

 7/10

 Pretty good but aliens is better

 Captivating thriller but fails to address bigger questions...

 Technically well made, but let down by an anticlimactic ending

 I Was Four Then<U+0085>This was Truly Alien to Me

 Great 70s SciFi-Horror Flick

 New Frontiers of Fear

 This movie is a pioneer for Sci-Fi films!

 a Classic of horror

 Review of a film about the dangers of being too curious

 I remain underwhelmed, I'm afraid

 Boring!
