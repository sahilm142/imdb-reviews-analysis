 One of the best Turkish movies ever

 Really good but overrated for sure..

 Unabashed Melodrama with its Roots in Yesilçam

 "When a person grows up, do his dreams become smaller?"

 emotional eruption

 Good movie

 A must see Movie by all family Members

 Great Actor ; Cetin Tekindor and Very Good Movie for Turkish Cinema
