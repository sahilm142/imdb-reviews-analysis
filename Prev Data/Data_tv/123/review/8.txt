High school is for many the defining moment for the crossover from childhood to adulthood. Its a period that has its charms and certainly its complications. "The first experience" for so many things happen here. You can fall in love, break up, feel jealous and insecure and will probably have your first sexual experience. Social media will shape and form these experiences with all of its possibilities and pitfalls. A very easy identified theme in many movies and series, that depicts these years, centers around the feeling of being awkward which Skam also does to a certain extent.Skam hits all of these themes spot on with a well adjusted pace, young actors that seem very comfortable in front of the camera showing emotions of vulnerability.It flirts with social drama but the themes doesn't weigh you down as a lot of humour is blended in but without betrayal.The way I see it the show have a broad appeal given its theme of young adulthood and having a gallery of so many different personalities that identification should be possible.I will recommend the story of Vilde, Noora, Chris, Eva and Sana to anyone who either have a direct of indirect connection to youth culture of today or to anyone else who has the curiosity of an anthropologist towards this theme.Regards SimonPs.
