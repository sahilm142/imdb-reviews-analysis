 A masterful continuation of the original saga

 For those who liked the weirdest parts of Twin Peaks

 This review is to encourage newcomers and give some explanation of what to expect.

 Quirky must see

 So far the style is similar to the movie, not the series, yet still interesting and enjoyable

 Worth watching but a mixed bag

 Gotta stick with it

 Overload - Lynch has fun & shows a middle finger to the average viewer

 Confusing and strange...exactly what you would expect!

 Just re-watched Part 8

 Psychedelic

 My Take!

 Makes me feel like I have bees in my head.

 The same Twin Peaks, but with Skype and wireless networks

 Echo's & True Nightmares
