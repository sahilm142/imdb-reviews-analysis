 A Perfect Anime 10!

 A Truly Original Sci-Fi/Comedy/Noir Mashup with an Incredible Original Soundtrack

 One of the greatest anime shows

 One of the best written series out there

 One hell of a ride SpaceCowboy!

 Brings anime to level not duplicated since

 Way Cool

 this anime is one of the bests out there

 the han solo of anime if it were to be like STAR WARS

 Episodically a masterpiece, as a continuous story it falls short

 A pretty damn good anime series

 Cowboy Bebop

 I'm Not Your Average Otaku, Part 2

 Amazing story, that leaves you in awe

 Do yourself a favour and watch it!

 They're right....
