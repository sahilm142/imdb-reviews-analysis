 Cinematic Theater Of A Remarkable Kind

 "My counsel says we were not aware of the extermination of the millions. He would give you the excuse: We were only aware of the extermination of the hundreds."

 Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?

 ~One of the most Powerful Films ever made.~

 When films like this can be made.......

 Revelation of Horror

 One of the most thrilling and thought provoking movie of all times

 A Film Of Enduring Value

 Magnificent film based on actual events with top-notch performances by all star cast

 Fantastic acting, script, and direction in a thought-provoking movie

 Do the right thing.

 A sickening truth, A story needed to be told.

 A True Cinematic Masterpiece

 The Hare Was Shot by the Hunter in the Bunker

 A great humanistic document, compelling and nearly timeless

 Great acting and Movie

 A film that stands the test if time

 One of the most important films about the war and its meaning in the perspective of history.

 Well made, very grave and somewhat dull

 " Just for laughs general, what was the war all about? "

 Only true victim is humanity

 Superb exploration of morality

 Reflections from watching "Judgement at Nuremberg" again

 Post war courtroom drama still challenging and powerful today
