 I must whole heartidly disagree

 A psycho dreaming of picket fences and the little woman...? Don't think so.

 Nice try

 Nothing new

 Form cannot redeem this content

 This movie is horrible!

 What's the fuss?

 Dreary, gratuitous and in the end totally illogical.

 Nice concept, too many holes

 an ugly, abusive assault on the audience

 Lacks Se7en out of 10 Stars: Whats in the Box? Sucks?

 Excellent craft work but not art

 Only 5 for 7

 A little creepy but very boring!

 Mediocre slash-movie with pretensions

 Am I missing something?

 It's not Raymond Chandler's Simple Art of Murder

 It's disturbing that I feel so.. disturbed...

 Not a good film

 Terrible character interaction

 pierced navel gazing

 Stupid B serial killer movie from the 90's got a big hype

 I really don't get why this film is so highly rated, it's clever and all and the acting is A+ but the terrible ending ruins it for me.

 Great movie - but ...

 Worst movie i ever watched
