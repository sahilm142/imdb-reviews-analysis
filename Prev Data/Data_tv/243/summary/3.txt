 Non-event counter-moves

 Overrated show with one dimensional story and stereotypical characters

 Good acting bad writing

 Tries hard, but flops

 Mediocre, Superficial.

 Not bad in first two seasons, third season pretty poor

 Get Real!

 Should Have Named It Boring

 All surprises aren't good surprises
