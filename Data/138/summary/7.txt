 Interesting ending from Argentine movie

 Definitely NOT a waste of time, but there was potential for more

 Intriguing but Sloppy

 Unrequited Love, Retribution, Friendship, Fear and Passion

 Eyes inspire a masterpiece

 A pride of Latin American cinema

 Great technicalities supporting a solid story

 a telenovela gets the Oscar?

 Dark 70s

 Enjoyable, but completely overrated

 Interesting

 The Best-Selling Argentine Film

 Naïve, goofy script scuttles an otherwise promising effort
