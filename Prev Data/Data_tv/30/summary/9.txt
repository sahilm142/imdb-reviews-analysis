 Definitely worth seeing!

 The best program I have seen in years

 Utterly disturbing in the best possible way

 Disturbing? Yes, it's "Black Mirror"

 Really interesting and well-written satire

 clever prophetic dark twisted satire

 Modern day twilight zone

 My generation's Twilight Zone.

 A Shock

 "Black Mirror"--"Dark Reflections of the Mind"

 To tell right from wrong

 A modern day Twilight Zone

 Great show.

 Re-defining the SciFi genre

 Depression in a form of a serie

 Another great season

 Interesting

 Anyone Who Knows What Love Is Will Understand

 Totally brilliant series designed to encourage deep disquiet.

 A few quick words on "Black Mirror" Season 1 (2011)

 just brilliant but watch out from imdb rating

 A mind blown

 At least one episode every individual can enjoy.

 Keep watching it

 Dark and bright
