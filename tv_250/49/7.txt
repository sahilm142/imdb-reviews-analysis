I Claudius has been in the national television of Greece when I was a young boy and I watched it with interest without understanding clearly its' depth or message. The costumes and demeanor of the actors impressed me and I was transposed unto another world. It was again played when the private television explosion had occurred. It was an interesting piece of work, although I could not avoid being bored sometimes due to the fact that I have not been nourished in the British theatrical tradition and have no theatrical education. The affinity with theater made me to feel rather awkward and I had the impression that sometimes the whole project was beyond me. I had an acquaintance with the work of Robert Graves in general and the Claudius novels in particular. The period interested me. It is obvious that the project did not aim to being a super-production presenting countless legions in action but was targeted on the day-to-day intrigues of the Imperial court, happening in-doors. The imperial experience of Britain helped the writer handling such a thing although the attitude is not one of glorification but one of irony and comedy. Obviously the imperial British of Graves time were quite sure of themselves viewing the imperial adventures of the role-models with ironic detachment. BBC has been a trademark of quality in historical dramas and its' reputation vindicated with that production. I would find it interesting though if the tried to narrate the history of some conquered family from Gaul for a change.
