I can't believe this overblown, overwrought three-hour snorefest gets so much acclaim.  It may have looked great back in 1959, and I must admit that the chariot race still looks pretty impressive, but it's just a single bright spot in the otherwise unmemorable film. The story itself is quite majestic and epic, but unfortunately brought down by the laughably dated visuals, sluggish pace and terrible acting. Charlton Heston, in particular, gives one of the most wooden performances I've ever seen, to the point where his "menacing" stares and bared teeth brought unintentional giggles on my part. Overall, Ben-Hur is a film that just doesn't stand the test of time.


                
First of all this movie was just HORRIBLY boring. The chariot race is he only good thing in this movie. i will give the movie credit for that. i don't know how the hell they did that back than. Second, Charlton Heston is probably the most overrated actor to win an Oscar. maybe he just has a type of acting i just don't like... I still say Monty Python's Life of Brian is way way better. I guess the reason i probably don't like this movie is just because I am not a religious person and just don't care about movies like this. Overall if you are wanting to study film you should see this movie, its a very historical movie, but a great movie? no its not.


                
Movie making really have come a long way. With the advent of DVD and the release of Gladiator, this is one of the oldies that's been way over hyped, so I rented it. Oh boy, what a terrible movie. It must be over 4 hours long, and there's possibly only about 40 minutes of movie worth watching here.
Avoid this film if you value your time.
