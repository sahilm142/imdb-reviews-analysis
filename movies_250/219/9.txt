"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest westerns ever made, although much of the movie takes place in South America.  It is a great look at two likeable outlaws, full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are two bank robbers, chased by the law.  The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do.  The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them.  There is really no connection all the way through, for the most part.The story isn't about the plot, however.  It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It is a close look at two criminals, the talented Sundance Kid, and Butch Cassidy, the one who does all the thinking.  The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film.  Watching the two interact, with a superb script full of great dialogue, is what makes this movie so exciting.See this movie if you are a fan of westerns, or just a fan of good movies. It is exciting, superbly made (with lots of interesting silent scenes to music and montages of photographs), but it also has a lot of depth.**** out of ****

George Roy Hill's funny Western is still modern and hasn't aged bad at all. Paul Newman is charming and charismatic, and Robert Redford is energetic. I don't know why some Western-fans doesn't like it because it is filled with powerful and spectacular gunfights, humor, friendship and beautiful pictures - which is the reasons why you watch Westerns, isn't it? I am fully aware of the fact that 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' was an unusual Western when it came. After this there were other attempts or experiments made like this but I don't think that they succeeded. 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' has also the rare ability to even smell, taste or feel classic when you watch it ... Robert Redford was never better than here.Rating: 9 of 10.


                
I can remember seeing this movie, at the Colony Theater in Portsmouth Virginia, when it was first released. Since then, I've seen it at least 30 times, most recently last night. In my humble opinion, Paul Newman & Robert Redford made an excellent movie twosome 30 years ago [and expanded on it a few years later, in The Sting]. In reading the reviews submitted about this movie it makes me happy to see that most of the people agree with my opinion. How could you not like these characters, along with Etta, "those guys" following them and eventually Strother [who will always be remembered for his "what we have here is a failure to communicate" in Cool Hand Luke] Martin? Not to mention the scenes where Etta enters the picture, when Butch has to fight Logan, when they have to jump in the water and, of course, the ending sequence of events. I won't say "they don't make them like they used to", but this one is a keeper. And if you agree with my evaluation, and have a DVD player, watch the DVD that has interviews, etc., to give you an even better picture of this excellent movie.


                
A truly revisionist western in the best sense of the term, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" was one of the quintessential American movies of the sixties; a huge commercial success and showered with Oscars. Over the years it has gone somewhat out of fashion but it is still a ground-breaking classic no matter how you look at it. It moves seamlessly between seriousness and a beautifully honed comic sensibility continually buoyed up by one of the greatest of all screenplays by William Goldman, too jokey for some, perhaps, but clever, myth-making and intelligent and while many movies that seemed so much of their period or which wore their influences a little too obviously, (in this case, the French New Wave), "Butch ... and Sundance ..." certainly isn't one of them.Admittedly Newman and Redford coast their way through the film; they look like they are having too much fun. This is laconic acting at its most laconic, but Conrad Hall's photography is still stunning so the film looks as good as it sounds. I have no doubt that George Roy Hill's subsequent Newman/Redford pairing "The Sting"'s best picture Oscar was one given to make up for "Butch's" failure to take home the big prize.


                
Let me state right now that "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the greatest westerns of all time. It even deserves its place in the top 100 of America's best movies (#73). This writer even rated the film nine stars. It deserves all of them. On the other hand, its heroes are really anti-heroes. Yes they are the criminals, but because they are good-looking and likable and charming and humorous we root for them. But this is not the message of the traditional westerns that were about the noble guys who won in the end (played by William S. Hart, Tom Mix, Gene Autry, John Wayne, etc.) and the dastardly dudes who got what they deserved (real folks like Bill Longley, Black Jack Ketchum, John Wesley Hardin, Ike Clanton, etc.). These bad guys were so unabashedly immoral that people booed them in movie theaters. But for several years before 1969, the framework of the original American Western was transforming. Perhaps movie audiences became bored with the good guys winning. Then there were the attitudes of the counter-culture. So characters of ambiguous morality began to become central; if they still lost at film's end, they at least got sympathy. Our movie is about the "Wild Bunch," last of the outlaw gangs of the old American West. Its specialty was robbing banks and trains on horseback. But the frontier had closed in 1890, and even the remaining wild western pockets were becoming less of a haven. Not only was the telegraph expanding, but the telephone and automobile were already invented. Civilization and technology were making the old time gunslingers obsolete. The Pinkerton detectives and the Union Pacific Railroad were becoming more resourceful. There were less and less places of refuge, although Butch Cassidy's band did well enough at Hole-in-the-Wall pass (north of Casper in Wyoming).The feature is finely crafted, although it probably gathers more from the legend rather than from historical fact. There are many wonderful things to enjoy: The gorgeous cinematography of Conrad Hall (filmed in USA/Mexico) and fine Western settings, the music by Burt Bacharach, the script by William Goldman, the direction of George Roy Hill. The film gathered four Academy awards: Cinematography, score, song ("Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"), and original screenplay. There are quite a few memorable scenes: Opening Thomas Edison Company silent movie that features The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, fancy gun-work by the Sundance Kid in the sepia-toned vignette, Butch and Logan in the knife fight during the gang rebellion, the blown-up express car with flying dollar bills, continuous posse chases, the Newman-Ross bicycle scene, an angry bull, the cliff jump on horseback, the near-botched bank robbery in Bolivia where the two men clumsily attempt to speak Spanish, the ending freeze frame shootout. Although folks get shot in this film, we are spared the endless gore that characterized some filmmakers, like Sam Peckinpah.The Chemistry between Paul Newman, already a big star, and upcoming Robert Redford is masterful. Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) is the talker, the planner, the brains of the outfit; the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) is silent and brooding, but also quick with a gun. Wittily the two leads play off against one another in a sardonic manner. A third important lead, the lovely Katherine Ross (Etta Place), plays a delightful foil between the two men. By the way, two surviving photographs confirm that the real Etta (Ethel) Place was one of the most attractive females of the Old West. Some of the real gang members are also characters: Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy), Flat-Nose Curry (Charles Dierkop), and News Carver (Timothy Scott). Bonus Information: Butch Cassidy (née Robert Leroy Parker), born in 1866, called his gang "The Wild Bunch," not "The-Hole-in-the-Wall Gang." As befitting the grandson of a Mormon bishop, he was affable and eschewed excessive gunplay. "I have never killed a man," he claimed. Butch Cassidy really did blow up a United Pacific railroad express car to smithereens near Wilcox, Wyoming on 2 June 1899. (Employee E.C. Woodcock was staggered, but survived.) Pinkerton agent Charles Angelo Siringo was already hot on the trail. Siringo's name was not used in the movie. Instead we hear Lord Baltimore and Joe Lefors and the United Pacific posse. But it was Charlie Siringo (Siringo knew Lefors) who trailed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (née Harry Alonzo Longabaugh) for 25,000 miles, as he wrote in one of his books. Because of an error by another, Siringo just missed capturing Butch and Sundance. (By the way, Siringo tracked desperadoes from Alaska to Mexico.) In 1900 an attempt at amnesty between Butch and Utah Governor Wells failed. Nevertheless, the Old West was dying, and Butch, Sundance, and Etta Place, after visiting New York City (1901), "relocated" to South America in Argentina. Sundance may have married Etta in December 1900. More than once Sundance and Etta returned to the USA; apparently they attended the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. Pinkerton agent Frank Di Maio, who took over from Charlie Siringo in Argentina, had discovered the exact location of Sundance and Etta, but either a tip or the rainy season ruined his chances of capture. Etta Place returned to the USA for good in 1906/1907; her subsequent history is largely unknown. Butch and Sundance met their eventual demise at San Vincente, Bolivia in November 1908 or at Montevideo, Uruguay in 1912. Flat- Nose Curry, News Carver, and Harvey Logan were already dead. Curry was shot to death by a sheriff in 1900; Carver was killed by lawmen in 1901. To escape capture in 1904 after he had escaped from jail, Logan shot himself. Not mentioned in the movie was William Ellsworth "Elzy" Lay, last of the Wild Bunch. Although he was captured, tried, and sent to prison in 1899, he did a very good deed in jail. So he was pardoned by New Mexico Governor Otero in 1906. Thereafter Lay went straight for the rest of his life; he died in 1934.
After the special posse of experts is finally formed and is pursuing them too well, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) move their bank robbing business to South America accompanied by the Kid's girlfriend, Etta (Katharine Ross).This was the breakout role for Robert Redford's movie career (Redford named the "Sundance Institute" and the annual "Sundance Film Festival" that he founded in honor of this effect). While some respected critics, e.g., Roger Ebert & many others (see the 50% ratings of 'rotten' by 'top critics' reviews of this film on "Rotten Tomatoes") regard this movie as overdone or only "so-so," or "not western enough," most viewers find it still greatly entertaining and interesting. I agree with the majority: it remains remarkably fresh and fun. There's so much clever banter throughout between the two stars, it borders on comedy (so much we become oblivious to the scores of people we see killed during the story's unfolding). Its Oscar winning screenplay very much draws on actual people and events (but please see Wikipedia's article on Butch Cassidy for how closely the movie mirrors reality). The actual lives and activities of Butch & the Sundance Kid are almost over the top--and so is this movie, too.


                
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman. It stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross and Strother Martin. A Panavision/De Luxe production with music by Burt Bacharach and cinematography by Conrad Hall.Not exactly a hit with the critics of the time, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had no such problems at the box office or with longevity of popularity. It is still today one of the few Western films that none Western fans enjoy immensely. Much of this can be attributed to the wonderful buddy buddy chemistry between Newman and Redford, and of course the general blending of ragamuffin drama with cheeky chappy comedy.The casting as finished was not exactly set in stone, Newman was always in but was originally going to play the part of Sundance. McQueen was pencilled in for Cassidy, as was Lemmon while Beatty was mooted as well, but eventually a chance was taken on Redford and Newman switched to the role of Cassidy. On such things can a movie be made or broken, as it turned out it was the ace in the pack as infamously legendary characters were brought vividly to life.Only based on the basic real life facts of the Hole-in-the-Wall gang led by Butch Cassidy, the film follows the simple formula of two lovable rogue entrepreneurs being chased by a Pinkerton posse whilst robbing their way to a new life in Bolivia. A gorgeous sepia opening sets the standard for the visual treats to follow, with over a quarter of the film being an extended chase sequence through the landscapes. As Hill and Goldman (Academy Award Best Story/Screenplay) provide the tension in the sequences, Conrad Hall (Academy Award Best Cinematography) brings clarity of beauty that's blended with dust strewn sweat.The music by Burt Bacharach (Academy Award Best Music) has not always gone down well with critics and fans alike, especially the pivotal "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" (song by country singer B.J. Thomas). But in the context of the scenes, and the changing of the West (even the Western movie in fact), the music mostly works. Yes, "Raindrops" is a touch corny in essence, but the accompanying sequences as the bicycle replaces the horse for a major metaphor - and the warmth of the Etta Place (Ross a little bland) and Cassidy friendship is born out - it's hardly a film killer. In fact it's a daring move by the makers.Hugely influential on Westerns that would follow and spawning further tales of the exploits of Butch and Sundance, Hill's movie has well and truly earned its much loved reputation. With the constant by-play between Redford and Newman always engaging (who are those guys?), a number of iconic scenes firmly ensconced in movie folklore, and technical smarts to cherish, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid never takes its foot of the pedal or its grip on your heart. Because as the freeze frame sepia ending passes muster as a blaze of glory, it's indeed true that Hill, Hall, Goldman, Newman and Redford have made a true Western classic. 9/10


                
I can't believe this movie was made in 1969. But then I look at how YOUNG Newman and Redford are in the film and how craggy and 'well-seasoned' they look now and figure, yeah, that was a long time ago. The pairing of these two actors was brilliant; the chemistry between them, the way they can play off each other's strengths, was recaptured years later in The Sting. BC and the SDK starts of as a loopy set piece of two giddy train robbers just living from one holdup to the next one - but then they rob the wrong guy and he hires a world-class tracker ("Who ARE those guys?") who just won't give up. They keep running - all the way to Bolivia. And okay, maybe the bicycle scene in the meadow with Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head is schmaltzy - but didn't you love it? And don't you remember that scene every time you hear the song on the radio? A movie really doesn't get much better than this.


                
To tell the truth, there are very few western films that I actually see. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a rare exception. This film truly is not your average western. For one thing, the film does not revolve around good guys vs. bad guys the entire time. It's more of a story about Butch and Sundance themselves. The movie can be humorous at times, throwing in tons of little bits of intelligent verbal comedy, as most great films throughout time have been able to do. Robert Redford shows a side of brilliant acting with lines such as those in his "Can I move?" scene in which he cannot simply stand still and shoot his target. Paul Newman is also especially good, interjecting some wit and sarcasm that make this film so enjoyable. This movie also introduced "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head," one of the best original songs in movie history. Though I like Newman and Redford's second film together ("The Sting") even better, this is still a great film on its own. Perhaps it's only the film's ending that makes this movie less than perfect for me. Though it is more historically accurate, it does provide somewhat of a sense of disappointment here. Nevertheless, the rest of the film is nearly perfect, very enjoyable and worthwhile. A classic, and one of the best films of the 60s.***1/2 out of ****


                
The age-old question surrounding this movie is whether it is a comedy or a western.does it really matter?what does matter is a film that is well made,from the fine camera work from Conrad Hall,good direction by George Roy Hill,and charismatic performances by the two leads Paul Newman and Robert Redford.also great support by Strother Martin(bingo!),Kenneth Mars,and also Katherine Ross.it's still hard to believe that Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen were originally supposed to play the two outlaws.the only real problem i have is with the film's soundtrack which can seem a bit sugary for the subject.never mind-sit back and enjoy a marvelous piece of entertainment from a group of old pros.


                
In the 1950s and 1960s, adventure movies were often Westerns. In later years, they were just as often buddy movies. "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid" is kind of where one became the other. It's lasted because it's so good, and also because it did some things that were unusual at the time but became very customary soon after.It's funny to read the comments from people knocking this film as a form of praising "The Wild Bunch." They were both westerns made in 1969, and the main characters in both are outlaws, but there's not much else they have in common other than Strother Martin and Latinos dying in slo-mo. Disparaging "Butch Cassidy" because it's not "Wild Bunch" is like attacking "Star Wars" for not being "Gone With The Wind."I think "Wild Bunch" is great, too, but in a much different way, tough, mean, and brutal. "Butch Cassidy" is a sunny charmer, aimed squarely at the mainstream but with nice touches throughout that surprise you with their understated brilliance. The opening kinescope sequence; the sepia washing into the blue horizon as Butch and Sundance ride away from the card game; the still photograph section during the trip to New York, and especially the powerful last shot. There's nothing crazy or clever about the film, except when you realize it was designed to attract theater goers and did so despite taking so many chances within its conventional form.The music riles some. You can read them all here. "Bacharach and David were totally wrong for this type of movie, what's with all those 'Dating Game' tunes, I fast-forward through the bicycle part, etc." As Sundance would say of these criticisms: "Bitch, bitch, bitch!" "Butch Cassidy" works because it is anachronistic. It's not cinema verite, it's not trying to seem real for a second. The kinescope bit at the beginning is your clue, this is a western movie that's fully aware of its nature as a movie, and expects the same from the audience.That being said, I'd like to add that the bicycle sequence is my favorite part, because of the great song, the wordless interaction of Paul Newman and Katharine Ross, the way the sunlight dapples the lace curtains and the caramel locks of Etta's hair. It's also something else, too, the one moment of peace Butch gets and an oddly effective grace note in his otherwise miserable life. The look he gives the bull after crashing through the fence is not just cute but summarizes in one priceless instant Butch's approach to life's travails throughout the film.I used to think the chase part went on too long, but now I just sit back and enjoy the banter, and the gorgeous scenery. (I don't know where Conrad Hall shot this picture, but I have a hard time believing it was anywhere on Planet Earth.) Nothing else to complain about with this one, nothing.Obviously the most appealing aspect of this film are the two leads. Its a happy miracle that with all the big names being bandied around, we ended up with Newman and Robert Redford. Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen wouldn't have worked not because of inferior acting skills but inferior chemistry. Newman and Redford work so well with each other because they aren't competing but playing off each other. They are actors, and they have egos, but there's no stench of narcissism connected to this movie. That's why it's so enjoyable even through the slow stretches, and why it's a shame Newman and Redford only did one other movie together after this.George Roy Hill directed that movie, "The Sting," as well as this, and it's bewildering how little credit he seems to get for his work. Sure, he won an Oscar for "The Sting," and was nominated for one for this, but he's nearly forgotten today. Maybe it's because he was so versatile. Hill made "Slap Shot" and "The World Of Henry Orient;" two films as far apart as any in terms of demographic appeal. "Butch Cassidy" is one of the most inventive, successful mainstream films ever made, and it's inventive and successful because Hill was the man with the plan behind it.One other thing: If you like this movie but don't have this on DVD, get it. If you don't have a DVD player, it's worth having for the "Butch" DVD alone. It's a generously front-loaded item featuring gorgeous imaging, an informative commentary track, penetrating interviews with all the stars looking back, and most especially a documentary Hill narrated a year after the film came out which details the many challenges he confronted making this movie. Hill's final line in that documentary is a gem!


                
One of the all time great movies of not only the Western genre but of cinematic history. The time of the Western outlaw is coming to an end and while we see Butch & Sundance try and change their ways, they ultimately fall back on what they know best - bank robbery. The relentless pursuit of the law in America forces them to take flight to Bolivia where they are still forced to run.The playful back & forth between Newman & Redford as the titular Butch & Sundance often makes you forget the fact that these are two of the most wanted criminals in America at the time. This easily allows you to fall onto the side of the outlaws outrunning the law, rather than the typical lawman hunting the bank robber. The script is flawless and the timing of Newman & Redford is spectacular. Having them vying for the affections of Etta Place brings a more humane side to a pair who would have been labelled ruthless killers in America at the time. Their ultimate doom is well known by Old West history buffs but there is an overwhelming feeling that you want them to escape to Australia as they discussed. There are still reports that both lived on after their time in Bolivia but the final scene a fitting way to send off two of the most notorious outlaws of their time.
How is it possible that when people hear the word 'western' they immediately think of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Well, there are exactly THAT many reasons for this interesting phenomena. Firstly, the stunning directing by George Robert Hill makes it look like an exactly archetypal movie in this specific category. It easily became a smash hit at the box-office in the United States in 1969 and went on to create a major fan base all over the world.Secondly, it offers a spellbinding storyline provided by the great William Goldman. It's packed with everything that can be connected with this most American of all genres: genuine characters, grand wild west feeling, gunfights, train robberies, pretty dames, dangerous enemies, gangs, chases, great adventures, a little romance, a little comedy, etc. Additionally, all the clever dialogues make the movie much more pleasurable and engaging.Thirdly, the cinematography is really incredible, offering the most captivating views of Western American and Bolivian landscapes, which the viewer is able to admire right from the beginning up till the very end. Also, the fantastic shifts in takes from sepia to color in some of the most climatic scenes create a perfect atmosphere.Fourthly, I believe that I didn't mention the two stars, the most memorable couple of gunslingers, train robbers and lawbreakers that ever roamed through the vast American desserts – Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). Based on a real-life pair of criminals, their story is partly true and partly imagined. On the run from the law, the boys decide to hide in Bolivia and start a new career there. Along comes Etta Place (Katharine Ross), Kid's girlfriend. They try to learn Spanish in order to be able to rob banks, but what comes out of this farce looks more like a comedy than serious business. After a series of successes and some misfortunes, they are finally wanted all over the country, like they were in their homeland. In the most gripping, and unforgettable final scene they have to fight with tens of policemen and even though the viewers knows that they are criminal and, thus, should be caught or killed, the way they are portrayed makes it easy to admire those two up-to-no-good characters.Surprisingly, the scene, which stayed in my memory for the longest time, wasn't this one or any other of the fast-action sort – it was the one when Butch was riding on a bike with Etta (accompanied by a beautiful song 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'), like they were two innocent kids, strolling around farms, as if nothing really mattered.All of those factors make this movie look special. I won't be original when I say that this is probably one of my favorite western of them all, but that's the truth. No one can deny that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kind will go down in history as one of the finest, most entertaining, and most achieved movies ever.


                
Many memorable scenes from the first to the iconic last, a great soundtrack, and three outstanding performances from Redford, Newman and Ross make this a film well worth investing your time in.


                
This has got to be one of my favorite westerns. It has everything you could possibly want, The acting was a perfect from Redford and Newman, The writing was great and creative The directing by George Roy Hill was as well amazing... So, when you combine all the elements, you got yourself a Western Masterpiece.


                
Un langage cinématographique innovant, ingénieux et original ce qui en fait un western unique et savoureux sur trame d'histoire véridique. Cette narration particulière nous entraîne avec un célèbre couple de hors la loi et surtout à travers leur amitié. Leur destinée est commune. Le ton et l'ingéniosité du film, l'agréable narration, la réalité romancée des faits nous rend particulièrement intime avec les personnages principaux. Sentiment confirmé par la présence de leur fidèle amie Etta. Le trio ainsi formé est touchant mais hélas rattrapé par la réalité consciente de la vie et de la société dans laquelle il vive, notamment pour Etta.Katharine Moss nous offre, malgré la résignation et les désillusions de sa vie, une fraîche et savoureuse Etta. Le duo Robert Redford Paul Newman est rapidement fort à l'écran bien que l'on sent qu'il a dû avoir une courte période d'observation, de mise en place du couple ainsi formé.Cette équipe artistique et technique prendra toute sa maturité dans leur chef d'<U+009C>uvre suivant « l'arnaque ».


                
When you see a film like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid a sad thought springs to mind and that is "Isn't age a horrible thing " I have just watched Road to Perdition which stars Paul Newman and when you see how fantastic he looks in This film to how old he looks in the latter it is a terrible shame . Redford and Newman are a fantastic double act and look as good as anybody ever has in cinema in this movie. I wouldn't say the film is fantastic in itself but what does make it a classic is the cinematography , the funny script (not the actual story) and the two lead actors. It does make me wonder why in their later years Robert Redford and Paul Newman have kept their film appearances down to a minimum and why they haven't done a film together since the 70's. I'm not sure if they fell out but one thing is for sure the chemistry they produced together in this film is a rare thing indeed. 9 out of 10.


                
I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. I don't usually like western-type movies, but this one actually did. This movie was released in 1969, so I was expecting parts of it to be boring, there weren't any parts where I lost interest. I thought it was shot really well and the intense zoom-ins made it even more amusing. I especially liked the witty dialogue between the two which added to the characters. It' s cool to see actors I know now when they were younger. The montages throughout the film were also great along with the soundtrack (which is full of bops). The only thing I would question is the ending because I've heard many different things about how the two died.
The beginning of the film can seem forever and doesn't really have any interest, however it starts to pick up when Butch Cassidy fights with one of his gang members. Overall it was a pretty cool film, before i watched this i didn't know about Butch Cassidy and the sundance kid.
Now I have watched this film before, but it doesn't change the fact at still how great it is! The story line and the dialogue is a huge part of this movie, and its probably one of its best features. There are so many funny and great lines in this movie, they add to the completion of the film so well.
Visuals are excellent for the time period. The film is good and colorful considering it was shot in 1969. The costumes, the settings, and the props are all great and add so much depth to the experience.
Considering all of these things put together, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a classic, and a great one at that! I strongly recommend you watch this


                
This is one of the best wild west movies that I have seen as they out many witty and funny lines into this movie portrayed perfectly by Paul Newman and Robert Redford their performances were very well performed and they many thing in this movie that were very unexpected back in the seventy's and made me and others that watch the movie have a good experience as the only part i have i gripe with is with how loosely the story is tied together but i work perfectly fine when the movie is about the characters and not the story.This is very good wild west movie that if your a fan of wild west movies you should see this movie.


                
I found this movie entertaining. It was very action filled. I was just a little bit confused about some of the events that happened. Such as them trading off with the girl. Like one day she was riding on the handlebars of Butch's bicycle. Then the next, she's sharing a bed with the sundance kid. I think it was a really cool movie, considering how old it is. There were many witty moments.


                
This gets one star short of perfection for one minor thing: it is a product of its time with bouncy music montage sequences, really no full plot, and being the epitome of a popcorn picture that is aimed to please, and does. It's the anti-Bonnie and Clyde bandit film, certainly low key in its violence and often tongue in cheek funny. You can't help but love the two stars (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) and root for their characters, two train bandits who manage to charm and influence their victims, charming them in an "Ah shucks" sort of way, and influencing them to follow the two way down south to Bolivia. Accompanying them is prim and proper school marm Katharine Ross who aids them in learning Spanish to get away with a string of clever but comical robberies which doesn't seem to be leading to the ultimate "Sting".There are many classic moments in this practically excellent action comedy, half western and half southern. Newman doing bike tricks for Ross, the two men stranded on a cliff over the Colorado River, and the final shootout, all used in film montages over the years. There's great character roles for many veteran faces, unknown by name (Percy Helton and Jody Gilbert for example), and a few actors in early appearances or roles before they were stars. There may not be raindrops falling on their head, but there will be smiles on your face as you root for these lovable scoundrels. Under the direction of George Roy Hill, this is near perfection.
When it comes to westerns, generally they were made in the late 1940s up until somewhat early 1960s. However this film came out in the end of the 1960s (1969). This genre was around for a long time and at this point it may have even been dying out. There were many great westerns made before this, yet this is one of the best ones out there. Great action to it, great story to it, and the actors are just phenomenal. As you watch the film, you feel like you're in the wild west with these guys shooting around and chasing down the people. Truly a great film. Would recommend to any western movie genre fan.
