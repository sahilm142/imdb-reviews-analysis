 a crime against SUBTLE-T

 Am I the Only One?

 Everything about this film is synthetic

 Check your Brain at the Door

 Over rated tripe

 What happened Pixar?

 Just Plain Not Good

 It was totally Boring and no Fun

 No words

 Why is everyone drooling over this film

 Pathetic political cartoon...

 If you love someone big, skip it! California fat-phobic self-righteousness

 A superficial film for superficial people.

 Something might be wrong with me, but this is not my cup of tea.

 Awful movie- nothing more

 A complete waste of money, and talent.

 Worst animated film ever!

 I don't get it

 sucks unless your 10 years old

 People please... get real

 A shame that voting doesn't extend to negative integers

 Wall-E was Horribl-E

 Nobody is perfect and Pixar is definitely not a nobody....

 No cars

 One of the worst cartoon features ever!
