I could not believe I spent over 2 hours watching this film.  Although the premise/storyline was good, execution was horridly lame, slow, tedious, and boring.Kanji, the "hero" of the story, whined way too much, mumbled too much, and failed to capture the emotions of the moment.Watching him speak or attempt to display emotion reminded me way too much of that sequel to "Star Trek, the movie" wherein we were tortured by having to witness this ever so slow "fly-by" of the new Enterprise.Ikiru would have been much better had the producers trimmed 45 minutes from the film.


                
Over 3 hours of sheer boredom, with elderly Japanese guys mumbling every line that comes out of their mouth. It was hard to tell who the main character was at times. The cinematography was absolutely awful and the old Japanese men are simply not interesting to enough to make a 3 hour movie about. How am I supposed to connect with the characters when I can't even understand what they are saying? even with the subtitles on it was impossible most of the time. The story is about a guy who lives a boring life, well the director sure managed to project that onto the presentation of the film. Hands down one of the slowest moving films ever made, this crap was made in 1952. maybe people then found enjoyment in this tedious wreck.
