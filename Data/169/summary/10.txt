 A War Like All Wars A Film Like No Other

 A veteran's impression of "The Deer Hunter"

 It was 1978 and everyone in the audience was about to wet their pants

 It's about character development

 The Deer Hunter is a masterful piece of cinema

 It's been given a fairly bad reputation over the years - undeservedly so, too. One of the greatest films ever made.

 Immense poignancy

 As great as ever

 The Deer Hunter: 10/10

 to call it masterpiece is to state the obvious

 The Best Film Ever made about War

 How far would you go for a friend?

 the most potent drama I have ever seen

 Diddy Mao!

 Stunning

 The Deer Hunter is one of the most powerful and dramatic war films ever.

 The most emotionally shattering Vietnam War movie ever made!

 A Potent Anti-War Film

 ..a realistic story of what war does to men..

 One of the best movies of the 70s.....

 Forgot what an incredible film this is

 How A Foreign Game Killed Us All

 The Other Side of Vietnam: What Apocalypse and Platoon didn't show us.

 Whatever its political and historical flaws, it's too realistic dramatic to be ignored. Amazing.

 One Of The Best Movies Ever Made!
