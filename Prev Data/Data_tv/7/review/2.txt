I'm one of David Attenborough's greatest fans. His six decades plus of experience in bringing nature into our homes is overwhelming. However, this documentary series is stretching the limit on animation. Yes, it saves great sums of money to dub every scene with what might really happen in the wild, but I'd much rather stay closer to reality.Sorry, David. I can't give this more than a 2, despite the excellent message. Nature documentaries should be real.
