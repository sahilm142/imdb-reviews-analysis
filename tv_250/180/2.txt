Anyone saying this was a above 3/10 was either payed or edited!The show introduced a similar concept to Steins gate where the protagonist is able to change the future. However, this story has more focus on an event that happens in the past. Ever wondered what you would do as your 10 year old self if you had all the knowledge you have now? This series delves into that. It really had something going until it was going to reveal the bad guy. The series continuously laid out obvous hints on who the bad one was, which is why it really shouldn't be that person... which it was. From there it was just a matter of lack of excitement. The "thrill" when it comes to the fight between the protagonist and the antagonist was just so freaking bad I wanted to grab the nearest knife and commit sepukku. And it was just so disappointing to learn that the killer was nothing but an unrelatable psychopath.


                
There wasn't much flow on this, it just didn't get me into it like we only just see a Fed up 20 something year old guy and the fact he's wishing to go back in time to save his mother from the kidnappers who killed her. I mean yeah, that part is very sad but I felt there should've been at least more emotion involved in the character. The character just seems irritating and not bothered which is dissapointing for an anime that's considered good. I didn't find it good, I found it boring...
