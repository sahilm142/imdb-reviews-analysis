 The Movie Not Married

 Before Sunrise

 Before Sunrise: 7/10

 A Doddle of a Movie at Ease

 Come on people

 A romance film with a thinking brain

 Vienna we love.

 It's important with whom we see a movie

 The start of a great romance trilogy

 More a realistic look at romantic relationships than a good romantic tale.

 Thought provoking conversations

 moments gone by...

 Before Sunrise

 Before Sunrise - Spoiler Warning

 my thoughts

 The best film you're likely to find with the most basic of plots and fewest characters

 Romanticism and philosophy.

 Funny, Real, Romantic yet tragic

 Not all that great

 Fresh, non-formula Hollywood-goes-to-Vienna romantic lite-drama

 "You need resign yourself to the awkwardness of life."
