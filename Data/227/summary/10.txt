 Perhaps the most relevant social commentary on U.S society ever put on screen.

 You can't watch it only once

 Stunning.

 Great movie

 You can't just forget a film like Donnie Darko and that's a compliment

 I'm writing the 1889th comment on Donnie Darko here. When it hits 1988th comment, the world will come to an end; as Frank told me.

 Best movie, I've ever seen

 Dynamic Darko!

 Are you ready for something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT? Donnie Darko.

 Amazing

 this is how minds become bent

 Incredible film - an enigmatic treat that throws up more possibilities each time you watch it.

 Good film, annoying reviewers

 A Thought-Provoking Modern Masterpiece

 one of the best films of this decade so far

 Overrated film waste of 2 hours.

 Frustrating. Inaccessible. But brilliant!

 mad world , possibilities

 I'm not clever enough to figure it out but........

 ***fantastic - great film***

 Unforgettable!

 Darko Indeed!

 One of the greatest cinematic achievements

 My favorite film
