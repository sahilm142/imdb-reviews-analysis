 Read "Hated it" reviews before watching

 A waste of time and money

 Appalling

 This Movie Was A Bad Joke About WWII

 Self indulgent and reliant on reputation

 Tarantino's "Talking At Tables"

 More junk from Tarantino

 Terrible Waste of Money & Time!

 Fiasco

 frankly, if it wasn't for Tarentino ...

 What is the world coming to?!

 Don't pay to watch this, don't buy the DVD, and wait till you find it at a garage sale for 10 cents.

 Very disappointing

 Inglourious Basterds waste of time film and my money

 Un-glorious Mastrubation

 More Homage-frais from a tired director

 Worst movie I've seen in a long time - AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!!!

 I don't know WHAT this film was supposed to be

 A travesty riding on the (ill-gotten) reputation of a hack-director.

 "I don't suppose you'll mind if I go out speaking the King's."

 Top ten worst movies I ever saw

 Inglorious Failure

 Tarentino indulges himself at our expense

 This movie is actually not worth a comment. but here goes.

 Unbelievably Bad
