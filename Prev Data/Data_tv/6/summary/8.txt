 Deserve Ain't Got Nothing To Do With It

 Meaty and realistic depiction of drug-related pain spots in a US metropolis

 Not your average TV drama - This is hard-hitting critique on society.

 May be a 10 back in the day, but not in 2018 (watched from season 1 to 5)

 A Strong Show, which Fails to Deliver the Final Blow

 One of the best shows ever !!
