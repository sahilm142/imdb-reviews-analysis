 The myth of "genius"

 and now, ABC After school special presents.

 Cliched, unreal, predictable and manipulative

 Not So Good Will Hunting

 Not all that

 Unbearable !

 Can you say "hype"?

 Like maple syrup

 No, Bad

 Genius doesn't know how to mop a floor

 no hope for Hollywood

 One of the worst

 Do they know any words with more than four letters?

 um mm ewe

 awful

 Sleepy, anyone?

 If I hear the word *uck one more time!

 Utter tosh

 Hmm, like MF?

 HOW did this thing ever make money???

 Detestable film about the strange people with brains.

 Not Bad

 Good Will Hunting is simply one of the best films I've ever seen!

 Where's the pizazz?

 Uninspired and full of cliché
