I didn't like the film i thought it was drawn out way to long at the end when you already knew what was going to happen. Im not big on musicals though i thought the artistic aspect of the film was very cool. As well as the ability of the main character to act and dance. I liked how the film used colors as well certain scenes were very vibrant with colors to set the mood while others had a lot of grey in them. I thought the setup for the film was amazing though as well as the editingt. The scenes were immensely large and abstract. Though i don't like musicals i thought a lot of the film was interesting even though i didn't like the music there is a lot of visuals in the film i found to be cool.


                
I'll say it. I do not like musicals. Ever since i was little i always found them hard to sit through and watch. Its not that i don't like music because i like music of all sorts from any decade or genre but everything about musicals i cannot stand. The acting in this one ill be honest wasn't too bad and some things made me laugh a bit but i can't help but find myself a little annoyed while watching this movie. This is just my opinion though because a lot of people think this was a good movie, they're not wrong i just did not like it. But that doesn't mean i didn't think it was a good movie (if that makes any sense.) Like while i was watching i didn't like it but i could still see why people like it. There was just so much damn dancing in this movie and singing and besides the 3 main characters i found most of the cast annoying or boring to watch. But again, this is just my opinion.
