 Well done for a pilot episode!

 I've underestimated this show.

 What a great show!

 Great show... except for the daughter

 LAST SEASON

 Gripping like an iron fist

 Chalk up another remarkable show for FX.

 Intelligent spy drama

 Sexy isn't the word I would use....

 Small things I can't overlook

 if it took place today

 Very good -- but...

 Very good

 (spoiler alert) I liked the 1st episode save for....

 excellent !

 A cut above the rest

 The good gals lost

 Annoying Paige!

 Solid and realistic Cold War narration

 I like the show, just not the daughter.

 I'm binge watching this one

 Great show........however...

 Just starting to watch this see below

 Correction....
