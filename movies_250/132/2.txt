I know lots of people that really like these kind of films but unfortunately I just can't get invested into it unfortunately


                
What makes a movie? Even more than plot? It's characters. Kiwi is an anime movie worth a 10 for her charm (even if she's not perfect). The characters here were simply charmless. With people boasting about this being the best, I was hoping for something as least half as good as the already mentioned movie by the same publisher. With plain dull characters, this pedestrian movie simply didn't give me anybody worth caring about to watch. And nothing can cure that. And no, I didn't bother watching until the end.
