 for god's sake, you are supposed to be the romantic..

 Doesn't fully fulfill its promising premise

 I can see what they are doing with the film and I can actually appreciate it

 Between nonsense and true art...

 Just Who Is Being Satirized in Network?

 Too Much Pontificating

 Still relevant today (almost)

 A generation ruined, allegedly

 Classic political film

 Timeless

 The truth of today...

 Network (3/5 stars)

 disappointed

 Insightful but second half weirdly uncomfortable

 Howard Beale Show

 Sprawling, flawed masterpiece

 a very good criticism of media and the capitalist system in general

 Interesting but overrated

 Stagey and longish, but altogether well-made and beautifully acted

 dated but memorable

 Disappointed.

 Amazing film, but some aspects dated

 A Product Of Its Era And Therefore Dated

 very bleak,but thought provoking,and ahead of its time

 Network
