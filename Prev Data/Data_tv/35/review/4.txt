My first impressions of this movie were "This was really great". The reasons for that would be the beautiful looking outdoors and the inclusion of Mr.Darcy's point of view in different aspects of the story. Any fan would love that because of being a BIG Fan of Darcy the Character and "Colin Firth". Thats why I enjoyed it a lot.But as I looked more closely, the environment of this movie takes me far from the Jane Austen's World. My first comment would be on Mr Darcy's adaptation by Colin Firth. Darcy was not a nice and humble person. He was STIFF and proud. Many people are disgusted by David Rintoul's representation of Darcy-- who has truly captured the essence of the character.Also Jennifer Ehle in being satirical has lost the playful & thoughtful (both at the same-time) aspects of Elizabeth's personality. Elizabeth Garvie makes you understand Elizabeth Bennet more closely and truly as Austen's Elizabeth.Other characters which include "Mr Collins", Mrs Bennet, Lady Catherine and Lydia are exaggerations of their Novel selves disturbing the mood of the movie quite often.If there is a character which is perfectly casted and craved in this version of P& P. Its Ms Bingley. She does a great job. Neither short of , nor more than whats in Novel.Onthe whole the movie loses big time in Casting and characterization.The plus points of the movie come from director's own vision of things. For example he shows Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy riding into the community in first scene. some gazes between Mr Darcy and Lizzie are very creatively done and are a fresh air which do not disturb the soul of "Pride and Prejudice".I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. But its not the one I will watch over and over again. The movie that always stays in VCR is the one made in 1980.
