 Totally Undeserving of its Praise

 Cartoonish, not Dramatic

 Worth watching if you can shut off your brain.

 "I'll do him if you do me"

 Complete garbage

 An All Around Subpar Show

 does not deserve a high ranking

 This Is A Freak Show, Absurd, Implausible & Disgusting

 the show follows Jax Tellier as he takes the lead of his father's bikers gang while trying to raise his newborn son.

 Deeply disappointed

 Ride......off a cliff.

 a dead set joke

 Terrible, full of empty bravado, posturing and clichés

 Soap Opera

 Fat dumpy prospect

 I Tried to Like This Show

 Almost

 It really sucks ....
