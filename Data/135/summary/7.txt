 Terrific Miyazaki, although not his best

 Somewhat disappointing

 howl's moving castle

 My Personal disappointment

 DEFINITELY A GHIBLI FILM

 I am one of those disappointed Miyazaki fans

 Beautifully animated

 Not the best Ghibli offering, but certainly worth watching.

 Howl's Moving Castle

 interesting world

 An inspired expansion on an already classic tale.

 Although certainly miles ahead of the average cartoon around these days, this is not the best Miyazaki.

 Howl's Moving Castle

 Good in itself, but not if you're looking for a repeat of the book

 good but not great

 Good fun, Miyazaki fans won't be disappointed.

 such beautiful artistry

 Good if flawed

 I Actually Rather Liked This

 "A Heart Is A Heavy Burden"

 Nice anime movie...

 Valuable Lessons, Beautifully Told

 I bet you'll say ''ummm...'' after you watch it

 Beautifully animated... Worth a look!...

 Complicated and inventive fantasy...
