 Fantastic

 An American Masterpiece: The Single Greatest Narrative of Our Generation

 This isn't just a show about crime - this tries to show every aspect of life in a crumbling society

 The best show ever made

 Best show on TV

 Television at its peak, seminal work

 The best thing on TV today

 Ahead of its time

 best show ever, owns nypd blues, the shield and so on...

 As Close as it Gets

 Like a great novel

 If You Haven't Seen this show, but are considering it, please read my review.

 Simply amazing in every sense

 Filling the void,and then some!

 Consider it more of a TV "book" than a TV "show".

 The greatest thing put on film

 Captivating storyline with too many great dramatic performances to mention

 Great acting, great story, great directing, great SHOW! - Must see....

 Great story, superb acting, perfect casting, and top notch directing.

 One Of HBO's Best

 Puts most, if not all, gangster movies to shame

 The Wire has ruined TV for me.

 Most well thought out show I have seen

 The Absolute Greatest Crime Drama on Television

 NOTHING comes close
