 An immortal and towering achievement

 An epic movie in every meaning of the word

 Overlong, overrated, but OK

 WHAT A LOONY

 Definitely deserves the title of a "classic"

 A Film of War Produced During Anxious Times

 The brilliant Vivien Leigh made me so angry!!

 Every bit the classic

 The Epic and The Soap Opera...

 Frankly dear, I don't give a damn? No, actually we all do.

 This story takes place during the civil war and follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara who falls in love with Rhett Butler.

 Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara's spoiled life is flipped from the Civil War. Reality develops her into a strong woman, she loses all but her optimism and determination.

 GONE WITH THE WIND hasn't gone with time

 The film that set the standard for grandeur...

 The wind done gone

 One of the Most Complicated Films Ever

 " After Tara, there is little room in your heart for anything else, is there Scarlett? "

 The 1st movie to 'go Green'; having Recycled the Great Wall from "KING KONG" as part of the fire in the Burning of Atlanta.

 "It's an historic moment you can tell your grandchildren about - how you watched the Old South fall one night."

 A nation, and a woman, struggle to grow up

 Masterful epic

 BlockBuster Before Filming Began

 Wonderful portrayal of a couple of people who refuse to be happy...

 A gorgeous Technicolor epic that has stood the test of time

 I actually enjoyed this
