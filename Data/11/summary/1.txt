 A painful mutilation of the greatest piece of fantasy literature.

 Brilliant? No. Sadly "Hollywood".

 Atrocious from beginning to end (SPOILERS)

 A nightmare for a Tolkien fan who read the book in the '60s

 Whats all the hype?????????

 Imagine the Mummy with delusions of Grandeur.(spoilers)

 Lord Of The Rings: The most overrated movie since the beginning of time. (Lazy Review <U+0096> Some Spoilers)

 A dire three hour film about walking

 crap.. what absolute crap

 Uninteresting

 ten pounds of ---- in a five pound bag

 Really Bad

 A pooch of the highest (lowest?) order.

 In a word, this movie SUCKED!

 people who really "get" Tolkien will not admire this film

 Big and boring

 Over-rated boring movie!

 Overrated Film of the Century (already!)

 Oh, dear. Could it have been any worse?

 Dammit! Demand more from film people!

 Is there something I missed....

 big disappointment

 unvisionary, mainly boring and uncareful made

 Don't tell me to read the book. I shouldn't have to...

 Pathetic.
