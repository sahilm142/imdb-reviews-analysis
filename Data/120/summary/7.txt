 Distanced and sober view of Hitler's last days

 Powerful Stuff

 The Stage Under Das Boot

 Important and controversial

 A good movie, but way too long.

 Good but could have been better

 A film that makes you think

 Chilling

 good but not great

 Why the build up?

 Interesting Perspective

 Not too sure about this one

 Very good but doesn't impact

 Ambivalent?

 Downfall disappoints in not finding a positive character

 Effective drama, grave and shocking

 Good acting but perhaps a bit too soft on Hitler

 Great movie

 Nice elaboration on the final days of the Fuhrer

 well acted but hard to watch

 Ganz is the star, not the endless supporting cast

 Very authentic story of Hitler and the End of the third Reich
