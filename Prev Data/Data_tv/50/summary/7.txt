 Disappointing Drivel

 jumped the shark in season 5

 Season 5

 All seasons with Kevin Spacey and without...

 THE WORST FINAL SEASON & FINALE OF ALL TIME!

 Great Show for first 2 seasons...fell off on 3rd season.

 I feel simply sad...

 Stood firm for four seasons, collapsed completely in Season 5

 ..the ultimate legacy of the show rests on S6..

 S5 - Or How The Show Jumped The Shark (too much)

 Season 3: a very long pilot to season 4

 Overrated, but not bad

 Excellent and then disappointing

 Season 1-4 (10/10)

 Why, but why you had to spoil the last season so badly???

 The first season is a 9. . .

 Almost there

 Remake of a masterpiece.

 Hated it

 Enjoyable beltway fantasy

 We could have been better without season 6

 As a Whole

 Great series, but a little repetitive.

 House of Ridiculous Plot Devices
