 A true 'hollywood classic'

 The most over-rated movie since Shakespeare In Love

 Terrible movie in many ways

 No, It Doesn't Work

 Completely OVERRATED, and often cliché!

 Sucker Punch!

 Eastwood's Worst Film yet

 Boss Boss, De Plane , De Plane

 IMDb'ers Restoreth My Soul!

 two separate movies connected to each other BADLY (SPOILER, the only one in the movie)

 Highly over-rated movie because it is poorly understood

 Hollywood Failure

 Extremely depressing

 Best Picture? More Like BS Picture!

 such a love or hate movie

 horrible

 Over glorified euthanasia

 Give me a break! this movie is for Sado-Masochism purposes only!

 Sorry, it just didn't do it for me ...

 Vastly overrated celebration of dysfunction and despair

 Doesn't make a good movie

 What a disaster!

 Clint still hates the disabled

 Depends on whether you want a good or bad ending

 I understood the nature of Clint Eastwood and will not go to any other his movies.
