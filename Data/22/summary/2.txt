 I never understood the hype.

 This might just be the end of my film critics career, but I gotta say, this movie sucks

 Awful. Worst Movie Ever Produced.

 It is a awful movie.

 what a joke

 this movie was teribel

 It's all because of Jimmy Carter and his peanuts

 Not as good as people say it is.
