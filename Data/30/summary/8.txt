 "I take no pleasure in taking life..."

 It's a shame.

 never WANTED to comment BUT Had TO

 Great film with one of the most memorable duos in film history

 Luc Besson style of violent action

 MY REVIEW: Intelligent, Emotional and Intense!!

 Classic for a reason

 Fantastic movie...

 Outstanding..!! Tragic, Brilliant and Thrilling...

 besson and reno at its best?

 10 outta 10

 Luc Besson at hist best !!!

 Would say it's one of the best. But it is still damn good

 Léon Still Rules the Mob

 The film that revealed Natalie Portman

 Léon is someone you really don't want to mess with.

 Wonderfully offbeat film!

 Excellent

 Leon

 The beauty incorrect

 I guess I expected a cheap actioner, but this offered much more

 A great action film with characters which I greatly cared for

 A Masterpiece of an Action/Drama Film Perfectly Executed

 Love

 One of the more unique crime thrillers.
