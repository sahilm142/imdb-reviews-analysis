The movie released today after a lot of hype and controversies. I went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the Indian film industry (of which I am not a fan). What I got was something so very different from what I had envisioned. The humor,the clichés, the nonchalance of youth, the culture, religion,politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. The storyline though is stretched a bit (we Indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. While this movie is definitely not Kurasawa or Satyajit Ray, it is one of the few movies from India which I feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. A movie not to be missed.


                
It's about time there has been a Bollywood film about the youth of India. Granted these are college kids and not the average Indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education for work, they are a good representatives of young Indians both in the diaspora and in India.Casting is great. Each character pursues their emotion, when their emotions are pursued by circumstances. They express both the emotions at surface and those sunken to be brought out by a situational tide. And they do it with truthfulness. Although some of the elder cast could have been utilized more, the focus on the youth and parallels with past figures are well orchestrated. The character that plays Bhagat Singh, Amir Khan, and Sonia are incredible. Each has their own spotlight where they nudge us from complacency and create an unstable sense of urgency.This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen, this movie has shown the progress of film- making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events, but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words, dialogue, and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camera-work that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because, chops or not, these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience.AR Rahman's music captures the reality unbelievably. We have dance numbers, but they're pathetic belligerent kicking and hand waving. Isn't that what we usually do when we're drunk anyways? Although the use of the music is off sometimes and abrupt, the emotion that each peace carries relates so well to the circumstances. The best use, in my opinion, being Luka Chuppi by Lata M and AR Rahman. The symbiosis between the lyrics and the events on screen are incredible. Dramatic irony at it's best.The cinematography of this film is great in the majority of the film. The few annoyances in cinematography come with the patchy scenes with the first half during these "leisure" rides and early in the second half. But, besides that - the cinematographer and director have made outstanding use of the diagonal view. The lines and profiles of people and country are so well placed that you begin to understand how crooked life's path can be. None of us have a straight line ahead of us. What makes me enjoy the movie the most is the humor and cause. You'd think with all the aforementioned details that this is a sobering movie about crooked lives and emotions and such, but the characters have fun. Sue's project is hilarious and the use of extras was really earnest. It is very much how I would be acting with friends, of course only when drunk like they are in certain parts. The cause is very important to this film and it makes it a powerful film because it has this cause.I'm 22. I just recently visited India. I understood and was confused by the youth of India and this film portrays the ambiguity of India well. There are no answers, there are only actions. And this is what they strive to do in the film. Usually Bollywood movies lose their purpose come the 1st dance number, but the truth of this film speaks more than numbers. It is a film about what comes after pure, white innocence of our youth. And it asks that we paint the difference.


                
If I wait any more to say all the things I want to say about this great soul-stirring movie I will never be able to say it.It is the best use of the film medium that I have seen in a long long time.Here in the west we have virtually abandoned good cinema.Where are our Capras,our Wilders, our Hitchcocks, our David Leans? We make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten.To put it very bluntly, we make utter trash.Good work in the world is being done elsewhere, especially in India where a Bhansali stretches the limits of cinematic expression, where a new Wilder emerges in the shape of Anees Bazmee, where Shaad Ali springs a surprise with a Bunty Aur Bubbly,where out of nowhere comes a Guru Dutt in the garb of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and takes us to a new level of awareness and self-discovery through cinema in a stunning masterpiece called Rang De Basanti.I challenge anyone to name a film made anywhere in the last fifteen years or so to hold a candle to this one.It is simply awesome.As an entertainer it is superb, as purposeful film it goes even further.As a fearless, bold crusader for just causes it is beyond compare.The whole team deserves to be congratulated.Apart from the tremendous contribution made by the writers and the director of the movie, the people who need to be singled out and applauded for the high quality of their work are Aamir Khan(his best role yet),Soha Ali Khan(who finally claims our attention with this role and is destined to be as distinguished as her mother Sharmila Tagore). Waheeda Rehman makes you feel that Guru Dutt is back directing her from heaven.Kirron Kher who is improving with every picture.And all the boys from Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni.All have turned in amazing performances.After Devdas and Munna Bhai MBBS, Binod Pradhan has once again shown that as an ace cameraman he is second to none.And what can you say about A.R. Rahman?This time he even sings like a pro.He is paired here for the first time with Prasoon Joshi who makes you think of Majrooh Sultanpuri.But before I forget, I must mention Alice Patten. She is a joy to behold.And she makes a great pair with Aamir.The film does not have a single dull moment in it.It can be repeated again and again with increasing returns to the viewer.It is a crossover film and needs to be seen by every one in the world.Its publicity and promotion should be geared to that.It should be sent to every international film festival in the world and should be India's entry to the Oscars this year.


                
Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.It would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.The balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.The movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace


                
Film ReviewRang De BasantiIndia AwakensBy Nidhi KathuriaRating *****'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go', this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a cliché patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career's best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What 'Mangal Pandey' couldn't do for Aamir Khan, 'Rang De Basanti' does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn't have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her 'pucca Punjaban' character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called 'Young Guns of India' based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled 'Rang De Basanti'. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of 'Mangal Pandey' completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that's what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours' souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.The Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia's fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. Rating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding


                
I have watched this movie today on the Republic Day of India, and I was really left speechless with the movie. It ranks among the very best movies. The movie has brought out the best performance from each actor. The movie has a very realistic look to it. And to add to the credits for the movie, the direction and the camera angles are simply mind-blowing. I don't think anybody will be satisfied with watching the movie just once. I think the movie is simply EXCELLENT. All those of you who haven't watched it, please do so. The topic that the movie covers is very much relevant and is something that is going on these days in our country.


                
Warning: This is not a movie for he faint hearted or for escapists looking for brainless entertainment.But if you belong to neither of those categories then this one's for you. As a viewer, I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Sure Aamkir Khan was known for quality cinema and all but Mangal Pandey had come as a huge disappointment and I was thinking that this would follow the same lines. Thankfully, I was wrong.One of the most different movies ever seen on the Indian Screen, it is a novel experience for the average moviegoer. One cannot really categorize this movie as Action or Romance or Patriotic etc. However, it falls under one category perfectly: Cult. This movie is sure to achieve Cult status especially among the youth. It has scenes from the lives of Bhagat Singh and other Revolutionaries (the sepia tone give it a really authentic feel) as well as the state of the current youth. But what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes a successful comparative study between the Incidents and Events in the Lives of our Pre-Independence Heroes and the Lives of the Modern Youth of India. As this comparison is brought out (especially in the Post-Interval Portions), it makes your skin crawl. Also the climax is an exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions. The Story: Sue (Alice Patton in an extremely commendable role) is a British girl who wants to make a movie on Indian Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad on the basis of the experiences of her grandfather who was an Officer in British India. Due to shortage of money she convinces a mix bag of college students and slackers to act in her movie (Aamir, Siddharth, Sharman Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor. While making the movie, she becomes good friends with them and even gets smitten with D.J. (Aamir).Now these guys have a friend who is an Air Force Pilot (R. Madhavan) whose MiG crashes due to its faulty parts. The entire group is devastated. What angers them further is the Defence Minister's (Mohan Agashe) accusation that the pilot was an amateur. But what really pushes them to the edge is when the Police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man, woman or child. They decide to take revenge....By killing the Defence Minister. When they succeed in their endeavour, they are shocked to find the Minister being called a Martyr ad being awarded the Bharat Ratna. They decide tat the country needs to know the truth. For this, they take over an All India Radio Station to announce the truth over the radio. What follows is the tense climax that keeps the viewers guessing till the very end.Analysis: The movie has been treated in a very contemporary manner. The dialogues have been penned beautifully. The script is tight. If the first half is filled with light moments then the second half has its share serious scenes. The Punjabi Dialogues come as a breath of fresh air.Apart from the main story, there are a number of sub-plots that are included that raise many issues. Be it the views of a Hindu Fundamentalist about Muslims or the views of a Muslim of the treatment given to his community in the country, it makes the viewer think. There is also the love story between Soha Ali Khan and R. Madhavan as well as the controversy regarding the faulty parts in the MiG airplanes purchased by India and the money made by selfish industrialist (Anupam Kher...wasted) and Ministers. The Music is Excellent. After a hiatus we see A.R. Rahman in full form. The Title Track gives the viewer a sense of elation and the colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more. Also other songs like 'Tu Bin Bataye', 'Paathshala', 'LukaChhupi' and 'Roobaroo' leave an impact on you.Full Marks to Rakesh MEhra for the treatment of the subject. There are a number of scenes that give you chills like:1) D.J.'s breakdown at Sue's house after returning from the hospital. 2) Madhavan's last remains brought to his house for his mother and friends. 3) Atul Kulkarni's delivery of the poem 'Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna' as Ramprasad Bismil. 4) the Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre sequence with replacing the Defence Miniter for General Dyer to explain its contemporary relevance.However, what really makes this movie a true accomplishment is the performances. All of the above would be non-existent if it wasn't for the stellar performance given by the entire cast. Aamir Khan is excellent as the care free Punjabi, but he doesn't steal all the attention. He is supported by equally riveting performances by Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni. Soha Ali Khan is a revelation compared to her prior films. Her breakdown on hearing of Madhavan's death is one on the most amazing scenes from the movie. Alice Patton is equally good. Her Hindi is sure to strike a chord with the Indian cinegoers. Also, absolutely amazing performances come from Waheedaji and Kirronji. Both lend brilliant support to the movie. One the whole, this movie is a novel experience. A definite recommendation to every youth of India as well as the World. It is a movie that gives you fodder for thought. Also, it is one of those few movies that actually lives up to its tagline: A Generation Awakens.
Movies we view come and go, releasing from our minds; however, this particular movie left behind a mark in my heart. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message, and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences, ministers, corruption, unemployment, etc...Yet, rarely any one steps up to change what's wrong, and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society, and change what is erroneous. EVerything about this movie is just absolutely unique - the screenplay, the colors, the performances, the songs...EVERYTHING. All actors played their roles top-notch. Every actor had an impact in the movie, and should've received equal credit from my perspective. Amir, Sharman, Siddharth, Kunal, Atul, Soha, Waheeda, every one stepped up to the plate. Some actors were over looked,such as Alice Patten and Sharman Joshi. Alice had dedication towards her work - her Hindi was very well fluent, and so were her expressions. Sharman did a great job acting innocently comic. Soha's reaction after Ajay's death was natural - she fitted into the very skin of her character. Siddharth is a fantastic actor, and hopefully will make it big in Bollywood one day, he handled his character to the maximum level. Amir, as usual, did not disappoint. He was awesome, and very authentic. The movie was modern - so today, and it was something that we can easily relate to. Honestly, when I first purchased the movie last year, I thought it was an over-rated movie just because of Amir Khan's comeback; nonetheless, after watching it, I was proved wrong. It was just "wow", beyond words. I couldn't manage not to cry at the end. THe quotes in the movie were just lovely, and has the possession of very deep meanings.Overall, this movie deserves a 10, without any questioning. It is a message to the youth of the present era. Get out there - change the negative aspects of the world. This movie DOES NOT ONLY GO FOR INDIANS, however all other countries in south Asia, which contains issues such as corruption, over population, and so forth. I am a Bengali, and the movie impressed me as much as any Indian - because the situations in Bangladesh is alike. Ministers are stealing the country's money, and they are not caring about the people, or doing anything to improve the country. People suffer each day - due to their very actions. It taught me that we should do something about my country's political groups, and Prime Ministers. WHOEVER DID NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE MISSING - go watch it! =D.
RDB is the rise of a new genre of films for today's youth that will be hailed as one of the all time classics. If Yuva was the ignition RDB is the Spark that lights the fire.A script that is almost flawless and executed with unimaginable comparisons to the pre-independence era is extremely hard to portray. Also to grasp the audience by the throat from the word 'Go' in this over critical world is stunning.I've watched RDB about a dozen times now and I must say it is equally powerful for the message that needs to be conveyed regarding "doing" rather than "gossipping" and "being a spectator or passenger in the so called 'system'". We have all been there, we have all done it and are still doing it but RDB makes you more than just aware of it.A virtual tag line "Koi Bhi Desh perfect nahi hota, Usey Behther Banaana Padtha hai" is quite adorable and delivered by different personalities with exactly opposite ideals, at different times in the movie. Was it right to eliminate a bad powerful person? Maybe Not but it is definitely a way to get the QUICK attention of the ever so unfocused youth of India, myself included.R.O.P.Mehra has presented RDB for the youth and done full justice to them. At the end of RDB, one definitely feels that he has had some kind of rub-in with the government regarding MIG's. He seems to have put his heart and soul into RDB. I wouldn't be surprised if his closest kin was one of the pilots affected due to bad parts in the MIG's.Aamir Khan as DJ (short for Diljeet) has essayed a role that is funny yet focused, comic yet concerned, silly yet sensible and a loafer who becomes a leader. The complexity of this character is probably lost because of the ease at which Aamir is able to become DJ. Being a Bombay-ite to transform into this ever so likable Dilli-ite with that awesome Punjabi "oye pehen de takke.." transformation was dumbfounding. On the other hand he is Chandrashekar Azard. No Doubt.Siddharth as Karan Singhania & Bhagat Singh is a revelation. A calmness shown by him breathing life into a character who just "Loathes India" and becomes the voice of the 5 man "Rebels with a cause" is sometimes too hot to handle. The emotions and the sincerity of the character are given more than enough respect by Siddharth. He will go a long way in handling intense roles very easily.Soha Ali Khan as Sonia urf Durga Bhabhi is fresh and practical. She does have lots of similarities to Saif Ali Khan but still stands out as her own woman, not just a Sharmila Tagor or SAK clone.Madhavan in his short role as Lft. Ajay is very effective and has a magnetic presence that the group of friends look up to. His chemistry with Soha is simply natural.Sharman Joshi as Sukhi has perfect comic timing and is a great sidekick to DJ's jokes. He does show his ability of serious shades when the film turns into a "fighting for a cause" saga from a light one.Now, the newcomer that I think will get a lot of looks due to his personality and charisma is Kunal Kapoor as Aslam. His difficulty in dealing with a petty family clinging to old virtues and his loyalty to his friends is just too perfect. His physique can only add to his characters in the movies to come and he could be the perfect raw material for directors who want the next "Angry, Sensitive and Sensible" young man.I just hope RDB does not stay just a movie but truly awakens India. This one is a 10/10 for sure.
Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra merges two plots in RANG DE BASANTI. The first is about a group of friends, their bonding, the carefree lifestyle they lead. The second plot pertains to the past, when freedom fighters sacrificed their lives during the era before independence. Mehra draws parallels between Indians ruled by the British and Indians ruled by corrupt politicians today. The message is subtle at first, but echoes piercingly before it reaches its finale. The transition of the five friends from meaningless to meaningful existence is done brilliantly.Rang De Basanti has a story to tell, is not a ripoff of some exotic film, but the story is told at a leisurely pace. Is it a patriotic film? Yes and no. Is it a fun film? Yes and no. Is it a serious film? Yes and no. Does it have a neat ending? Yes and no.Thats the beauty of Rang de Basanti. Its the film which shows that bollywood is indeed coming of age.A R Rahman lives to his reputation in Rang De Basanti. Binod Pradhan's cinematography is lyrical, and Adman Prasoon Joshi evokes the youth lingo with his dialogues. Sameer Chanda's art direction and Allan Amin's action sequences are its other strong points.Aamir gets into the skin of the character and delivers a knockout performance from start to end, but the film has more gems when it comes to performances: Siddharth is excellent, Atul Kulkarni is fantastic, Soha Ali Khan is a complete revelation, Kunal Kapoor is natural and Sharman Joshi delivers a powerful performance.Alice Patten is brilliant and besides delivering a flawless performance, her style of speaking Hindi is sure to win a lot of hearts. Madhavan is likable. Waheeda Rehman is graceful as ever. Both Om Puri and Anupam Kher don't get much scope. Kiron Kher is exceptional yet again. Mohan Agashe, Steven Mckintosh, K.K. Raina and Lekh Tandon are adequate.But ultimately, despite sharing the screen space with others, this is an Aamir Khan film. And the actor, playing a character 15 years younger, lives the role, conveying the right amount of mischief (as in the banter in Hindi with Sue without realizing she knows the language), carefree flippancy, earnestness, insecurity, even breaking down on screen, and keeping his infectious laughter till the very end.Well, in the movie its said " I always thought that there are two kinds of men; those who met their deaths screaming and those who die in silence. And then I met the third kind" Similar type of feeling triggered in my mind too, There are movies made with some moral(some underlying message), some are pure entertainers, not making much sense. Yesterday i came to know about the third kind...........that leaves you with a thought, a thought...................


                
In continuation of Indian Cinema's new found interest in dishing out sensible stuff, Rang De Basanti is a runaway winner in terms of acting, direction, screenplay..you name it, and of course MESSAGE. The movie very aptly captures the lives of our youth, but more importantly goes further than portraying a carefree hedonistic lifestyle by providing them important issues to deliberate on. Like how to pro actively deal with corruption, and how to respect the sacrifices made by our predecessors to achieve our almost taken-for-granted independence. Also, the issue of equanimity between Hindus and Muslims is dealt with very well. The camera-work is fantastic. Great scenes captured from Delhi and other places. A lot of sharp humor interspersed with the typical Punjabi-style wit acted by Aamir Khan. Sidharth Narayan and Kunal Kapoor have done their roles proud. Soha Ali Khan is as cute as can be and does a very mature role. Sharman Joshi, however, is the pick of the lot as his role involves a lot of grey areas and changing character. In all, a MUST SEE for Indians everywhere! I'd give this movie a perfect 10!


                
i juz finished watching RDB ... and I'm Speechless! I'm a Pakistani, but i had tears in my during ending episodes. whether, it is Pakistan or India, both govt. are corrupted and we are corrupted. Nowadays, we are living but without a soul. This movie followed by Swades, made me and i hope my friends ... ppl from my generation will wake us from living such dead and shallow life. RDB is definitely one of the best shown the ugly side of politics however politics is ugly ... One should realise how our ancestors sacrificed themselves for their and Our's Independence Which we take for granted. We should be ashamed of ourselves. We keep saying abt revolution and change and same time, say our country has no future. How it is possible, when we feel nothing for our country? Well, this should be my review on the movie but i wrote what i really felt at the end of the show. Must say ... buy your next show ticket and Be Patriotic ..Just for once please! thanksfrom, a person living far from his own homeland and just thinking about his own life.


                
This that rare kind of movies which tells you a story blending contemporary present and known past in a way that dividing line is blurred and a message for future emanates as clearly as it could be. Strong characters, amazing editing and sequence, excellent cinematography, contextual and great music. All in All "Aamir Khan" is to bollywood what "Tom Hanks" to Hollywood. First half is just university and college fun as visible in day to day campus life in cities. In fact initial sequence on auditions is as real as it could be and does comment on sorry state of affairs when it comes to self-confidence and meaningfulness of youthful ness. Movie is quite clean on details and scenes of events like kakori, parliament bombing touch a chord though they have been played time and again.A must watch!!


                
"Saare politicians KO line mein khade kar ke goli se udaa dena chahiye".That line said by the first caller makes the climax of Rang De Basanti work. It throws back at us the hollowness of our words. You only have to hear the audience laugh. We are laughing at ourselves. It is so outrageous and yet so.. so.. believable. I feel a sense of pride in the fact that I belong to a society where a film like Rang De Basanti is made and then shown openly. The film gets away with murder. It is surprising that it didn't create more controversy than it actually did. Perhaps, because the film is making a point here, an argument which is not easy to refute.Films have been made before on similar anti-establishment themes. One has always enjoyed watching Hu Tu Tu every time it's shown on TV. Hazaaron Khwahishein Aisi was, I thought, one of the best movies of last year. But after Rang De Basanti, these films now smack of intellectual elitism. You really don't need to be a student of political science or a kurta-wearing socialist to think and talk about revolutions and changing societies. The characters here are you and me and your friends in the neighbourhood. One of them, in fact, is a self-confessed loser.The film asks a lot of questions at various levels, some very subtle. For instance, Bhagat Singh and Rajguru can court arrest in British occupied India and expect a fair trial so as to be able to put forth their point. But our characters from 21st century India can't even dream of doing the same. They have to instead<U+0085><U+0085><U+0085>..Perhaps too much is being read into it. It is only a film after all. A commercial venture out there to make a profit. But then what is it that makes people think and debate issues? Books? Lectures? Newspaper articles? Then why not films? Why not films with songs? Why not films with songs and a superstar? One had always believed that words are more effective than visuals. Rang De Basanti shows you the power of imagery. The effect created would have been impossible with the written or the spoken word.Dean Jones was recently saying to Sivaramakrishnan that we tend to use words like 'great' and 'genius' too liberally. So I will restrain myself. But, Rang De Basanti is my all time favourite movie. Even in terms of pure cinematic experience. Just when you thought you had seen it all.That was my two pence worth.From the receiving end of 'Look who's talking' ARIF ATTAR
This movie is one of the best I have seen. It is beautifully directed, flows well, raises issues and suggests courses of action to give direction to youth........... all without heavy philosophizing.It brings to our attention the corruption of some of the politicians and how the consequences of their greed destroy lives but they refuse to accept responsibility. It raises issues of the fears of the youth to step out of the shelter of 'safe' college environment and their comfort zone to actually face life and take on the responsibilities of earning a living and marriage and family........ going from being 'somebody' whom everyone knows and respects to being a 'nobody' in the real world.All this is done in a humorous, poignant and subtle manner. Leaves you with hope, desire for action and a sense of direction. History repeating itself with a different cast of characters. Three hours well spent!


                
I feel my self lucky that i just realize that there are still good movies out there. Why am i lucky??? Because i have got too many titles to watch and enjoy as of today. Thank you khan thank you India. Warm, happy, mind tickling, funny... Only three days ago i was not aware of bollywood and aamir khan but know they got me and i am a fan. It was pure luck, my girlfriend somehow watched the movie online in my ipad one night, the next day while i was checking the tabs i just saw the tab for p.k. I just click the play and i was in for abt 170 mins without blinking of an eye :) i wish i should be able watch in the theater but in Turkey there is no chance so far.


                
Absolutely no words required for you if you relate to India in some or the other way or know something about India or want to know something about India. Just a word of caution, this movie may keep you thinking for hours if not days and weeks. Aamir Khan, Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra, and even A. R. Rahman just contributed to shoot something as eruptive and yet gorgeous as India - more of a Before and After comparison where there is not much of a difference. Bottomline: Kudos to Mr Mehra for shooting the longest ever commercial till date. The movie sells it to you. And, hard sells!A. R. Rahman got the nerve of the movie and composed his usual best, but still nothing compared to Roja yet. Mehra got lucky and I would have prayed him if only I were to decide not to watch his other movies. Aamir gets lucky every time, he is a carefully marketed commodity which won't lose its luster in the near future, at the least.


                
Now I won't really go into detail about the plot because the idea is great, honestly it alone could have made the movie pretty good. The cinema style and the realism of the movie is what got to me. Stuff like this has happened before throughout history where people take the law into their own hands for the sake of justice. For the sake of clearing corruption. Rang De Basanti makes you think. No matter what your viewpoint is on government, politics and corruption because even the characters themselves are split. This was the first movie (Not just Bollywood) that actually made me put myself into the situation of a revolutionary and in the position of a politic leader. The passion some people have for their country and the freedom of others is remarkable. Before this movie I thought about the topic only when necessary because as an American, we don't directly witness the corruption. Many don't until it's pointed out towards them. Every person in the world needs to watch this movie. Because no government is perfect, we must make it perfect. As I said before this movie will make you think and leave an after-effect for days. You might be the type to criticize the government but never do anything to actually help, there's a character for that. Even he see's what he must do and what is right, only the situation can show who can be a true revolutionary.How did it do all that? Well like I said before the plot is pretty good, it's original and it has good direction. What make this movie spectacular? The great cast and their performances is the first thing that needs to be pointed out. Alice Patten does a great job and really blends into her role more than any character. Not saying the others don't but she just does it so brilliantly. She was ideal for the role because she has the mild beauty and spark. Amir Khan obviously outshines the rest of the cast again. Can you believe this man is 46? I couldn't during the movie. I didn't once think "Hey look at the 46 year old who has a teenage daughter my age." because he completely melted into his character. Spectacular performance. He pretty much blended into the rest of the gang but obviously. He blended into his character who was the hardest to portray. The rest of the cast was about the same but Siddhartha did stand out. His character was the rich youth who only shows negativeness. Without these characters exactly where they needed to be...this movie might have not been so great.The second thing that made this movie stand out was the utilization of the Past-Present shift technique through colored flashbacks. It kept me entertained and both astonished at how bad the revolution was in India. The Music was excellent, I wouldn't say the movie couldn't have gotten better music but it did set a realistic mood. Thank god this wasn't a musical or all respect for the movie would have gone down. This movie shouldn't be compared to Swades. Although that is a great movie, that's what it was...just a movie. Rang De Basanti is a call for change and an eye-opener. Every Desi should watch this movie because the condition in Pakistan and Bangladesh are exactly the same as India.


                
It is an excellent movie which truly reflects the growing revolutionary-youth-movement in India at present (post 2000). The problem with the MIG flight planes is long, but government has never taken any serious resolution. This movie rightly depicts the situation of a family suffering from this governmental negligence. An Indian army plot dies in a MIG accident. It brings his group of friends start thinking about the social & political problems in India which they always avoided and thought the governmental policies will never going to affect their life directly anyway. This common people's idea fired back and they even determined to give a repartee to the Indian Government. They assassinated the defense Minister and went public by Radio to announce the cause of their inhuman deed. Though the Government took it as a serious offense but their way of protests worked as an eye-opening for common people.In real life, this movie has already influenced serious public-protests against many governmental policy and some have forced the governmental to go by the public opinion. I would say it a true triumph of democracy and "Rang De Basanti" just plays that right tune.


                
When I started watching this movie I was like this cant be a good one. About some random kids acting all over the place. But I had Amir Khans old movies in mind. The guy can really act. But just like what the other users said this isn't all about him. All other actors did an amazing job.I am myself a paki-American, being raised in a paki family and visited there I know what corruption is and what people deal with everyday. This movie does an amazing job of waking people up. Its time to wake up people, and make or break your life. I hope this gets nominated for an Oscar like Lagaan did.


                
Of late, Bollywood movies are awakening to shed its chocolate-movies image. Passionate and patriotic movies such as Indian, Fiza, Sarfarosh, Swades, and etc have intermittently showed the glitters of Bollywood - propagating that Bollywood too can produce inspiring and refreshing movies. But Rang De Basanti (RDB) cannot be called a movie. It is something more, has transcended the realm of a movie-zone (to be precise, Bollywood movie-zone). After watching the RDB (I don't want to categorize it as a movie) no one can or should say that Bollywood movies are just laden with huge costumes, dances, unrealistic and dramatized characters.RDB is so refreshing in all its facets that it makes you think differently. SMS generation deems any message with more than four-lines as a lecture. So the generation needs to be admonished differently, and the way the parallels drawn from the Freedom struggle from aliens with the current Freedom struggle from your own bureaucracy stands out tall among other all-beautiful-tenets of this RDB.Amir Khan is a delight to watch in RDB. Amir Khan's crying because of his helplessness in just being a spectator to the Rapid Action Force's lathi-charge on the silent revolutionaries sums out the veritable young Indian citizen's anguish. The frolic and fun-filled youth belie the very serious resolution they possess. Sidharth's role is controlled and yet most powerful. He conveys a youth's ideals and executes their wish to the hilt.Hats off to the director, Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, for making such a wonderful bigger-than-a-movie called RDB. RDB would surely lift the Bollywood to new heights. Rahman's music and taut screenplay gels perfectly with the movie. Special mention has to be made about Soha Ali Khan and Alice Payton (played as Sue). They both are stunning. They are far better than the aspiring (obviously Miss World/Universe beauty queens) and most of the current female actresses.


                
Words fall short when the time comes to parlay my emotional state in order to describe the film. What starts as a breath of youthful exuberance, matures into an impassioned flame of truth only to be snubbed when the flame blazes in all it's glory. This is a kind of cinema that shakes a person to its core.We begin with a look to India at the time of The Raj, and are introduced to an English jail officer guarding the Freedom Fighters of Hind. Form there beings the tale of Sue in modern times, who is wanting to make a documentary about the Freedom Fighters of Hind and her Grandfather the jailer in charge of the Freedom Fighters. Sue goes to India to translate her Grandfather's personal diary and interaction with the Freedom Fighters into a documentary. She finds the actors to play the respective Freedom Fighter, right under her nose, in the group of people whom Sue befriends while living at a University in Delhi where Sue had been invited to stay.Events unfold and the lines between the story of the historical documentary and real life being to blur. What remains in the end is a sight to be beheld. This is a tale to the fight to death, so that the truth and justice can be upheld. "Inqilaab Zindahabaad! Long Live Revolution."....Mohe Mohe Tu Rang De Basanti.

I have watched this movie twice and undoubtedly i rank this movie as one of the best movie I have ever seen. This movie makes a parallel comment on India's Freedom Fighting Movement and 21st century youth. There lies a rebellion in all of us and it just requires a triggering moment to stand against corruption, bureaucracy and envisage patriotism in your heart.It's not about remembering freedom fighters but a metamorphism of those patriotic into today's youth. Few youths thinks that freedom movement is dead in Indian history and just limited to books but later on they realize that we want another freedom movement against corruption and bureaucracy.All songs are beautifully choreographed and a marvelous performance by all characters.


                
i went for this movie with a lot of high expectations, and i dreaded the possibility of it being disliked. but it hasn't let me down...there were times where i was left open-mouthed and wide-eyed while watching this film...it hits you hard in the face...it gives you a very natural projection of the youth of India...those who are more interested in partying than anything else, and how their eyes open and stare at their country. extremely patriotic and very moving, this film is going to be one among the best films in Indian movie history. all the actors gave us stunning performances and aamir was simply superb. the direction was awesome and...i just have no words to express...this is an amazing movie...and if you haven't watched yet, then i think you're one of the most sad people in India, literally...watch it..now..
