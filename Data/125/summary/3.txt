 "Only when he learned he would die did he start to live!"

 The most moving and human film I have ever seen.

 To Live in Death

 Beautiful & touching, also very clever

 a cinematic experience that's a near-nexus of existentialism- life, living, dying, death, and can be done while alive- remarkable

 Complex and thought-provoking masterpiece

 Simply Brilliant - Kurosawa's Greatest

 Not just a film, but an incredible learning experience

 Kurosawa is Kafka going Kawabata...

 A cinematic tour de force

 Coming Alive

 The examined life...

 Overrated

 The second hour of the film fails to capture the greatness of the first.

 "I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that"

 Never is too Late to Live, Watch the Sunset and Plant a Seed of Love

 Excellent , must see for everyone it can change your thought about life

 One of those movies you just have to see

 A masterpiece of international cinema.

 An incredibly well-written and acted story about the meaning of life

 Don't you see? You're risking your life!

 How shall we than live?

 Best of Akira Kurosawa
