 One Room Thriller

 M for masterful

 A mean husband concocts an intricate plan to murder his unfaithful wife for her money

 Kind of slow but still pretty good Hitchcock

 Not the Best Hitchcock

 Expertly Made But Decidedly Minor

 Stagebound Hitchcock thriller with flashes of ingenuity, strong performances, and good suspense.

 Classic Hitchcock thriller!

 Well made, but too dependant on details

 Terrific performances, especially enjoyed Bob Cummings and John Williams. A real gem!

 Low-Key But Brilliantly Written And Directed Drawing Room Murder Thriller

 Nothing ever goes fully according to plan <U+0085>

 Something Amiss .....

 From stage to screen, brilliant in transition

 Engrossing Hitchcock Thriller

 It will keep you guessing.

 Fairly good Hitchcock thriller

 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife

 Must Be Seen in 3D

 Polished screen version of Broadway play...

 Why Grace Kelly

 Great style, but not so much substance !!!

 Flat 3-D Film From Hitchcock

 H For Hitchcock.
