 Magnum Hopeless

 Dull

 Drunks go to war

 This movie sucks

 Excruciatingly dull

 A bloated bore.

 Hollow, self important claptrap

 The emperor's new clothes

 Very Overated

 Overrated Nonsense!

 Let's be honest, people. This movie is not near what its reputation would lead you to believe

 An entire movie about Russian roulette!

 cravenator..............

 One of the most superficial movie on Vietnam war

 Lets do the Awards over again!!!

 A minor footnote

 I kept waiting for it to really begin and but it never did.

 As overrated as Dances with Wolves.
