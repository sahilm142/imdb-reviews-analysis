 Not as good as people say

 Certainly bingeworthy. Not a masterpiece.

 BTK-The ultimate case study?

 Unsure where this will lead to.

 Partners solve murders, interesting twist on the "buddy flick" shows

 The Beginning Of Hunting Minds

 plot has potential

 Its a good show. Very interesting but slow.

 Starts off really good then you feel the influence of PC-ness and a need for longevity creeping in

 Quite interesting show about the beginning of psychological profiling

 Good watch, ruined slightly by Netflix's lazy writers

 For Fincher fans.

 Slow to start

 Binge away

 Good acting and interesting story telling but not as smart as people say

 Full season review: Could have been a lot better

 The psycho path is long and boring, but ultimately is worth taken it

 Pretentious but entertaining.
