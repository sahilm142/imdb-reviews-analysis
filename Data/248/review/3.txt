contains allusions to spoilers ;) After the magnificent Blue & White, I expected Red to be as amazing and affecting a film -- not only stylistically impressive, but philosophical and involving as well. Certainly Red is the first, but as for the other two? On the philosophical side, certainly there is the old man's nihilism for much of the film, but what does Kieslowski counter this with? The final scene? I fail to see how that does anything aside from connect several disparate people together in a rather trite _Magnolia_-esque manner, to which I say (as I did in that movie), "So what?" And as for being involving or affecting, this film totally strikes out for me. Both of the two main characters are vastly underdeveloped and largely unsympathetic. The newly-robed judge was somewhat more interesting initially, but due to his role as a sort of meta-character, he came up shallow in the end as well (where is the payoff?). I found myself repeatedly shouting, "Who cares!" at the screen whenever anything of importance happened to these characters. Indeed, the only figure in the movie I found myself to be remotely sympathetic to was the dog.Blue and White are wonderful pieces of film. It is truly a tragedy that Kieslowski couldn't pull the hat trick with Red.
