 Most overrated film I have ever seen...

 Much Ado About Nothing

 generally hopeless

 Frankly My Dear, This Movie Sucks

 Can't separate content from context--and oh those ayksents!

 Hollywood's most loved film - but what in God's name is there to love?!!!

 I really didn't give a d*mn

 I don't get it.

 Just boring

 Film Classic my foot!!

 I would love this movie if I were a woman

 A Decent Film

 Extremely Boring & Over-Rated.

 Jon Monsarrat review: racist undertones, plot moves along

 The Movie Itself Should Have Gone With the Wind
