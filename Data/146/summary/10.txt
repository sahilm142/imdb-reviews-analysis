 Kazan's film constitutes an extraordinary tour de force of fluid direction and nervous, edgy acting<U+0085>

 Protecting All That's Tragic

 Powerful every time I see it

 A film I consider absolutely perfect

 Magnificent statement about the power of one

 Still Packs A Wallop

 My extended review of the film

 Quite simply a classic

 I could have been somebody...

 I could a been a contender. I could've been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.

 Simply one of the best

 Brando At His Best

 An Excellent Crime Drama Film with a Christian Message

 "I coulda been a contender,i coulda been somebody,instead of a bum,which is what i am,lets face it"

 Tough, Tough, Tough!

 It's a Contender

 Content With Ignorance.

 Life Is Pretty Bad In Palookaville

 "It wasn't your night, kid? You remember that?"

 Excellent acting and writing--that's what it's all about

 "Conscience... that stuff can drive you nuts!"

 Perfection never gets closer

 Timeless and immortal

 Simply Stunning

 "I Coulda Been A Contender"
