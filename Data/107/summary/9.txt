 The finest example of the Spaghetti Western revolution

 One of Best Westerns Ever Made

 An Ushering Into A New Era

 Great Western! Awesome on all levels

 Lee Van Cleef outstanding

 Worth more than a fistful of dollars

 Well, well; if it isn't the smoker. Well...

 Leave Indio to me

 Once upon a time when men were still men...

 My favourite Dollars film

 "When the chimes end, pick up your gun."

 Watched With A Blind Eye

 In a world where life had no value<U+0085>

 Often Overlooked, But Still Phenomenal

 A terrific film--one of the best of the Italian Westerns

 The king of westerns

 An excellent movie, although I was slightly disappointed

 One of the greatest middle films of all time.

 I was worried about you - all alone, with so many problems to solve...

 Indeed a perfect one ! couldn't have asked for few more!

 Better than First "Dollars".

 Exciting,Action-Packed and Very Entertiaining,

 The most underrated but the best

 Real best "spaghetti western" film!

 Clint Eastwood is back for a few dollars more.
