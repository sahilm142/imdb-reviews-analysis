 I love it, but it tears me apart in many ways.

 Stunning

 So far so good

 Albert, I have to admit I don't understand this situation at all

 Twin Empires

 Red Room, RED ROOM !

 An Almost Flawless Return to a Great Show...

 Lynch Unleashed

 Sublime

 Slow, silly, but a breath of fresh air on today's TV.

 A mass LYNCHING

 Wow, just wow.

 Unique form of storytelling

 As Lynchy as expected

 Persist with it...

 Enigmatic !! You could be missing the point here.

 Too early to tell if it holds up to the original show & FWWM

 it has that special quality of something you can't look away from

 A revolutionary tv show

 I Trust David Lynch

 A rich, dark, and satirical masterpiece that demands patience

 I Changed My Mind

 A near-perfect exploration of mindfulness and anxiety's relationship to time

 For those who enjoy the avant-garde as moving puzzle

 Incredibly beautiful.
