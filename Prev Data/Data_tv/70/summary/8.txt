 Soft Start, Boffo Finish

 Cute, funny, smart

 Alex Borstein for MVP

 Charming, but empty

 Love Mrs. Maisel

 Loved season 2

 We're going to the Catskills

 Maisel Tov, Rucheleh! Hit-or-miss series stumbles toward a big finish.

 Quirky Edgy and Funny

 A unique series with twists

 Not Historically Accurate

 Idea

 Nice Comedy/Drama Show

 More F Bombs Than The Blair Witch Project

 Not for everyone, enjoyable if you like over the top cutesy, weirdness, and nostalgia for things you did not experience. Watch it anyway!

 Good Enough

 Wonderful comedy

 Gold!

 Sterling Ensemble casting

 Refreshing, quick witted, smart comedy
