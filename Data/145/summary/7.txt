 Beware the p(l)ot holes near the billboards

 great acting!

 Deceptive Ending Without a Conclusion

 McDormand is in fine form

 This is the end?

 Good film, no ending.

 Better than expected

 Lost potential at some points

 Great cast, great story.

 A Tale with No Easy Answers

 There better be a sequal

 Fabulous film, with some terrible moments.

 The ending could have been better, but overall it was a decent film.

 A True Dark Comedy

 Great, Unpredictable Story, But Poorly Paced

 McDonagh Delivers Another Well-Made Dark Comedy

 looks like a western but not

 Dramatic Comedy

 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri (2017)

 Hilarious and emotional at times.

 It is interesting, but just interesting

 A Masterclass in acting that is only dragged down by underwhelming writing

 Good but

 a movie that had its release in the best possible moment.

 Brilliant Francis McDormand all the way...
