 Solid war movie

 A personal and gut-wrenching look at the Vietnam War

 Good Movie

 Hard-hitting, and then some

 Overrated, Yet Very Good

 so-so

 It was good but...

 Typical Stone

 Overwrought but intense

 Strong Film With Some Flaws

 The "logic" behind Taylor and Elias

 Quite good...but

 Expecting more, but was good

 Great

 it's not AWESOME

 Truly Suspenceful.

 Supreme. An opera.

 Inaccurate but still powerful

 Emotionally engaging.

 A Disturbing Veitnam Movie That is a Must See

 A war film that doesn't seem long enough

 Visually great, but...

 "Born on the Fourth of July" was better

 Balanced view of war deeds

 don't watch if u are looking for serious cinema
