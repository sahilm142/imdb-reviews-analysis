 Yes, it's THAT good !!

 Another Disney/Pixar Classic

 Pixar Remains the Best Family Film Industry Out There Today...

 Thoroughly enjoyable, but the sum does not equal the parts.

 Pretty great.

 Mine! Mine! Mine!

 Humanistic Approach to the Film

 Lovely Adventure

 They did it again

 Beautiful

 Merci Pixar!

 Visually appealing animation and great plot.

 Good film for youth

 The fish who was kidnapped by a dentist.

 Pretty good

 A nice feel good movie, what do you expect from animation.

 Overrated But Nice Children Movie(SPOILERS)

 A presentation of Dory's personality by expression.

 Where's the music?

 Fun film, entertaining, worth the 8 bucks

 `Finding Nemo' is a treat for anyone seeking a fresh look at the computer-animated genre of family entertainment.

 Once again, Pixar has outdone itself.

 Entertaining film for the family

 One of the best children's movie in a long time...
