 I can't look away...

 A Disappointment From A Master Director

 Don't you get it? You're a rat in a maze.

 Predictable, yet Scorsese

 Marty needs a new editor

 who is 67?

 A rewarding and well acted 120 minutes

 Many great parts, but overall, a smidge boring.

 A thinking man's psychological thriller gets the royal treatment from Scorsese and company...

 Scorsese's signature

 Martin Scorsese's take on Dennis Lehane's Shutter Island

 ... One More Time

 Potentially a good movie

 Followed book perfectly! Music was a bit much.

 Island of high expectations but slightly lobotomized results<U+0085>

 Nice thriller, with some flaws.

 Good visuals, but disappointing

 "Shutter Island"

 Mind Games

 uneven, sappy, kinda shallow, but looks good

 It's so well made, the unsurprising twists end up deflating a visual masterpiece

 A flawed masterpiece.

 Someone is missing.

 Ending left me feeling cheated

 An intelligent psychological fiction that turns into a dilemma
