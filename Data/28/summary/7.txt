 total of all stereotypes in formula routine film with no assets

 Don't read Agatha Christie

 Not Entirely Unusual

 Good, but not THAT good

 Good, but not great.

 Making a simple plan complicated doesn't make one brilliant

 Very clever but rather empty

 The plot has more holes in it than Bonnie and Clyde's death car.

 Overrated

 Oh My God

 Great concept, overly contrived result

 Twist-Laden Story.

 Good movie but overrated

 The Usual Suspects — Criminals versus criminals, and everyone chasing their own tail

 Entertaining enough thriller, but treats common-sense with reckless disregard.

 I imagine this film was superbly effective when it was first released

 slightly predictable ???

 Very clever and superficially entertaining, but unsatisfying

 Good film

 The real suspects

 Bizarre

 A Must See

 Fun Classic Film Is EXTREMELY Predictable

 The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. And like that, poof. He's gone"
