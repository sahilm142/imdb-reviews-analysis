 Just trying to survive the war, so he could play piano again.

 Adagio

 Lacks a bit of character development and not as powerful as I expected it to be

 Okay, but stands under the constant shadow of "Schindler's List," and is even more unabashedly sentimental

 "Please, forgive me for stealing my right of life, which you own, which is between your hands!"

 Excellent effects, authentic display of Nazi-violence, but lacks otherwise

 Good, but not Great.

 Music was his passion. Survival was his instinct.

 Good film!

 non-heroism

 "Germans won't use Jewish toilets...the toilets are too clean for them."

 A Jewish musician trying to survive the German occupation of Warsaw

 A powerful film

 Good but really sad!!

 the sad sweetness of the sound of persecution.

 One man's struggle to survive.

 VERY WELL DONE ALTHOUGH A LITTLE LONG

 Polansky goes to the war!

 Victim and witness

 Brutal, but hard to turn away.

 Great start, slow pacing middle, triumphant end

 Good, Interesting, but not Great.

 Not as good as "Schindler's List"

 A good supplement to Schindler's List

 Very well done however...
