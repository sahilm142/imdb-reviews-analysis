 My Favorite Adult Swim Original

 Best cartoon I've seen in years.

 Adult Swim Redeemed

 Perhaps the most perfect cartoon ever.

 A Brilliant Blast From The Past!

 Go Team Venture!

 Pseudo-Retro High Adventure Parody

 A must watch!

 One of the funniest shows around...

 RELEASE THE BUTTERFLIES...okay, whose job was it to feed the butterflies.

 It was the highest ranked cartoon here

 An oasis in a bland, predictable TV world

 I guess not too many people have seen this...

 Venture Licious

 plain review

 A diamond in the rough...

 Great show with great commentary

 The Season 4 Finale...

 Hilarious!

 Thank you Adult Swim!

 Go Team Venture!

 More people need to watch this show

 The Venture Bros is amazing and is getting better with season 6

 Fresh, Edgy, and Hilarious

 Best thing since spliced Dean-A
