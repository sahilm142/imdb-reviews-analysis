OK, the Simpson's is a good cartoon. But thats just it good, in the past year or so i've realised how unfunny the Simpson's really is, cause recently I've got into 2 cartoons and watching these 2 cartoons make me realise that the Simpson's isn't really that funny, you get a few chuckles thats about it no side splitting stuff. The 2 cartoons I'm talking about are sponge bob square pants and Family Guy which is the funniest cartoon ever made, and cracks me up every time not like the Simpson's does, the Simpson's has never cracked me up, i get more laughs in 1 episode of family guy and sponge bob then i do in a whole 10 eps of the Simpson's. Its good and classic but its just not funny
