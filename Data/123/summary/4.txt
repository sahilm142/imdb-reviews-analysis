 Is everyone on dope?

 No Out

 Heat is stone cold bad.

 Dreck

 "Heat" is Nothing More than Hot Air **

 Not a hit (dvd)

 An average thriller, overrated by the presence of De Nero and Pacino

 Should have been called Baggage rather than Heat

 There's less to this than meets the eye

 Really surprisingly bad

 A boring odyssey of boyish dreams of effects and "cool" characters

 Boring

 A marked moment in the Pacino decline
