 Real Review from Spiderfan

 Not good

 So, this was all the hyper hype? Really?

 It was painful

 An Honest Review

 Strange and Nonsensical

 Annoying

 I felt abused as Spiderman fan

 Terrible - absolutely TERRIBLE

 Mediocre

 What did I just watch?

 Terribly boring

 Overrated Fake Spider-Drivel

 For whom was this movie made?

 Just awful, a meandering mess led by an unlikable Miles Morales

 Walked out of the theater....

 Waste of time

 A confusing mess

 God awful

 Pretty lame

 Everything is perdictable

 WARNING! This Movie Can Cause Harm To Vision

 Why there is no 0 star

 Water of time and life.

 Unoriginal
