An elderly professor is on his way to get an award for his work. While traveling he thinks about his past, his family, friends and how he got to be where he is. Unfortunately the viewer is forced to watch it also!I'm a big fan of movies and I've seen other Bergman films but all the adoration this man has gotten puzzles me. His films are somber, grim (except for "Smiles of a Summer Night") and (basically) nothing ever happens in them! His "insights" into characters are ridiculously predictable and his little "lessons" about life are just laughable. I won't deny that some of his films LOOK beautiful and there's some good acting but the films themselves are boring. I heard this was a classic and should be seen by anyone interested in cinema. What I saw was a boring, grim and depressing drama that offered nothing new or interesting that I haven't seen before...and better done! The acting was good but I didn't care and wasn't interested one bit in the characters or situations. This may have been cutting edge in 1957--but I doubt it. Another overpraised drama from Bergman.
