 Irritating Load of Tosh

 What is wrong with you people?

 Over-hyped, over-rated

 A massively overrated piece of work

 Don't believe the hype

 It Stinks!

 Overrated

 Not just boring,but very,VERY boring.

 Good animated movie, but not a good anough movie to be #27 in the top 250- Too long, disjointed, and immature

 Another crazy Japanese director making no sense.

 A visual masterpiece, but a failure at storytelling

 I can't believe this is on the IMDb's top 250 list.

 Torturous -- over-rated

 Lacks any real storyline

 Spirited Away is annoying

 So - did absolutely nobody notice this had the exact same story-line as A Bug's Life?
