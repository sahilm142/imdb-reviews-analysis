 Too much and not enough at the same time

 An Avenger Butt-Kicking

 Plot Holes, Jumbled Action Sequences, & A Big Let Down, Oh My!

 All action no story

 Sad that so much was wasted on nothing

 I don't understand all the praise

 Solid Jokes, Solid Heroes, Good Aesthetic, Stupid story and villian

 My thoughts.

 Only good cause it ends without success?

 Be wary of the high rating! This isn't a good movie.

 Horrible ending... wish I would have waited for it to wind up on Redbox

 Overratted

 I am not disappointed and the main character is memerable!

 Terrible

 Do not believe the planted 10/10's, this is a disappointing movie overall.

 When will these end?

 Really pretty to look at and...well that's about it.

 Ultimately a disappointment.

 Disappointing, bad plot, inconsistent, make no sense at all!!

 No buildup, no plot, no nothing.

 Better than the other two avengers movies, but not by much

 Unpopular opinion: Over hyped!

 Movie with the first ending ever

 Ending

 Some decent fight scenes and a few funny parts but that's about it
