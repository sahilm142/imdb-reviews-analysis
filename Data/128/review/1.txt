One of the worst films I've seen, the plot is incredibly weak, although I thought I'd give it a shot as sometimes you get surprised. Can't believe I managed to watch this to the end, the acting is hurrendous from the children, the story is ridiculous and the ending is heavily anticlimactic. I wouldn't waste your time with this one.
