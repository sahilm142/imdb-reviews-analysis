 Good but overrated

 An interesting anthology experiment

 Anyone remember animatrix?

 Not convinced.

 Great stories

 It's the thought that matters

 Stories are good, but too much female objectification and fantasizing rape...

 Visually stunning!

 The first episode

 Sort of like a dumbed down version of Black Mirror

 Wow

 Robots, blood and broccoli.

 A Bit over rated but good

 This was rather good...
