 Matrix but in dreamworld? Nah.

 This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

 A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date

 A tool of hope.

 Didactic, but nonetheless a good movie.

 Why?

 Christopher Nolan has outdone himself yet again...

 You May Never Sleep Again

 What a GREAT Movie !!!

 WARNING : Nolan is putting an idea inside your mind !!!

 Wow...

 This decade's Matrix - Sheer Awesomeness

 the most complete grand-scale entertainment movie ever.............

 If You Don't Pay Attention, It will be Confusing

 This is a'Maze'ing movie

 The Diamond of Summer 2010

 Dreamy !!

 Super !!

 Dream Team

 its different, and yes, thrilling too, but.......

 Colossal and mind boggling execution of Christopher Nolan's perception of Dreams

 the entire film is Cobb's dream

 Hollywood owes us more than an "Inception", and a few philosophical thoughts

 A film that is, in and of itself, a puzzle

 Breathtaking masterpiece or $500 wallet?
