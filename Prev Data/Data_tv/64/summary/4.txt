 Great concept, terrible execution, grossly overrated

 This show thinks you're a moron

 95% discussion, 5% action

 highly overrated

 Meh don't understand the high rating

 Flashback

 crying and screaming

 Way too much personal drama

 Not really that great

 Why do people like this show?

 Great concept. The storyline and characters were a bit of a disappointment.

 Why is this popular?
