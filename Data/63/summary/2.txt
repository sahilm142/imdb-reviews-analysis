 Done to death

 Very well animated drivel pathetic mellifluous storytelling

 Wall-E is boring

 Bring a Book

 Great animation does not a great movie make

 Beautiful but less than I expected

 Dull and not the best movie for a kid

 You Ain't No Toy Story!

 Utterly Disappointing

 Bring a pillow

 Disappointing by Pixar standards

 Worst-E

 just a boring movie

 Im sorry.....but no!

 Very Disappointing

 Way better animation movies that have been made

 the clip is way better than the whole movie, entirely disappointing

 Garbage In, Garbage Out ! Pixar Falls Flat !
