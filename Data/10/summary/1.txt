 The comparison to Clockwork Orange makes me puke

 Action movie with an infantile, rubbish plot.

 Twilight for males.

 boring, over-rated, pretentious, confused, and very silly.

 ULTIMATE Dumb Guy movie.

 An awful bore

 What a completely hollow pose this strikes...

 The Most Ridiculous and Overrated Movie in the History of Mankind

 This clunker is so bad it made my DVD player start a protest movement. Undoubtedly the worst turkey in movie History.

 Precious and obvious

 435,000 people gave this movie a 10

 Most overrated POS on the top 250

 Something doesn't quite fit with this movie...

 all style, no substance

 It stinks!

 Overrated by wanna-be intellectuals

 Most Immature Movie I've Ever Seen

 Totally a baseless crap

 Wretched and Unforgivable

 One of the Stupidest Films Ever Made

 Good that it tries something different. Bad that it fails.

 This movie was not made for me

 Biggest,single most disappointing movie i have ever seen...

 Lame

 Disappointing
