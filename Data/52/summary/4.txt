 Good idea, poor execution.

 I didn't like it much

 Dull dull dull

 Who the heck said this was the scariest movie ever made?

 In space, no one can hear you yawn

 Badly Dated

 Tense; but may I be frank ?

 How the hell is this the second best horror ???

 What's that lurking behind you?????

 Unwittingly comical

 In space stories can run out of steam

 Extremely boring.

 Alien: Movie Review

 ALIEN (1979) is an overrated movie....it's success is based on gimmicks
