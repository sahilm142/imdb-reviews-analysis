 Lazy, incoherent, and unsatisfying on nearly every level.

 Choose your punishment Mr.Nolan, Death or Exile?

 General movie watchers opinion

 True Batman Fan's Worst Nightmare

 The god-awful third part of a good trilogy.

 Awful plot. People in this movie are sheep without character

 A bitter disappointment and awful ending to a brilliant trilogy.

 Rip-off of Bond film 'The world is Enough'.come out of Mass hysteria of hype

 Batman was not present much.

 The Dark Knight doesn't Rise, he Sinks Like A Stone.

 3 Areas of Disappointment

 Terrible movie!

 Batman calling, Mr. Nolan. Why so serious? He's suing you for libel.

 Reality check

 "The movie is all concept and no content; the elaborate special effects are like watching money burn on the screen. "

 Oh My God!!!!

 SOOO glad I watched this bootleg

 The Dark Knight at his worst

 Nonsensical Plot, Ridiculous ending

 What a piece of crap

 Rubbish

 Not worth the price of admission

 Worst of ALL Batman films

 So ridiculous it gets boring

 why would you care for a reasonable plot, you fools?
