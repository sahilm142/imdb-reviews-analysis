I'm really confused at what has happened in the last year. This was the greatest show on TV when Jon Stewart left..... When Trevor first took over it may not have been the same but it was pretty close to as good as when Jon was the host but the show now seems to be going in a different direction and the more I watch and hope that it's going to turn around the more I miss what the show used to be with Jon. It's not that I don't like Trevor because he does have some humor that I find enjoyable but it feel like he wears out the same concept/joke by using the same context with different subjects. I also just don't think he is as tuned in to politics and the subject matter. Both Jon and Trevor had/have writers that work on the majority of the script but Jon was involved and connected with that content and I just don't think that Trevor does. I find myself keeping up with Stephen Colbert and Seth Myers on their late shows more than I'm keeping up with TDS. The only two people on TDS that make things as fun as the show used to be is Roy Wood Jr. and Ronny Chieng and if it wasn't for them I probably wouldn't be watching the show at all -- at least I can currently hope that they make an appearance.
