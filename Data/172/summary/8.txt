 Don't be side tracked by the obvious twist.......there is more than one

 Another Martin-Leo Masterpiece!!!

 Once again, Scorsese has helped redefine a genre'

 The Eye Of The Master

 No Hitchcock horror but a brilliant chiller thriller from Scorcese!

 A top-notch movie,but a notch below the greats

 Shutter Island - Intrigue and Assumption

 Scorsese and DiCaprio Do It Again

 Intriguing, creepy, and engaging little puzzler - one of Scorsese's best

 Good but Predictable Psychological Thriller

 HK Neo Reviews: Shutter Island

 " Reality is a matter of circumstance, whomever you trust determines that "

 "Shutter Island"

 Enterntaining Film with Enormous Plot Holes.

 A B-movie plot with ambitious themes

 Well Done

 Scorsese + My Favourite Genre = Win

 Mediocre and disappointing

 It's all about perspective, putting you in the head-space of the protagonist and making you feel how he feels, and it works wonders.

 "Which would be worse, to live as a monster or die as a good man?"

 Excellent film.

 A solid entry from The Legend...

 Shutter Island An Excellent Suspenseful Thriller

 Don't you get it? You're a rat in a maze.

 Live a monster, or die a good man...
