 Anti-American Beauty

 Come on people - WAKE UP already!! It's no good!!!

 It was the Eastenders Christmas Special of 1986 in film.

 Very-Very-Very "American Ugly", If You Ask Me

 Slow study of dysfunctional neighbors (doesn't live up to the hype)

 Not a rose by far

 Truly awful

 most overrated film ever

 Summary: A Beauty so many fell for.........

 Saving Private Ryan was robbed!

 Mediocre at best

 Chillingly chic and defiantly dumb

 Nonsensical and lacking in structure.

 Do you need sleep?

 Bittersweet taste

 one good scene doesn't make a good movie

 No Big Deal

 Overrated is an understatement.

 crap.

 It's just another ordinary movie with really great actors

 Over-hyped piece of nothing

 If this is the future, show me BB's classics aisle

 Overrated, unoriginal

 Insipid pandering saved only partially by Kevin Spacey

 Having read the reviews, I'm glad I'm not alone
