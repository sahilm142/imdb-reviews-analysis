 -Andhadhun-

 good but not a masterpiece as many ppl here acclaim.

 Enjoyable thriller but...

 Simply overrared...

 Andhadhun: The worst part of the movie is that it ends.

 A bit logic!

 A Blind story about a dumb and extremely good person in current world

 NOTHING IS PERFECT,LOOPHOLES EXIST

 Nice movie something different

 Don't go by the review hype or the plot summary here at IMDb, the movie is unlike what is suggested!

 Good but not there yet

 Worth Watching

 Very creative but characters could have been built better

 Excellent Movie spoilt by the last 30 minutes

 Entertaining but expected more

 Lack of clarity

 Where Agatha Christie meets Robin Cook!

 New (target audience) to specified genre, will love it.

 Overhyped, one time watch, plotless

 Ironic and indulging almost complete

 Just getting stars for some suspense in end.

 Hilarious, with plot holes, good and bad twists, awesome acting!!

 Itzz messy thriller with dark humour

 Entertaining watchable drama. Only glitch, at times you should be without your logical cap.

 Good Thriller
