 A monumental film

 Depth

 Awesome follow-up with amazing visuals and groundbreaking special effects

 "Songs for great halls"

 Not a bad movie, but not as good as the other two

 Minor flaws aside, LOTR proves itself one of the most successful trilogies in modern film

 A legitimately great movie

 Tried Way Too Hard To Be Profound

 It's overrated

 this is the best movie out of all three

 A few things overlooked

 Jackson makes best of three with smart appreciation of entertainment

 A remarkable end to a classy trilogy

 The Ring's The Thing

 A great film, but something is not quite right

 "But we will meet them in battle nonetheless."

 Grade: A-

 A moviegoers dream come true

 The definition of epic fantasy

 great movie!

 a fine close to the trilogy

 Even better than expected. Too bad it's over...

 One of my favourites

 The best conclusion to a trilogy (even better than Return of the Jedi!)

 The best movie of all time
