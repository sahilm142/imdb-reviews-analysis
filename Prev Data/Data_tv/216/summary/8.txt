 Happy Valley

 Briiliant gripping crime drama

 Solid Brit Crime Drama

 Season 2, Plot Hole

 Happy Valley - Nothing Happy About it and Utterly Compelling

 Season 2, effortless ending

 Great show though there is a feminist angle

 Why have I not watched this sooner

 Entertaining but has one annoying thing.

 Season 2 Better Than Season 1

 series 1 and 2, were so engaging.

 Barneby meets Fargo

 A decent watch

 Catherine Cawood rocks!

 Ironic title

 good, but violent

 Happy valley

 Externally strong, internally fragile policewoman in a rough-and-tough environment

 Better than the average cops and robbers fare.....

 Still Another Crime Detective Series
