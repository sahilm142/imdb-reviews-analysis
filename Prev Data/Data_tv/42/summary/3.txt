 I Disagree with the Masses

 A show written for 12 year old children

 piece of crap

 If you can feel into teenagers and cheap effects you may like it

 Season 2

 I just Don't see it

 I hate to hate it

 Unbelievably Awful

 Season 2 was looooooooooooonnngg!!!!

 A retro stroll through Dullsville that's better than Ambien

 More of the same.

 TV Botulism, made for kids under the age of 10, maybe less

 Monster's Agent

 Back to the past?

 rating through time 8>7>6>4>4>3>...

 bored, boring, bored

 Very, very far from "masterpiece" (about 900 mega-parsecs)

 Full of Cliches

 Stranger Things are the reviews for this show...

 How is this a 9.3

 Stupid Characters to keep the story going

 garbage

 Don't understand the 10/10

 Overvalue

 Mildly entertaining but mediocre
