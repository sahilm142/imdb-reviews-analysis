Why is it that when a movie is boring and makes a pretense of being 'about something', we are supposed to take it more seriously than say, a comedy. This movie actually made me feel ill for movies in general. It took some time to watch another movie after this experience.
Whatever foreign-movie cliches this movie avoids, it substitutes stupidity in its place. The pouting, silent and pliable French lead is so seriously dull how can u watch her? The old man is supposed to be wise in the ways of the world and people, yet with that jaded disdain that gives him a sense of superiority. He really KNOWS people. The stuff this guy spits out is so outrageously phony and dull it's hard to keep a straight face. I suppose he is the sly fox who educates the innocent babe, never mind how false and boring it is. This is 'serious' filmmaking, remember.This movie is like a boring sculpture sitting in a vacuum-it's hard to breathe in here. Each scene seems as if carved from lead. It violates what i think is one of the rules of effective dramaturgy: Not every single scene should be dramatic. These movies are supposed to move us and make us feel something, but they only put us in a trance with their emotional sameness.
Witness Woody Allen's Interiors, another narcoleptic masterpiece of dreadful seriousness. There are scenes in both these movies which go so far in trying to be heavy and dramatic they are comic. Further, they betray the labored effects of an unimaginative writer. Is the best way to show us a character is feeling something by having them push it in our face every other stupid scene?
