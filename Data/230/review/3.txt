La Haine is the work of the arrogant. It has no story (three wasted youths bum around town all day) because the romping characters would carry the day, they assume. However the characters are extremely predictable; they are serially presented with decency or authority which they heatedly reject in identical fashion. Perhaps that is the point, but it gets tiresome after two hours. La Haine is also filled with indulgent cinematography, a "best of" of camera tricks that serve no narrative or emotional purpose (I'm thinking in particular of an extremely long inverse dolly-zoom as the trio looks over a balcony in a one minute orphan scene). There are also many interesting but completely irrelevant "lifestyle" shots of break dancing and djing; cool in their own right, but if that's what I wanted to see I'd be on youtube. But I'm here looking to learn something, and I get nothing. It presents me with the angry lives of three ghettoites with no context of how they got there or why they feel the way they do. They are just angry, though a few obvious lessons are learned (literally "hey, I guess not all cops are that bad"). I heard the ending was a tacked on shocker...I didn't watch it.
