Too much silicone, too much beefcake, too much slow-motion/stop-action with ominous music cues. It's really a shame because initially there seemed to be some potential here for some really good television. In fact, the first half of the pilot episode was pretty good. Then we are introduced to the tough prisoner on the block, a twenty-something model type who looks like she just finished a spread for Maxim. The male guards are all buff and most of the prisoners look like their make up was done by a salon. It makes suspension of disbelief kind of hard. It's good for a few laughs, none of which are intended.If you're a fan of daytime soaps this will be right in your wheelhouse.
