 Good looking series

 a crisp new show that's sure to entertain

 Fading fast

 Very entertaining series, law firm in Manhattan.

 Review of Series Premiere "Suits"

 Perfect until season 7

 Re-review two years later after my original "Extremely promising; however. . ." post.

 Good show, but they should have consulted real lawyers

 The emotional climax that was only a matter of time

 Makes me want to be a lawyer

 "I don't want to live in a world where we are not tight ...." (dialog)

 Downhill oops :(

 ENOUGH 'sh..'

 beautifully produced show about an NY law firm - not the first, won't be the last

 Highly Addictive

 horrible ending on 5th season

 Really good but can involve some "plot armour"

 A different perspective

 Very good start which later became a roller-coaster of ups and downs

 Suits Reminds me the white collar series,a genius criminal who is a good guy actually but he didn't have the choice to be good and have money at the same time

 I got hooked, the characters drew me in

 really good TV show about lawyers

 Season 6 Finally Harvey Is On The Track

 Surprisingly Good

 Unpredictable
