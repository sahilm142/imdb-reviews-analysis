 Love it or Hate it

 Intense, moody, and dark. Much better than expected.

 In a word, "awful".

 Never create what you can't improve!

 Look snazzy, but its crap.

 Compelling and Entertaining

 This remake outshines the original in every way

 Most convincing space battles ever?

 Don't whine, enjoy

 Very Pleasantly Surprised

 An update that improves the original

 Not bad at all - Starbuck is great!

 It ain't that bad!

 Actually this is great !

 As good as the original

 A Worthy Successor

 Not Bad - Spoilers

 Not Bad

 Very Well Done

 A perfect blend of most Sci-Fi available!

 Mature miniseries

 apart from the first scene, an ambitious and exciting pilot film

 Great show!

 Bloody great movie!

 Great beginning to an outstanding series
