 Victory of production over a lousy script

 A class act!!

 Nice movie but is this original

 A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Even Better

 A+ action film, C- epic

 What a sad waste

 Adequate Roman Epic

 Good summer movie but Oscar worthy?

 Overrated Entertainment for the Easily Pacified "Mob" with Dated CGI

 Gory but really good !!

 Nearly a very good film

 Potential not fully used

 peplum returns

 Predictable Spectacle

 Imperfect, but engaging and entertaining

 Overrated epic

 Great Roman Epic, Better On The Second Viewing

 Great acting and story but quite dated and formulaic otherwise.

 Powerful movie

 One-Line Review: Gladiator (7 Stars)

 brilliant movie

 Not the most historically accurate but still a good drama

 Good film!

 If i had to give this movie one word it would be "thrilling"
