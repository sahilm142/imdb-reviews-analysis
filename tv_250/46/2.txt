Nicely animated... stupidity that's what this show is. 1. Strange thing happens 2. There's a kerfuffle 3. Some how gets resolved in an odd manner 4. The end. The only reason I watched it was because I had seen on YouTube that it had similarities to Dante's inferno but that was stupidity as well, ah well at least it's nicely animated !
