 Almost 4 hours of my life I won't get back

 Not worth the 4 hours.

 Just step on a toilet seat <U+0096> everything will come back

 4 Hours too long

 Classic?

 Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America" is nothing more than a lame "Godfather" wannabe

 Bloated, Indulgent, Boring

 Another unhistorical depiction of the past

 Too long for comfort.

 Good acting and filming can't mend a poor story

 To long

 A 4-hour Long Disappointment

 Not worth the time
