***This contains spoilers*** ***look away now of you don't want spoilers*** The pilot was really good. Built interesting characters with a "requiem for a dream" feel , but for tech geeks. The 2nd episode was OK, still seemed legit , some of the characters had broken a bit but there was still a lot to work with . 3rd episode .. seriously .. what the hell. A complete break down of rationality got me thinking if the screen writers were snarfing morphine themselves. Mr robot turns out to be such a cheese. As for the explicit explicit scenes .. my god , just why?!?! From a tech head based story into the dribble of hedonism , self loathing crap where you just not sure which character you dislike the most. There are so many holes in the story that is literally seems like the people who wrote the pilot are not working on this anymore. As for how a senior at a security tech firm gets flawed by one of the most basic hacks is completely beyond me. Are they not using all safe on their personal computers? Good enough for the the "evil" company but not them. What does he even do at the company?!?! Its been a long time were i have actually gotten so frustrated watching a show. I was so keen for this series as well .
The creator seems to have ripped off huge chunks of ideas from the plots of The Matrix and Fight Club (with the Marxist BS cranked up to 11), smushed them together, and populated the world with nothing but cardboard characters and scene after scene of clichés.This show has the sensibilities of a comic book; smirking young hipsters rule the world. Everyone over 30 is an idiot and plot holes abound in the pilot alone. Among other things, I learned that if you ever want to know where a taxi is going, just call the cab company and say you left your keys in it. They'll totally tell you the car's next destination with no questions asked (as if that would help you get your keys). It's great for stalking and plot convenience.The buzz on this is empty hype. This is an utterly insipid show.Oh, and the main character's pupils are always gigantic. He looks like he's tripping balls.
The first few episodes are great. They seem realistic and plausible. Something that could happen at your local city centre.Then the whole series starts to unravel around the half way point....A murder happens that involves one of the main characters....but he simply tells the police that he's too busy to talk to them. Not bloody likely.Then it turns into a Fight Club rip off (they actually play music from the movie to make the connection).After watching the whole first season, I am extremely disappointed. I thought this was going to be a really great show. But by the end I can tell I won't watch another episode. It's just too far fetched, and stretching to make the story exciting.It has the opportunity to delve into the technical aspects of how the main character is able to hack into other people's lives, but instead it focuses on the outlandish.
Honestly, it was clear to me extremely fast what this show is all about. Story is so subtle that it feels like it was made in Soviet union 30 years ago to check how Americans are "breathing". Corporations are "evil", money is root of all bad things that happen, poor are poor because someone is exploiting them, profit has none other purpose than to destroy honest people, being indebted to someone is creditor's fault, redistribution is the key to everything. When I look at comments below, I am honestly scared. Your government is now of gigantic proportions, they are telling you who to hire, who to fire, what can you say and what you can't, what can you own, how much, and what you can't. Once free country is now 42% owned by the government (% of government spending as part of total GDP). Way is clear for USA, left, left and more left. I have a bad feeling you are knocking on the wrong door when it comes to search for the root of your problems. Remember that Americans never experienced alternative to everything that is perceived as "bad" in this show. Some of us did and I'm urging you to reconsider. You have no idea where this road you are taking will lead you...
How very disappointing... Boring, slow, uninspired. There's nothing left from the promising season 1. I believe I read somewhere online that after season 1's success the director was given full freedom on shooting season 2. The result shows he is incapable to perform without having someone to control and micromanage him. There's no story telling any more and the characters turned blunt.Script and direction is of primary school graduates. This is now an overestimated TV series, which will be easily forgotten. It should have stopped being produced, at least there would be a sweet memory left of a promising TV series. Not going to waste my time watching it any more and as another reviewer mentioned previously "I am jumping off this train" too.
Mr. Robot is a mix of Marxism and nihilism. The characters are dumb, envious, self-destructive and anti-social. Rich people are depicted as psychopaths (literally all of them) whose only purpose in life is to kill, pillage and rape. Corporations are evil and must be destroyed. And computer programmers are a bunch of sjw-tumblr types. They are irrational drug-addicts who can't be bothered to conform to social norms, but have magically acquired super-human knowledge about anything technology related. All that is missing is an appearance from Bernie Sanders. Unfortunately the writers have chosen message over content. Every episode so far has been a disappointment. From the technical perspective the show is pathetically inaccurate, but this is the last of its problems. For people who are interested in dramas in the technology world, I recommend "Halt and catch fire". It's one hundred times better.


                
Having watched the first episode hopes were high to have found a new favorite TV series to watch. Sadly the second episode went faster to a 0 than the Greek credit rating.From needless and non-credible dialog to an action deprived boring slur life of a junkie this series has quickly waned my interest. Where the pilot episode left me wanting more with real moral choices and illegal yet so right action, the second episode was just and endless chain of boredom.Hopefully the show will make either a turn to the light or the dark side of the various choices that lay ahead, otherwise I see no reason to keep watching.


                
as usual in series, season 2 fails to meet expectationsHacker is addicted to drugs and psychotic. - evil corps and security services are always working to conquer the world. - no real action than just a boring and slow process of character development to present ... really what are they trying to present? What is the set of questions that are brought for thinking here? Hackers trying to take over the world while some others try to do the same with other means?Too bad.. first season was indeed something that was working viewers interest and scaled up reactions to a dramatic end. This season we still have not seen a scenario/plot forming up rather than a presentation of each person's story.
This is the first review I've written for IMDb despite being a site user for 5+ years. The first episode of this show has promise. It wasn't great, and it wasn't perfect, but the premise of the show was interesting. Plus, who didn't love that awesome montage in the shrink's office? That was great. So we headed to episode two amidst concerns it could be getting a little too...well, mainstream media's idea of what "edgy hackers" are.It was downhill from episode 2 on. Basically, this show is a simplistic comic book version of The Matrix, Fight Club and what Hollywood thinks Anonymous is. It is not cool. It is not edgy. It is not geek culture, whatever that means anymore. Fight Club did a lot of this better and Hollywood considered that movie edgy 15 years ago. Hollywood. Which means it stopped being edgy before that. This show, in a nutshell, should be retitled "How USA's Marketing Department Created a TV Show in an Attempt Exploit "Geek" Culture to Rake In Advertising Dollars."SPOILER ALERTOur protagonist is packaged nicely in a wrapper that the Target Demographic can relate to: a guy who's above average in intelligence, suffers from social anxiety, feels like an outsider, and longs to change the world because he is disillusioned with the hypocrisy and greed of society. In some not very clever writing and via the use of not at all subtle plot devices, the opening scene shows basically what Hollywood imagines tech-savvy males age 18-49 want to see: themselves, only better.There are some interesting techniques used in this show, but unfortunately the show itself is frankly shallow and not very intelligent. Yes, talk of "the man" and socioeconomic inequality and capitalism is thrown in to make it seem smarter, in easily digestible chunks that we've all heard before. The characters are laughably unrealistic -- if you've ever spent any time in New York, you'll probably eye-roll at the overly stylized characters as well. This show is meant to be a comic book to tap into the perceived helplessness of the audience in order to get them to do two things: watch, to boost ratings, and to then do the marketing for them. What's hilarious is that this entire message of "corporate greed must fall and we outsiders can see things normals can't" is being created BY A CORPORATION.I can assure you (disclaimer: in my opinion) that USA Networks does not give a damn about the wealth gap. Nor do they care about big brother or corporate greed or the little guy. They're in this to make money. And why not? The target market of comic-book reading college educated Americans has a bucketful of disposable income to spend.It's always interesting to see hacker and geek culture portrayed on TV. But for the love of God, allowing a mainstream TV show to elicit emotional responses to injustice and bureaucracy is ridiculous and not a little ironic. It's tempting to play pretend and I get people wanting to believe in this show, to feel like they're a part of something, etc. But you're better and smarter than that, guys. Aren't you? Because if not, the real EVIL corp had already won. And you helped them do it.


                
I have watched 3 episodes now and the more i watch the more vile and empty feel. The lead character is meaningless. This is no tale of robin hood he and the main characters are a reflection of our debauchery and self obsession of the disempowered and alone, they are no different than the so called evilcorp they battle against. I hope this doesn't go any further as a series as it deepens the well of our suffering. We all want to kick it against the man but this series makes us as bad as them for right or for wrong.I can hardly tell a word he says and the only relief in all this emptiness is angela. I will watch one more episode to see what happens next and then stop. The worst series since Caprica.
When I read synopsis/plot/reviews and saw such a high rating, I believed and wanted this series to "wow"me. Well at least be interesting enough to watch. Well, I was very disappointed. I did what the entire lengthy pilot. I gave it a chance even though it didn't feel right from the get go. It's like it was created by no talent hacks on a whim. It has every cliché in the book and is painfully predictable. I watched the second episode and it went from bad to horrible. BTW, this is my genre and it is a relevant topic of today's society, but it's very poorly written and very poorly acted. Even with Christian Slater in it. I know that my review means nothing, because there are obviously thousands of IMDb users that loved it. I just had to say my piece.


                
Slow, plodding, none of the characters are likable or someone you can relate to.It tries to hard to be clever, and as a result just waste time not developing the story or the characters. Tried several times to get into it and every time I gave up because nothing happens.The premise of the show was excellent, the execution poor, spends too much time focusing on mute points and not enough happens.Also found that the majority of good things seem to be taken from other shows, e.g. researching and setting people up ala Dexter or keeping hard disk copies of his work again ala Dexter.Not sure how this show can have 8.9 in ratings as its one of those that's so boring you start questioning why your wasting your life watching this!


                
OK, so I work in security, protect networks and servers - maybe that is why I liked the first episode a lot. Damn I was looking forward to the continuation.But then 2'nd episode started slow, ended slow.From episode 3 - all have been lost and from 4 onward, just awful, violence, drop, no real focus. No red line, awful dialog, no red line, dark dysfunctional setting, dark really annoying "music" tracks to make up for lacking dialog.The people who apparently want to "save" the people who are not the 1% of the 1% of the 1% are social hackers, but I see no real technical skills.If it hard continued in the track from 1'st episode I would gladly had give a 7.
Some of us know what you're trying to do, show. We know you're just a high production-value show with arrogant artsy cinematography.They portray the perfect hero for today's young adults, he has social anxiety, doesn't care for money, is a junkie, has sex, meets the other dystopian heroes in a cool abandoned arcade, hates people but at the same is white knighting the good fight against big bad evil capitalism... in other words, a SJW.I think they hired people who understand how these TV shows work, so everything is meant to be appealing, from the plot and characters to the camera shots and flashbacks, but nothing is original, it's just a trendy device with no real identity to make people think "this show looks good, like those other shows and films".The same crappy devices used to make "Life of Pi".Oh and... when they were mocking that over-the-top hacking movie to try and make them look like ~real hackers~ in contrast... oh man, that was pathetic and laughable.
Writers should be sacked or at least taken off the Ritalin. I watched up to episode 3 of season 2. When Elliot start slagging off God and religion (how enlightened for the seventeenth century). I mean is there any other clichéd "I'm so clever I read Voltaire" BS you want to vomit on your audience?Stop trying to be clever, because you're not, and start entertaining, which you're not. If I want to hear pretentious "know it alls" spouting what they think they know then I can just venture down to my local wine bar or go on Google+ forums. If I want to be entertained with a good story then I watch a TV program. Remember who you are and forget what you think you know and get on with what your supposed to be doing: entertaining people, not alienating them with your opinions. I don't care what Elliot believes or thinks. I am not interested in his world view. I want a good conspiracy story-line, not a naval gazing session of his personal demons. It's boring and of no story telling value. He's a hacker and a nut case we all get that. Now move on with the story. Understand what you should be doing and start doing it or else you will loose your audience.


                
This was one of my worst experiences whatsoever, a total waste of time. The high scoring (8.8) is too much for this, way too much. This grading system is confusing me, I personally think it deserves a negative 8 - it was so badly thought out. Conversations - boring, characters - boring, plot - boring. I dislike it when they are trying to convince me in the originality of their ideas when, in fact, "Fight Club" already showed me a burned out man with a mental disorder fighting against "society" in an aggressive manner. What "Mr.Robot" couldn't portray (compared to "Fight Club") is the realism and the the anger that the characters felt. I see no structure in "Mr.Robot", I see modern trends like - social anxiety issues, anti-social behaviour (in a passive behind-a-monitor way), drug use (to make it more original, let's make the character take morphine through the nose, that's never shown in a TV-series before now, has it)and the spin off..oh, man, was it all a hallucination of a young troubled mind? I don't know, may be watch "Fight Club" and find out...
As per Hollywood usual men are having sex with men and every female is a closet lesbian when the opportunity arises. The direction is terrible with extremely off-center shots which some director probably thinks are edgy and stylistic. I see the same extras walking by in many outdoor scenes. They have different clothes but the same shoes. Sloppy. No effort.It's just as generic and predictable as any previous shows involving hackers, but with even more drama clichés. Sad.The music is like a poor excuse for a Jesper Kyd knock-off. Often unfitting, especially the 'rock' segments of loud and entirely unfitting music which usually gets cut off instantly.Constant mumbling and build ups to nothing, terrible things happening for the sake of luring the viewer to watch the next episode where nothing significant happens either.An obnoxious amount of filler - prolonged drone shots, mundane chatter, to fill up that 1-hour mark and waste everyone's time and life.No like-able characters whatsoever. I've lost all interest during season two. There's no one to root for in this. It's just borderline depressing for the sake of appearing 'deep'. Overdoing something won't make it better.This show is draining (and expects) too much emotional investment and none of those emotions are good. It doesn't reward with anything. No plot progression. Just one bad thing after another, no continuity, hoping that's enough to keep people watching and pretending they find it deep when it's just lazy.All of it's significance was drained in the first few episodes, now it's just the same filler repeating. If you want to be depressed over and over by the same things repeating (the 'definition of insanity' - ironically mentioned in the movie) then keep watching and wasting your time.I want to point out that Rami and Martin Wallström especially I feel are fantastic actors - in fact too good to be playing those terrible characters in this pointless show along with it's mediocre cast outside of them two.


                
For some reason Media has always had it for science and technology, regardless the fact that they rely on it on every stupid thing they produce, just like the rest of the religious community take on the same subjects. On almost every episode, tech savvy audience find it difficult to stomach the amount of rubbish being displayed as computer stuff.This is so awful it makes you sick, unless of course you are a technophobe or someone with no understanding of technology what so ever, then it may see like something to watch and fill time with. To avoid spoilers here are some pointers you may want to check: first of all computer hackers don't wear hoodies to avoid being spotted, that is simply lame and patronising beyond anything I have come across. Second, Tor browsing wouldn't allow another hacker to see the stuff you are checking on the internet unless you are using it wrong. there are so many similar errors that it is hard to say they were unintentional. In addition the way hackers are wrongly portrayed as psychologically unstable persons, though they are or think they are much smarter than other people. As well as the idea that hackers waste their time hacking individuals to gain knowledge of their histories and habits is so lame.I have no issues with Sci-Fi series or movies, to the contrary I love them, but when they attack the basics of science and technology I stand back and point out the misconceptions they are trying to sell.
I started watching this show due to the high rating on IMDb. After the 1st episode I was thinking they finally did a great show that will have huge success. But shortly after the 2nd episode the show went very quick from great to worst you can imagine. From a skillful hacker movie to a sloppy soap telenovela.It became off topic comparing to the 1st episode. For example if you are a fan of hacker movies consider watching Whoami - No System is Safe. It's a German film from 2014 who will not disappoint you.I don't think Mr. Robot can be fixed after going so far in the wrong direction. Too bad.


                
This show is trying to mimic Fight Club and Dexter obviously, but the plot is so predictable and awful. It is full of cliché, and it tried to mix Marxism/populism with the geek culture (what a terrible combination!), in a very shallow, brainless way.It is clear that the target audience of this show is those who thought that drug addict can be controlled and their debt should be just cleared.============================================= Watching it is really a waste of time.


                
I understand the demographic this is aimed at. Slacker boys, children despite being in their 20's, who are in debt up to their eyeballs and want to blame somebody else for their poor choices.Certainly, I am troubled that so much of the world's wealth is in the hands of so few people. Certainly, I understand how impossible it is to make a dent in the plutocracy. So you think I might like this – but I don't. I have no debt, for I don't spend money on stupid stuff that is advertised to me--nor indeed expose myself to ads. I watched this DVD via my public library. I'm sure the intended audience downloaded each episode for 2.99 or pays 300 bucks a month for cable or satellite. Put it on the credit card, and boo-boo it's all somebody else's fault they can't pay it off. Well, spoiled little boys, bite me. If you want to disengage from the Evil Co.s of the world, kill your TV, get a second job, pay off your debt, and quit watching this pandering nonsense to convince yourself you aren't responsible for your choices. Oh, and bite me.Did the main actor actually take morphine on each day of filming? If not, he is doing a good job of portraying that. That's all I can say positive about this mess.


                
Watching this show is a lot like eating a beef and bean burrito from 7-Eleven at 1am. The first few bites were delicious, but before you know it you're on the toilet punching through 6 inches of porcelain.Mr robot episode one was surprisingly good and lived up to all the hype that this crappy show has somehow garnered... in a way it kind of felt like Dexter in a modern, nerdy way. Everything after that first episode could be wiped with and flushed down a toilet. The show suffers from several problems. First, the main character is incredibly annoying and makes me want to punch myself in the face. Christian Slater (though great in True Romance) has similar effects. His acting is about as good as Rob Schneider and his character's persona (and accent) becomes increasingly challenging to take seriously. Next, the plot line is completely illogical and must have been scrapped together by a bunch of unemployed, heroine-addicted writers who thought this was a good idea at the time. Nothing in this show is realistic despite the fact that this show constantly strives to be 'technically accurate'. It's not. As if the show wasn't already intolerant enough, you can't go more than ten minutes without having some anti-corporation, anti-republican party, pro- liberal horse manure rammed down your throat. Despite the high ratings this show somehow received, it is crap.


                
I had enough of this show. A huge promise that ended up like a big disappointment.The show ended for me when the mister rational guy killed that woman for no reason at all. I mean, the guy had a rational method even to get rid of his frustrations (paying the beggar to get hit) and then all of a sudden makes a stupid move like that with no actual motivation and worse, the husband knew he had harassed his wife in the night before the murder, not to mention his DNA and prints were all over the lady. I also hated the evil queen stereotype of his wife. Also, what is the point of Ellyot right now?So this is it. Lots of stereotypes like the evil queen, the crazy hero and so on. Very little consistency on developing characters.The writers are pretty much lost and it seems to me the show is written on the go with no cohesion and no planning at all.Avoid it at all costs.
After watching the two seasons in agonize, i feel that i need to share my view. as a software developer in cyber security i really enjoyed the references and the knowledge they presented on the show. And nowadays where cyber crime\cyber security very popular, i really enjoyed the idea of this show.It started good, single story-line with a lot around it. BUT. after a while it became too much! from a vigilante to anarchy, relationships, mental illness, history, politics, "chinese overtake" idea, FBI, business partners ,every group there is (arab, homosexual,blonde hair "pretty girl", Afro-American, young, old etc.)and the list goes on and on.sometimes more is less and less is more.so this show became so messy, with so many layers which go to DIFFERENT directions, that every episode is on another subject. ITS ALL OVER THE PLACE.and don't think that i don't like "mindfuck"\complicated movies\shows(from death note to game of thrones).i really do. but this one tried to bring everything to the table and know i can't see my plate and what's on it.i always thought to myself, that after one season even if the show is not made so well\have it flaws - i will keep watching it because i became connected to the story. i don't believe that anymore.


                
Season 1 of this show was great. I am not sure what happened in season 2 but the show is not worth watching; a total waste of recording space on the DVR. It's a hot mess and, but for the residual merit of season 1, I'd say it must be canceled. The show is so bad and so confounded that the series now appears to include additional airings of cast, writers, whomever, just trying to explain each episode and, I presume, -thereby retain some viewers. Well, I have no interest in a show that requires absurd levels of explanation to make any sense. The plot is broken and, despite the fast paced, let's call it twitchy presentation of each episode, the story line move at a snails pace. All the nauseating repetition of a daytime soap yet completely lacking in any wit or such other potentially redeeming quality. It the writers were shooting for schizoid embolism, then they scored a bulls eye.
