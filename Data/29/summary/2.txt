 Wise Up People

 Simplistic Schlock for the Simple Minded

 Fantasy reigns supreme

 This Movie Is Way Beyond "Saving"

 Predictable

 A myopic, americentric view of the human side of war

 What a stupid movie (MILD SPOILERS)

 So it is sort of based an a true story?

 Instead of me picking this the best war film ever

 Tom Hanks outsmarts Col. Klink

 Dismal movie: Both grotesquely violent and inanely saccharine.

 A post Viet-Nam Hollywood failure (as a period film)

 too patriotic

 Don't be afraid to criticize this film! You can still be patriotic and not like it.

 Disappointing.

 30 minutes of gore followed by 120 of stupidity

 Subtle Zionist

 Vastly over-rated

 Hated it.

 Typical Spielberg Over-dramatics

 Don't bother

 No No No

 pathetic.

 Not all historic

 One great sequence does not a great or even good movie make
