Hitchcock brings the successful play, Dial M for Murder by Frederick Knott, to life in a shocking new way. Adapted by use of the amazing 3D technology.This movie is unique for Hitchcock in many ways. It is shot entirely in one room, yet there is never a moment of claustrophobia. As for many movies in the early 50's, it was shot in 3D. And you will at times notice scenes that play into that, but are done with the greatest of expertise. Also he chose not to change the play at all, but rather ride it out.As the aging tennis pro or the jealous husband, Ray Milland is solid all the way through. And what can I say about Grace Kelly. Behind only Ingrid Bergman and Donna Reed, as the most beautiful and talented actresses of all time. She never fails to impress. She can be quite a darling and at the same time a spectacular bitch.Probably my favorite Hitchcock film, since it is the first one I saw. I was introduced to him very early in life at the age of 7, by my wicked older sister. For years Psycho haunted me and Vertigo confused. But I do thank her for Notorious and Rear Window. Dial M for and North by Northwest.Seems to me that Hitch was not the most attractive guy, yet like all of us he favored beautiful women. Especially blonde's. This leads me to the question of, what does a guy like Hitchcock know about women? Maybe simply, how to kill them.


                
With "Dial M For Murder", the Master signs another classic of mystery, starring for the first time, the actress who'd become the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, Grace Kelly. And as much as I appreciated the much more acclaimed "Rear Window", I sincerely believe this is one of Hitchcock's finest achievements, which is saying a lot considering his glorious oeuvre, but "Dial M for Murder" takes a special place in my heart, because it represents for many reasons, the typical Hitchcockian film, by many standards.I. Dial M for <U+0085> MurderThe Murder takes place right in the middle of the story and like in "Psycho", it's defined by what precedes and what follows, it's the emotional reward of a patient but powerful build-up while the resolution is an intelligent case of manipulation. The build-up is the construction of a perfect crime, Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, presents to the killer, a remarkable Anthony Edwards, the killing's plan as if it was a simple technical operation, following an incredibly methodical scheme, admirably meticulous if it wasn't for the purpose of killing. Hitchcock's masterful direction creates a plot within the plot, at a point you wonder if you're watching the adapted play within a film, or a film that transcended the confined setting of the play. And the second and crucial element of the build-up subtly hints the fact that there's always a human factor that undermines any attempt of perfectionism. So, when comes the time of the murder, we have these two parameters, we know how it should happen, but we keep in mind that whatever must go wrong will go wrong. How? When? Where? This is what the whole first part of the suspense is about.II. Dial M for <U+0085> MistakeWhat could have been a lazy exercise of adaptation becomes in the hands of the Master, an extraordinary thriller confined in an elegant room sometimes welcoming, sometimes claustrophobic. The handling of the space and the various objects that occupy it, a telephone, sockets, scissors, keys, the way the camera shows them or hides them till the right moment is crucial in the way they organize what would lead to the fatal mistake. We only see what the characters can see and Hitchcock's manipulative effects consists on the way he lets the human factor affect the story only during the villainous parts. As much as we don't really care for the love story, because Christopher Hummings who plays the lover, Halliday, is probably the least charismatic of all, we sort of root for the villains, because of that 'humanity' displayed by the mistake. The point is that the murder is so well crafted, that there's a little evil voice inside us that wishes it could work, but again, this is Grace Kelly, and the sight of that creature in danger immediately reverses the rooting process, and then while her hands desperately seek a providential help, one pair of scissors theatrically conclude the heart of the film and the ruthless killer, becomes a worthless killer, before falling as a victim, or a collateral damage at best. The mistake is not just a plot device, it's Hitchcock's cynical insertion of humanity in a rather cold and emotionless mindset.III. Dial M for <U+0085> ManipulationThere's an interesting trivia about the title's translation in French: "The Crime Was Almost Perfect", which conveys the inevitability of human factor like fate in Greek tragedies. It is, no pun intended, the key element of the evolution and resolution of the plot, when Wendice will exploit the mistake to his advantage. Tony Wendice is impressive, because he's simply predicted everything, and he puts the level so high, that even Halliday couldn't accuse him, although, in the way he deconstructed the murder when trying to convince Wendice to find an alibi to save his wife Margot from execution, he concluded on what could have been the true motive of the murder but he was not in the same caliber than his opponent, hence the entrance of Detective Hubbard, played by an elegant, suave and scene-stealing John Williams. And it's only justice, that he could outfight Wendice by using his very weapon, manipulation. It's all about manipulating objects, space and people and on that level, Wendice found his archenemy.IV. Dial M for <U+0085> MillandRay Milland is perfect as the quintessential upper class villain, elegant, sophisticated and absolutely and totally unflappable, and I use the word 'perfect' as the reference to the French title. A perfect murder needs a perfect villain whose perfect scheme wouldn't be undermined by any external factor, except something under his own control. The casting of Milland also works because he's the one who outshines the other characters, his wife is the victim, the man he hires also appear as the victim, when he tries to kill Grace, you can look on his eyes, that he was a 'casting' error, Milland also underestimated his wife's strength as she managed to overcome her fear and become the killer. But Milland is the only one who doesn't change, totally unflappable, he's the pillar of the film, and the film is so confident that even when he's caught, he doesn't flinch an eye.V. Dial M for <U+0085> MelodramaThe film also allows to insert some melodramatic elements to engage our sympathy toward the couple, but it's clear that this just works as the foil to justify the murder, and inspire some sympathy toward Milland, when you see him with Margot, all in white, in the opening scene, then she's wearing a bright and dazzling red dress with Halliday. In one minute, Hitchcock masterfully highlighted the treachery that would inspire Tony's crime. The love will be Halliday's motive to fight for innocence but again, it's only with the same weapons that Wendice could've been defeated.<U+0085> so whether it's for murder, manipulation, Milland or melodrama, you know you'll dial a definite M for <U+0085> Masterpiece.
Everyone loves Hitchcock. This one is my favorite. "Rear Window" and objectively speaking probably half a dozen others are better but this film is for me. Ray Milland plays a tennis player in the cruel old days when it was not good enough to be good at something. His wife got the money. Grace Kelly did not need much acting talent to play a boring woman but this is not why Ray wants to get rid of her. She falls in love with another man - Ray Cummings of all people. This casting is of course the reason why this film works. We are supposed to sympathize with the greedy husband and at the same time the wife has to be an angel. Very difficult but Hitchcock succeeds. And mainly because we cannot forgive her for even thinking of giving up her husband for a man like him. Still, at the crucial time when she is about to be strangled our sympathies shift to her. We want her to reach the scissors.And then we admire Ray Milland again and hope he will make it. His eyes are the most wonderful thing in the movies. It is a great pity that he played only in a few good ones even after "Lost Weekend". This is one of the few thrillers that can be watched over and over again. One drawback of course is that after a while you start thinking about the acting and the great directing and the simple pleasure of watching a good movie shifts to the background. This is true for all great films except for the greatest of them all like GWTW or "Thief of Bagdad" that can be watched a hundred times and still be seen like the first time -where you just enjoy the story.


                
***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** for me, this movie is hitchcock's best. everything is high above average, the cast, the directing, the plot, the screenplay, the cinemathography, the music and the whole movie. movie is abot a man (ray milland) who wants to kill his wife (grace kelly) because of two reasons, one is the money he will inherit and the other is because he discovered that his wife is in love with a novelist writer (robert cummings). milland deviously convince an ex-classmate (anthony dawson) to kill his wife while he is in a party with cummings. but dawson fails to kill kelly and himself is killed by her with scissors. things begin to get rough for milland and then he elaborate a very complex plan to blame his wife for the murder of dawson. the movie goes along with the police investigation and how the inspector (john williams) and cummings begin to suspect of milland.ray milland gives an excellent performance. this is the best performance by grace kelly (second is her role in "REAR WINDOW"). cumming gives his best role ever (although he is still wooden faced). dawson is outstanding as the forced murderer and john williams is unforgivable as the extremely british chief inspector.hitchcock directed this movie with all his stamina, each shot is a piece of art.  an epic scene is when grace kelly is judged. the stuff about the scissors is very creative and the whole picture is like a very real dream. in this movie you will have to think a lot because the plot is sometimes complicated, but i think this is a good point."SPOILERS AHEAD"special mention to the reaction that milland has when the police discovered his trick. 10/10.
After all the previous reviews, what can one add? Simply that I adore this film, see it again and again, always with the same delight, never getting tired of it. Curiously, though, it does not seem to me like a typical Hitchcock film... There is not a "good guy" fighting some "bad guys". The hero is a cold blooded schemer, who wants to murder his wife, but she is not so innocent herself, since she has a secret affair with another man, while her lover comes into their house seemingly as a friend, but is determined to make her leave her husband. There are no action filled scenes, the story is confined within the couple's house, and all is done with the utmost politeness and keeping of appearances. There is no "murderer", because the one that commits the actual killing does so in self defense.And yet, we are watching with undiminished interest, to see what will happen next. All the fascination emanates from the "plan", the setting, the idea, the master mind that orchestrates the crime scene,like a director does his movie, only his "actors" play it differently from what he had arranged. He swiftly opts for an alternative plan, and concludes his "scenario" with success, until a police inspector with unorthodox methods finds the loose end, the small detail that leads to the truth... At least 80% of the film's value is due to the performance of Ray Milland, he is pure perfection in his portrayal of the ex champion, the sportsman who organizes his last game, and almost wins the bet... I am very much surprised that he did not get a second academy award for this one, it really shows how unfair the whole system is. It is impossible to point out any favorable scenes, as he is brilliant from the first to the very last moment he is on screen. I especially love, though, the little scene when he hides Margot's handbag behind his back in order to steal her key , while she clings to him, so as to prevent him , both laughing while they struggle... Grace Kelly was very very beautiful in this film, more girlish and sexy than in any of her other roles, not at all like her usual sophisticated and coolly aristocratic self. With Ray Milland they made such a charming couple, that one is almost disappointed that things did not work well for them in the film. If only Tony had a way of knowing that Margot had decided to abandon her ex lover and stay with her husband, the story would have a totally different end! In such a case we would have a romantic film instead of a thriller, but I would surely love such a happy end! Something else that should be said is that Tony would not get the death penalty for what he did, because he did not actually kill anyone, he just PLANNED a murder that did not take place in the end, so he would probably be out after one year or so... I trust that he would be able to make a new life for himself quite easily after that! A film that has no need of any recommendation, its value is well established over the years, but I give mine just the same, as well as 10 points out of ten.
When you watch this movie it's impossible not to feel that Alfred Hitchcock was a genius! Whether it's a thriller like "North by North west" where the viewer is taken half-way across America, or an espionage movie that treks across Europe in "Foreign correspondent" or just simply a plain case of mistaken identity in the "The wrong man", Hitchcock was always able to find the right tempo, atmosphere and chemistry for his films. It's hard to imagine a simple stage play being transformed into a Hollywood box office hit, because with the exception of one or two short scenes, the entire movie takes place in a confined environment of a ground floor flat in Maida Vale London. Not surprisingly Hitchcock does not disappoint and is able to pull it off by producing a highly entertaining film!It is a well written story with great dialog between the characters, but it is the tension, the incidental music and the camera angles that make this movie compelling viewing. Needless to say the movie was blessed with some big box office draws of the day in Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and Ray Milland, with fine support from Hollywood based Brits character actors Anthony Dawson and John Williams. I'm not suggesting that Dial M for murder is Hitchcocks best movie, the best of course is a subjective viewpoint, but the lead character here Tony Wendice who plays the villain, a washed up former tennis pro is probably Hitchcocks most diabolical killer. I say that because he is not deranged or violent but cold and calculating, he is able to personify evil in an easy-going and matter of fact way. For example not only does he really enjoy blackmailing Swan but takes great pleasure in detailing the way he plans to kill his wife and get away with it. In addition you can see that he is proud of the meticulous planning and ruthless dedication that has gone into this. What's fascinating about the character is that when he gets home and finds Swan dead rather than panic he does some quick thinking, takes advantage of that and is able to stitch up his wife Margot for Swans killing. With his marital woes now behind him (his wife going to the gallows) and the only person who knows other wise unable to talk you can see that he is pretty pleased with himself. Things couldn't have worked out any better for him and he even starts spend the cash he did not have to pay Swan. Even at the very end, a very nonchalant Wendice just casually pores himself a drink as if he had just come in from work. Watching him is like watching water of a ducks back, you'll simply never see Ray Milland in a better role!Robert Cummings plays crime writer Mark Halladay who is Margots lover, and Grace Kelly plays Margot who comes across as mostly bewildered the whole time, even before the attempt on here life. John Williams plays police inspector Hubbard who at first one just dismisses as an eccentric dunce. Initially you underestimate him and wonder if he is in over his head, but as his role becomes more prominent you realize that he is smarter than he looks and is way ahead of Wendice as things unravel. Lot's of twists and turns as you would expect from a Hitchcock movie and despite some obvious legal problems with the crowns case against Margot, it's well worth a watch! (Note: even if the initial crime had been successful and Swan had been able to extricate himself from the flat the police might have been puzzled why there was no wet footprints, grass or mud on the carpet bearing in mind that the garden was wet and that was the way he had meant to have gained access?)
Watching it in 2017- a 63 year old film and being mesmerized by the concept, theme, acting, directing, and all the stuff of this brilliantly fabulous movie.All the actors (Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, Anthony Dawson, John Williams) were absolute class on their respective characters. I just wish I could go back to those days to have the experience of those beautiful days. Everyone should watch this masterpiece. I know that most of today's viewers prefer movies having nudity or "f" words or sexuality, but a true movie lover must watch class films of yesteryear, and this one is certainly one of them.


                
This has to be in the top 10 of Alfred Hitchcock's cluster of masterfully directed classic films. In her first teaming with The Master, Grace Kelly portrays a wealthy woman married to a fading tennis pro (Ray Milliand), who wants her murdered, because he knows of her affair with an American writer (Robert Cummings). Nicely shot in color, with a robust musical score, the picture was designed for 3-D, and the effects are quite minimal until the attempted murder scene, by a hired thug (Anthony Dawson). Later, due to Milland's interfering, Kelly becomes the accused, until a savvy detective (John Williams) unravels the case. Ray Milland is again simply superb, reciting fine dialog with great relish, while Kelly is startling beautiful and polished, until things begin to go awry....her hair and clothes become drabber. Stagy, mostly in one indoor set, even the outdoor London sets seem projection-oriented, but always gripping, fascinating, and nerve-wracking.


                
One of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies,and one of the best movies of all time.Dial M for Murder is indeed about the perfect murder.What I personally like about Hitchcock's movies is the simplicity of the places where the movies are shot.In Rear Window is just a flat and a garden,in Lifeboat is,well just a lifeboat and so on.In Dial M for Murder the whole action happens in just one room,but the simplicity of the decor is compensated with the complex story.Another thing that makes Hitchcock's movies so awesome is that you never now for sure how the movie will end,until it ends.This adds a great tension to the movie that keeps the viewer in his chair until the end of the movie.All in all,the plot,the actors and of course the Director make Dial M for Murder a great mystery thriller that should,in my opinion,be rated as one of the best movies of all time and stay in the IMDb 250 top somewhere in the top 10 in the beginning of the list,not at the bottom.


                
For me, the whole point of the movie was Ray Milland (as Tony Wendice)planning in detail the murder of his wife, Margot(Grace Kelly). The chilling way Milland explains to Swann the why and how of the details for murder. No one has ever captured the pathology of murder the way Alfred Hitchcock did in this movie with Ray Milland. (I can't see Cary Grant--apparently considered as an alternative for Tony Wendice--performing at the same level as Milland.) And Milland brought to the role a unique set of vocal talents that was perfect casting for a pathological killer. Almost a monotone with his demonic concern for the crime. Good looks and charm that prohibits him from looking like a pathological killer. Even at the end of the film where all is revealed--what does he do, he makes himself a drink and offers a drink to Margot, Mark, Chief Inspector Hubbard...So the movie really isn't about Margot, after an attempted strangulation, having strength to thrust scissors through a trench coat, a woolen sport coat--to reach a vital organ for a near fatal thrust. It is not even about solving the 'crime'. It not about the Hitchcokian macguffin of the key.The movie is really a character study of a pathological killer; and Ray Milland fulfilled the role with excellence.
What I have read here in some reviews is unbelievable. Five stars? Four stars?!? Three stars???!!!? Are you kidding or what? I rarely got stuck to the screen from beginning to end like in this movie, the personal stories of the characters are deliberately put in the background because it's a thriller not a love story, the fact that you do not even realize that the whole movie is shot in one scene is a merit of the great Hitchcock not a point to the disadvantage, it is all focused on the story and on the convoying of the viewer and the success is total. There are no significant discrepancies or unreal situations unless you want to find them on purpose. In short, this is an absolute masterpiece of the movie history and those who criticize it want to ask itself a level of superiority that does not belong to it.


                
I'm surprised it's Rating was just 8.2, It should have been more than that. Awesome movie..!!!


                
A great movie about a murder plot executed by perfection by Alfred Hitchcock with clever and interesting dialogue. It is tense, suspenseful and exciting for its whole run time even though the movie takes place mostly in one location. A legendary masterpiece by one of the best directors of all time.


                
Its starts with a man who decides to murder his wife because she had an affair the year before. He blackmails an old college associate to strangle her. But things don't go according to plan and then he has to come up with a brilliant plan B. This is certainly the best Hitchcock thriller that I've seen. The whole story remains right before our eyes without any plot holes. It has the capability to keep its audience on the edge of their seats throughout the 105 minutes running time.


                
I just watched the DVD version of "Dial M for Murder" again last night. It looked as good as ever, maybe even better than ever! Grace Kelly was so young and so beautiful, and gave Hitch a very inspired performance. She was a great actress and they obviously worked well together! All the other major actors give the performance of their careers as well. Brilliantly done and very satisfying entertainment. Interesting that it appears to be the last major film for both Robert Cummings & Ray Milland, who went on to many TV shows, occasional B movies, and guest appearances. Even Dimitri Tiomkin delivered a very inspired score. While he was great at major themes and grand action music, he seems to ramble pointlessly in minor action scenes ("The High & the Mighty" is a case in point. Some of the background music for the cabin action scenes seems pointless and unnecessary.) But...not in this case! He delivers a very inspired score that fits the film perfectly! (His last score for Hitch, by the way). Watch it again, you won't be disappointed (I guarantee...)!! Regards, Steve


                
Dial M For Murder is Hitchcock doing what he does best- building suspense and climax. It is the fourth film I have seen from him, and once again, he does not disappoint. The film is built upon a cleverly staged crime, one that can be called the 'perfect' crime, but like we all should know, no crime is perfect. The screenplay works very well, and is definitely it's strong point. Hitchcock is also the master for this kind of film, and the film is never boring for one second. Ray Milland and Grace Kelly are both superb, probably the best performances I have seen from a Hitchcock film together with Anthony Perkins. I am pleased to say that this is another classic film and I shall continue seeking out Hitchcock!


                
If you read Patricia Highsmith's novel STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, it does differ from the film version that Alfred Hitchcock made. Guy, his tennis pro hero, actually does become quite close to Bruno, and at the end confesses to the murder of his wife (after Bruno dies). The hint of homosexual attraction between Farley Granger and Robert Walker in the film (mostly due to Walker's performance) is allowed to go so far, but the conclusion is firmly on heterosexual grounds. Granger goes off with Ruth Roman at the end. It was 1951, and you did not show a favorable eye towards gay lovers.But it has been pointed out that in a strange way, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is like an introduction to DIAL "M" FOR MURDER. Guy is a tennis pro (which is how Bruno recognizes him to begin with). He is romancing (although still married, if estranged) Ruth Roman, the daughter of a wealthy U.S. Senator played by Leo G. Carroll. So his marriage is one of potentially great social importance to Guy. The marriage of aging tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) to his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) is to a wealthy fan. They are living in an expensive flat in one of London's most posh sections. But the marriage is souring on Milland's part - he has found that she has been having an affair with family friend novelist Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). This is too much for Milland's pride (which has suffered from his physically forced retirement from tennis into working in the corporate world - and living off Margot's money). So he decides he has to kill her. One wonders if Guy's marriage would have done better.Frederick Knott's tight little melodrama can still be revived with a set of good actors and good direction. In fact, it was remade into two television versions and another movie (in 1998) with Michael Douglas in the Milland role. But Milland's smiling, plausible villain is one of his best performances - a toss-up between this role and his Devil in ALIAS NICK BEAL as to which villain was a better performance. He is in complete control of the "game" until the last fifteen minutes when he is finally tripped up by John Williams' Inspector Hubbard, who finally pieces together the mystery of the flat key (you will have to watch the film to understand).Some of the best moments are between Milland and subsidiary villain Anthony Dawson (Captain Lesgate / Swann), who is blackmailed into agreeing to be Milland's agent in his plot against the unfaithful Margot. An example of the dialog between the two scoundrels is shown on this thread, with Lesgate finding he can't scare Wendice into dropping the scheme and letting him alone. The whole sequence has to be seen - especially as Wendice keeps wiping off surfaces Lesgate touched during the scene...no fool our Tony! Hitchcock's film is usually shown in regular film stock, but he shot it also in 3-D. Unlike INFERNO there is little that is original in his use of 3-D (he probably did not know what to do with it). But in one of the critical scenes, wherein Grace Kelly is defending herself, he shows how 3-D can...err drive home a point about violence. It's one that is effective too.
This is a true Hitchcock movie about a flawed murder plan and suddenly, the man behind it tries to hide the evidence. Hitchcock has outdone himself once again and I don't see why it's not one of the 250 top-list. An action-packed thriller that glued me to my chair. I couldn;t stop watching it! Dial M for Murder is wonderful and I will be looking forward to Rear Window. If you have any comments for me, please e-mail me at tylerripen@yahoo.com.


                
Disclaimer: Dial M For Murder is my second favorite movie of all- time, but I will attempt to write an unbiased review of the film. In 1954, Alfred Hitchcock made what I believe to be a perfect film (that didn't take long) that he apparently thought nothing of. In the book Hitchcock, by the equally as brilliant Francois Truffaut, Hitch admits that he was playing it safe with this movie and didn't put much effort into it as wasn't especially invested. That was a bit of a buzzkill, considering what the movie means to me, however, whether he was trying too hard or not, Hitch made a great one with Dial M For Murder. Starring Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, Dial M For Murder explores the plot of a man desperate to murder the wife he finds out has been having an affair. An example of one of the most brilliant storytelling films I have ever seen, Dial M For Murder is cemented in the heart of this Hitchcock fan, whether he would like that or not.Margot Wendice (Grace Kelly) is the beautiful socialite wife of tennis great Tony Wendice (Ray Milland). During one of Tony's tennis tours, Margot began an affair with an American writer, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). The brief, passionate affair was enough to stay in the minds of the adulterers long after Tony's tennis tour was complete and they were back home in London. Margot and Mark began corresponding with love letters back and forth for several months until Margot decided to end the affair when Tony announced he was going to retire from professional tennis. Unbeknownst to Margot, Tony had intercepted one of the couple's letters and decided to give up his tennis life in order to wholly devote himself to his wife. This devotion inspired Margot to fully invest herself in their marriage as well, thus severing ties with Mark. Upon a visit, Margot invites Mark to her home for a night out with her and Tony in order to share with him that one of their letters, that which was intercepted by Tony, has been used against her as a form of blackmail. Conversely, Tony begins to hatch a plan to rid himself of his two-timing wife so he can inherit her sizable fortune. After months of trailing a schoolmate of his from college, and realizing he has fallen upon hard times, Tony seizes the opportunity to blackmail him into murdering his wife. The grand scheme is to occur on the night Mark is in town, ironically providing Tony the perfect alibi. Tony soon finds out that no matter how careful and calculating one is, there is no such thing as the perfect murder. Ray Milland, be still my heart; was there ever an actor who more perfectly delivered lines than this specimen? I only half type that in jest as MIlland's line execution is brilliant and commanding of the dialogue driven film. The storytelling in this film is so wonderfully perfect, the audience feels like a participant rather than a spectator. The entire film weaves a beautifully perfect puzzle in which each piece comes together to create a brilliant example of filmmaking. I love a one-setting film, and after watching and enjoying Lifeboat and Rope, it is clear that the master of suspense is uniquely talented in making one-setting films quite well. Some wonderful overhead shots allow the audience to understand that Tony sees himself as a God-like figure manipulating the lives of those around him to fit his agenda. The colors are also a brilliant piece of Dial M For Murder. The audience is stricken by Grace Kelly and her gorgeously vibrant red dress at the beginning of the film, with her outfits colors growing strikingly darker throughout the film, allowing one to see that Hitchcock may have been gaining inspiration for his most known film, Psycho while making a film he thought nothing of (I promise I'm not too bitter). Turning out Dial M For Murder, the accidental perfection, and Rear Window, the more commonly believed near perfection; I am reasonably certain that 1954 was Hitchcock's best year.


                
Another excellent Hitchcock film, just one of the many that the director made which exceeded all my expectations. This murder mystery has a twist - we know the identity of the culprit from the start, it's just a question of waiting to see whether the cast work it out or not. The film takes place in a single location, a low key apartment, much like the Audrey Hepburn thriller WAIT UNTIL DARK. It's a slow paced and talky affair with an absolutely intricate plot that's likely to tie you up in circles if you don't watch it closely enough, but of course that's part of the fun.Personally, I thought the script was superb - one of the best, ever. Every little detail has been worked out and even if there are a couple of weak explanations along the way, you can easily forgive them thanks to how enjoyable watching the twists and turns play out is. The clever title refers to the pivotal scene, a sterling set-piece of suspense and murder, in which the lovely Grace Kelly is menaced by a sinister thug. Ray Milland is the deliciously slimy anti-hero and I love his stiff upper lip and confident air of self-assurance that propels him along throughout the movie. John Williams, a carry-over from the stage play on which this is based, supplies the much-needed comic relief and Anthony Dawson is as delightfully sinister as he's ever been.The fun from this film comes from watching Hitchcock ratchet up the suspense in numerous unexpected ways - such as the simple turning of a key in a lock. There isn't a cliché in sight, just strong plotting and decent scriptwriting. I even enjoyed this over the Hitchcock film I watched previously, NORTH BY NORTHWEST; it's one of those films where I wouldn't change a thing. I know I'm gushing, but this is a real treat. NB. I've recently re-watched this film in 3D, but that aspect is almost needless, merely adding depth to a few sequences; there's only one stand-out bit (during the attempted murder) so I wouldn't go to the trouble, personally.
In usual fashion, Hitchcock takes a simple one room setting and injects a complex plot to a simple murder act. The scheme and collusion between two former college acquaintances is just too coincidental but brilliant.I think that in terms of performance the credit goes to John Williams as the police inspector who led people on to think that that he knew less than what the truth was. As always Grace Kelly just mesmerizes you with simple beauty, charm and of course grace. And the murder plotter played by Ray Milland was simply fantastic with his bold yet reserved concern for how this murder would actually play out. Mark played by Robert "Bob" Cummings adds quiet humor to saving his lovers life by actually suggesting the premeditated plot that the husband really wanted to carry out.The suspense is concluded with collaborated work by both the inspector, Mark, Grace and surprisingly the husband who actually convicts himself unknowingly. Great viewing for Hitchcock fans and viewers of murder mystery thrillers.
This was the first Hitchcock film I has seen, and absolutely loved it. The call, seeing the internal connection. I thought it had a great storyline, especially Ray Millands character. Fast, smart, convincing, menacing, methodical, careful. Really love that role. I just can't get over his fast thinking.Directing style with movement if the camera and crane shots really capture the peoples perspective. Along with perspective shots of Milland's quick hands.Ray Milland is smooth and suave--a far cry from his character in The Lost Weekend. Grace Kelly is all elegance and, well, grace. It's play-to-screen and 90% of the movie takes place in one room. It's a murder gone awry and in the 50s British tradition we follow the clues through the efforts of Robert Cummings, Grace's ex-lover and a crime writer and John Williams, the Scotland Yard detective assigned to the case. British crime thrillers are so unlike their French or American counterparts and the lack of emotional affect enhances rather than detracts. Dial M was remade into The Perfect Murder just a few years ago but the remake is not much like the original and not that good. A Perfect Murder is a perfect example of what Hollywood and two big stars can do to muck up something understated and clever and really suspenseful
"Dial M for Murder" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about a man that organizes a "perfect murder" for his wife with an accomplice. An important distinction between this and other Hitchcock films is that mystery and suspense come not from attempting to ascertain what is happening, but rather if any of the characters can discover the details of a crime the audience has witnessed.Ray Milland is Tony Wendice, the man organizing the crime. Milland is well-suited to his role as a man calculating and resourceful. Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and Anthony Dawson are solid in their roles as well. However, my favorite performance comes from John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Williams skillfully presents a subtle characterization that gradually makes a transition from easily dismissed to commanding.Though I generally prefer films with mysteries to be solved to those where the crime is known to the audience but not the characters, this film's story is tense and engaging. There are a number of interesting twists in the story that keep it interesting. "Dial M for Murder" is an excellent mystery and suspense film from Hitchcock.


                
Recently shown on cable tv(well done Cinemax)this is about the 3rd or 4th time I have seen this classic and never tire of it; would you believe it is 50 years old?! Brilliant story of a husbands' plot to murder his wife and the detective work following that. Excellent acting, script, direction and sets makes this movie compelling throughout. Anyone wanting to know how to create a great film should see this one! 10 out of 10.


                
The great master himself, Alfred Hitchcock, wasn't the biggest fan of this picture. While it doesn't compare to the complexity of the likes of Vertigo or North By Northwest, it's the brilliant simplicity that sets Dial 'M' For Murder apart from most other Hitchcock films. Taking place mostly in a small apartment, Hitchcock builds the suspense through the claustrophobic environment and that way that he deals us enough information to follow the plot, while keeping the real important cards close to his chest so that it's difficult to guess what's coming next. The film never has you sweating on the edge of your seat as you desperately try to guess what's coming next as some Hitchcock films have done; but Hitchcock still manages to achieve tension through his relaxed plotting, and that shows what an adept technician the man really was. The plot has the usual Hitchcock murder formula, and it follows a man and a plot to murder his wife. He blackmails an old collage buddy into doing the deed for him. After that plan goes awry, our villain sees an opportunity to turn the situation to his advantage again...but there's no such thing as 'a perfect murder'.The film has a cast of only five main members, and this helps the claustrophobia of the film, while ensuring that it's easy for the audience to know where they are with all the cast members. Grace Kelly is the biggest name on the cast list, and while her performance is a little too one-note, and she isn't given much to do; it's always a pleasure to see this classic actress in a movie. Starring opposite her is the excellent Ray Millard, who manages to achieve a great sense of underlying evil with his performance as Kelly's murderous spouse. It's Millard that really makes the film, and he was the perfect casting choice for the central role. My favourite performance in the movie, however, isn't from the leads; but from the excellent John Williams as the Chief Inspector. Whether it was intended or not, Williams brings great comic relief to the film and also manages to capture the essence of the great detectives such as Sherlock Holmes with his rather small part in the film. The plot is intricate and well thought out, and it will require thought to aptly grasp exactly what conspired. While Dial 'M' For Murder isn't Hitchcock's best film - I rate it among the best, and it comes with high recommendations!
