Innocent is truly a gem and it immediately succeeds in characters,scenes, twists etc. from the very beginning. It is a story gripping you initially and never letting you at the end of each episode. The script is totally convincing and intriguing and so is the cast. I really loved the tone and mood of the series. I believe one would enjoy the music too. The acting of great actor Haluk Yavuzer adds depths to the show. All in all, I would highly recommend this TV series to everyone looking for something new, genuine and captivating.
