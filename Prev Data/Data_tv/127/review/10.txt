Peep Show should be watched, studied and enjoyed many times through out for anyone who loves to laugh, love and get a hint as to how to write a well scripted comedy. The characters, the writing and the format is all so original and hilarious. I watch this show probably every day. There is always something new to discover watching and I just fall more in love with the characters each time. Although I am a single female living in America in her late 20's, I had no idea I could have so much in common with a couple of male Brits. The inner monologue is dead on and the emotions are raw but total human. Brilliant. Brilliant.Brilliant.


                
By chance I caught this show on BBC America while channel surfing thru the million channels on my cable service. Needless to say this show is funny as hell, the camera angles are used to great effect as well.The two loser roommates and their insane exploits are bizarre, yet situations that I'm sure many people can relate to. The 2 protagonists are often left dealing with paranioa, anxiety, latenet homo-sexual thought, among other things. The one roommate works in a borish office, while the second roommate is lost in a world of fantasy, with his band that's not really a band since he does not actually write music or play gigs.This show rocks!


                
Outstanding - laugh out loud - comedy. When you compare this to stuff like 3 non blondes, it is difficult to believe that they are allegedly in the same genre. BBC3 take note - this is what comedy is - it makes you L A U G H.Very funny, characters are brilliant and it just gets better and better.Along with Mighty Boosh, Nathan Barley and Dark Place, this is one to watch if you get a chance. Yes the Office is arguably the best, but these all run it close.Season 4 please!


                
This has to be the most funniest British comedy I have ever watched! The characters are so hilarious, and very likable! Each episode will always have it's really funny bits, along with a hilarious situation! The deep inner thoughts of Mark and Jeremy(the main duo of Peep Show)are dark and witty.It's just how "in-convenient" the duo's lives are, that make you want to laugh. Every moment is funny, whether it's Mark chasing his crush/obsession Sophie, or Jeremy lounging about the flat doing F*** all.If you haven't seen this in-genius comedy, then WATCH it right away! Or you won't know what your missing. -- Peep Show : No better comedy! --


                
For some time friends were telling me that I'd love Peep Show, but I never seemed to catch it on TV. However the other week I was able to see pretty much all of Series One/Two/Three on DVD and I'm happy to say these friends were correct.Classic 2 blokes Mark and Jez living togehter, holding each other back comedy, which we've seen many a time but a great touch hearing what each one is thinking (usually contradicting what they are saying) Good supporting cast help and it's fair to say that this comedy often hits the all too rare 'laugh out loud' funny.As is the recent fashion since 'The Office' relies heavily on 'cringe' factor but you'll be laughing more than not. The humour is often social anxiety and sexual, but is not afraid to descend (thankfully) to the wonders of basic toilet humour.Observe and laugh!


                
'Peep Show' is a British sitcom written by Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, starring comedy duo David Mitchell and Robert Webb, who work alongside each other in different projects in a similar fashion to other British comedy duos such as Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The show follows two men who share a flat together, Mark Corrigan (Mitchell) and Jeremy Osbourne (Webb).The shows comedy is very dark and cringeworthy and contains themes regarding sex and drugs so it's definitely not for kids but its a very guilty pleasure for everybody else. What sets this apart from similar awkward situation comedies is that the show is constantly shot from the characters' point of view, whether it be the two main characters or supporting characters and we can hear Mark and Jez' thoughts. This is a truly brilliant innovation and lifts this high above most other sitcoms, especially as the two leads are highly insecure and conniving, a lot of the time they say things only for you to hear their conflicting true thoughts and its absolutely hilarious, they often talk themselves into bizarre and embarrassing situations.Mark and Jez seem very different but they fit together well. Mark is a semi-successful, middle-class loan manager who owns the flat he lives in with Jeremy, while he seems sensible and cautious on the outside he is actually quite impulsive and occasionally talks himself into erratic behaviour he later regrets. He is highly neurotic and worries about anything, even socialising with other humans which doesn't come easily to him, he researches subjects he has no interest in just to fit in with the crowd and endures activities others enjoy. Strangely though you can identify with him and feel sorry for him, he is essentially a good person but often makes stupid mistakes in an effort to make himself look 'normal'.Jez on the other hand is far more out-going and sexually promiscuous, unemployed throughout most of the series he claims to be 'in the music industry' although his band is going nowhere and he appears to be deluded into thinking fame and fortune is waiting to come to him without him making any effort. He is Mark's only real friend but is often spiteful and malicious and seems to be constantly holding Mark back, the reason for this however seems to be Jez' fear of losing Mark rather than him actually disliking him, when things are at their lowest he always sticks by Mark and the selfishness disappears showing he isn't a completely nasty character. Jez is also a recreational drug user and is often seen hungover or on a 'downer', there are indications to Jez having bisexual tendencies as well although he often represses those feelings.The first series starts with Mark and Jez both single with Jez having just ended a longterm relationship with his girlfriend Big Suze to move in with his old pal Mark. While Mark pursues work colleague Sophie Chapman (Olivia Colman) somewhat obsessively, Jez begins seeing an attractive American with a hippy attitude, Nancy (Rachel Blanchard).The supporting cast in Peep Show are as strong as the leads, in particular Jez' friend and bandmate Super Hans (Matt King), a walking chemistry set who never met a pill he didn't pop or a pipe he didn't toke, every sentence that leaves Super Hans' mouth is an instant classic quote, a lesser show would miss such a great character but this doesn't due to its high quality and leaves him on the sidelines to great effect. Paterson Joseph plays Mark's boss Alan Johnson, supremely confident he comes across as the black James Bond, cool, calm and collected at all times. Finally Neil Fitzmaurice plays Jeff Heaney, Mark's nemesis and love rival to Sophie, he is a bully who torments Mark with sarcastic comments to put him down in front of others. Other minor characters come and go but these three really add a lot to the show.Over the course of the six series, nothing really gets any better for Mark and Jez and they are destined to spend the rest of their life together wallowing in mediocrity, stumbling from one excruciating situation to the next. Quite how this truly great masterpiece of a sitcom hasn't caught on is beyond me, perhaps due to its much darker theme than shows like The Office and the fact its been shifted to a late slot on Channel 4 it's been overlooked and while that's criminal it just means those of us who do know about it can enjoy it all the more, because it's our little secret. For me its the best sitcom of the last decade and that's saying something.


                
I joined just to post this message. Brilliant comedy that gets better the more you watch it. I've watched all 7 series 5 times and I've only been a fan for the past 2 years. I don't normally ever re-watch anything.Its available on 4OD and SeeSaw, you can watch all 7 series, and all of them are great. It might take you a little while to get into, but once you are, you will be hooked.As I write I think series 8 has been commissioned, which will put Peepshow as one of the longest running sitcoms in Channel 4 History. I think the only one that ran longer was Desmonds.If you like good quality, smart comedy, then you must watch this!


                
This show is a riot, I've only recently started watching peep show and its absolutely hilarious, think narrative with no sensors, and just witty humor that you can really see yourself thinking while in conversations with.. well just about anyone really.Mark and Jeremy are 2 blokes going about their daily routines, now to say that the're cynical wouldn't exactly be quite right but lets just say the have just the right amount of worldly view to make this an amazing show. The situations in it come up to such a degree of normalcy that you can literally imagine something like this happening in your everyday life, which makes everything that much better since it brings a sense of realizing to the show, and since there's a rare first person view camera dynamic its like your in the scenario yourself. All and all a fantastic job keep up the good work. 10/10


                
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Peep Show is driven largely by hearing the inner thoughts of the two main characters. "Up-tight arsehole" we hear Jeremy (Robert Webb) think of Mark (David Mitchell) in the first series. "Work shy freeloader" we hear him think back. This basically sums the pair up, but to delve in a bit deeper Mark gets up and goes to work at a loan lending company every day, where he works up a success-failure set up with co worker Sophie (Olivia Colman) who he fancies, while Jeremy fails to hold down any sort of job and keeps latching onto unrealistic ideas to make it big in life, usually with the help of his retro-hippie mate Super Hans. They are two social misfits who find themselves in various different capers each episode, their inner thoughts ribbling with embarrassment, desire and inner rage.I'm surprised to see this cult British series has now been running since 2003! That's as long as Little Britain and I was expecting it to have been a bit more recent. But there you go. This is just as good, if not a bit better than that show. The humour relies more on subtlety and dry wit, rather than silliness and straight out vulgarity, although it's never afraid to push boundaries. The stars are kind of more likable too. Mitchell and Webb are back to their setup with The Mitchell and Webb Show (which this actually came before...way before!) Mitchell is a reserved, stammering man who occasionally loses it while Webb lays it on thicker than raspberry jam, as the boundlessly wild, enthusiastic Jeremy, who wears his heart on his sleeve a lot more. I wouldn't say it's better than that show, or any worse, they are both great shows in their own right, and the two performers give it that unique air that only they can give it just as much so here. I get the feeling they're playing themselves really and trying to make their hang ups into the stuff of amusement.And yet despite them playing social rejects, they're strangely relatable, as the embarrassing situations they find themselves in and the paranoid, rationalizing thoughts they have just weirdly feel like things that could be happening to you if you were in the situations they find themselves in.Highly enjoyable, this'll end up getting more than just a peep out of you. *****


                
Peep Show is one the best comedy shows to come of Britain for a long time. The golden age of comedy from our isle have been long gone and the BBC having being looking for cheap programmes and sketch show which are poor quality and the other channels haven't been much better. Peep Show is different, it is an original idea which is well written and brilliant preformed by David Mitchell and Robert Webb, two individuals that are naturally quick witted and very funny. Peep Show focuses on the lives of Mark and Jeremy. Mark is a social outcast and a loner, he is awful in social situations and longs to find a relationship. Jeremy is a unemployed loser, who enjoys sex, music and drugs (in that order), who believes he is a talented musician and thinks he is God's gift to women. Throughout the show you see the world through their eyes and hear their inter most thoughts. You also see how their relationships with other characters develop. These include Sophie, the woman Mark longs for, Nancy and Big Suze, the women that Jeremy is most interested, Super Hans, Jeremy's bang mate, Johnson, Mark's boss and Jeff, a horrible bully boy from Mark's workplace.The program is intelligently written and has many cultural references. It has quick witted humour and dark humour. The characters also develop and you end up caring for them, I do feel sorry for Mark at times. As well as the two leading actors it also has a good support cast. It is never over done and tries to be as real as possible. It is a good show and I hope the Americans don't remake the show. This is a program designed for a British audience.


                
I love this show, as the person said above, why isn't it more popular?! its fantastic! well written fantastic acting and camera work! all i can say is hurry up with the next series!! :0)people are seriously missing out if they do not watch this programme, my favourite has to be the university episode, which i have seen many times, in fact i can watch this over and over again and not get bored at all!i even now fancy both of the actors and if either of them want to give me a call thats fine with me!!can anyone tell me when the next series will be out?! i don't think i can go on any longer not knowing!!


                
The brilliance of this show can only be truly measured and appreciated by someone who's shared in the best friend/roommate experience. Friendships, especially those of the codependent variety, are ripe with laughter, anger, ambivalence, envy, thankfulness, and a multitude of other incalculable descriptors. The distinguishing factor that makes this show work so well is the perspective. Viewers are entreated with multidimensional orientations via the internal, personal dialogues of the main characters. From these positions, spectators can fully appreciate the hilarious dynamics of a dysfunctional friendship.Mark Corrigan (David Mitchell) and Jeremy Usborne (Robert Webb) met while they were roommates at the fictitious Dartmouth University. It is at that moment that "The El Dude Brothers" were born.Mark is a slightly below average-looking man with an above average IQ. He values structure, conformity, and regularity. He has a normal job and a degree in Business Studies, but his true passion can be found in History. His appreciation for historical facts and occurrences only helps to solidify his status as the resident dork. Aside from his love of History, Mark has romanticized the ideal of meeting and marrying the perfect woman. Here, we can see a readied dichotomy when compared to his longtime friend and roommate, Jeremy.Jeremy is an above average-looking guy with a not so stellar IQ. He is the epitome of a consummate playboy. Blissfully meandering from one beautiful woman to the next, one can only wonder how Jeremy does it without cerebration or money. Generally jobless, Jeremy is disorganized, morally resistant, and sporadic; he is the antithesis of all things Mark. More often than not, Jeremy seems to come out on top of things without ever trying. Mark, on the other hand, works hard, does the right thing and commonly ends up flat on his face. Not always, though. Sometimes Mark is rewarded for his sacrifices and diligence. Herein lies the comedy. When one friend begins to succeed (work, relationships, etc.), the other is there, by all outwardly appearances, to show their support. At the same time, their internal thoughts are often flush with feelings of jealousy and thoughts of sabotage.Mark and Jeremy are best friends and love each other dearly. Their symbiotic, perhaps slightly unhealthy, relationship is hilarious to watch on the big screen. Perhaps it is because most of us can relate.


                
This is my favourite TV show of all time, narrowly defeating Scrubs although the two are nothing alike. The contrast between the two characters is nothing amazing. The combination of a laid back, lazy yet instantly likable character living with a control freak is as old as sitcoms themselves. However, the clever part of this show is that the inner feelings of the characters can be heard during the episodes. Most of the comedy occurs in this other realm, and the honesty is equally as hilarious as it is insightful. You need a bit of a tough skin to enjoy this show if I'm honest, some of the situations are very real. Not for you if you think 90210 is compelling television. Mark and Jeremy have a strange and awkward dynamic, they get along but both seem to dislike each other. They have a deep- rooted friendship and won't leave each other, although they know they'd be better off. Despite this, they have plenty of good times and you feel as if each character becomes more like the other as time progresses. To sum up, Peep Show is absolutely brilliant, not very Hollywood or glamorous but the best TV never is. Watch it.


                
Why have I only just discovered this comedy... I found all 9 series on Netflix a couple of weeks ago and I can't get enough, I watch whenever I get a free 30 minutes, I'm addicted and don't know how I lived with the show before.It's hilarious, every character is brilliant not just Mark and Jeremy , Big Suze, Super Hans, Johnson are all crazy characters. I'm now on series 4 and it's still not getting old in fact each episode seems better than the last because the characters grow on you and start predicting what's going to happen (not in bad why).Enough of this, I'm off to watch some more Peep Show..


                
One of the few series I could watch more than one time and still be amused by it, and still laughing at its numerous jokes like it's the first time. Other series with this characteristic I can only think of 'Friends' and "The Inbetweeners". Many of everyone everyday problems and facts of life are listed on this show: love, hate, job, envy, jealousy, family etc, and never in a boring way. My wife says it is boys humour but to me there is no gender in a funny joke. Said all this I did not enjoy Jeremy's gay story, I am not sure what the message was. Characters are all interesting, for one reason or another. Jeff, Mark's arch enemy, great with his constant derisory grin is my favourite. Superhans also very funny.
If I had to describe this sitcom in one word, it would simply be 'Wow'! It was airing its 3rd series on Channel4 and I had not previously heard anything about it. I was chatting to someone, so not really paying much attention to it, because the channel it appears on had only been left on after watching the programme scheduled immediately before it. In between my conversation, I merely caught bits and pieces of it, but found my attention kept being drawn to it more and more due to the twisted humour and strange perspective. So I had actually come across the show by chance. I really had never seen anything like it before, so I decided to look it up and read what the critics had said about it. It had received very good reviews, and so I purchased the first 3 series to give it a good go. I am sooooooooo glad I did. There are very few series out there (of which I had heard good things and so purchased on DVD after missing the airings on TV), of which I have felt absolutely 'compelled' to watch the next episode immediately... even if it meant I was awake until 3am or 4am, and yet knew I had to be up early the next day! Occasional series have kept my attention so well, that I happened to 'chainwatch' episodes in one sitting until the whole series had finished, and I physically had no DVDs left to put in the machine! The ones that spring to mind so far are: Dexter, Journeyman (although, guttingly, they only ever made the one series), Prison Break, Friends, King Of Queens, and without doubt, Peep Show. So if you have never really given this show a proper look, then please do so. You may lose a few nights, all-in-one-go, to this show, and may have a few 'zombie' days at work... but you will be immensely rewarded with unique entertainment like you have never seen before. It really is that good. I gave it 10 stars, but if it was possible, I would have given it 11. I don't want to tell you too much about the content of the show, because I want you to experience the show like I did, having not heard anything about it apart from knowing it has received excellent reviews. This is how you will enjoy it even more, because it will just surprise you in the nicest way possible. So get ordering the DVDs now, and enjoy the 'El-Dude brothers' to the max!!! And if ,by chance, any of the production team happens to be reading this review... please, please, please, carry on making this show for as long as you can milk it. It would leave a massive eye-shaped hole in my entertainment schedule if it ever ceased!


                
As an expat brit, I somehow missed peep show even though it has been running for almost a decade. Then it appeared on Netflix, and it is now the top rated TV comedy. Who says the yanks don't have a sense of humour?Anyway, we've watched all seasons over back to back nights ending with the great Christmas lunch and new years party wrap up.I miss all the characters, instantly. It is a trip to go back to episode 1 season 1 and see how young they looked then, way back in 2003 or whenever. Mark actually developed something of a spine over the seasons, and Jes managed to spend a number of episodes actually working. sort of. wow.Anyway if you liked The Office, or CYE, or found bits of big bang theory amusing, or Seinfeld, or Extras, or anything even a little bit dark then Peep Show is the place to be.


                
This is utterly brilliant. From the first few seconds of the very first episode to the final seconds of the last one, (so far), in series 8 the standard never drops. It is easy to overlook the 'supporting characters' because the two central ones are so completely defined, written and portrayed by Mitchell and Webb, but the entire ensemble of characters, whether they feature once or recur more regularly are equally fantastic. The internal dialogue and POV filming make this show so fresh and interesting and the content of what the characters are 'thinking' is so spot on. Really good comedy is about having characters with real character and not just funny lines to say and having enough elements in it that the viewer can relate to. This hits the mark, with 100% accuracy, in those respects. This is better than The Office and with far more episodes too. Is this the best comedy ever? Quite probably!


                
I've watched Peep show 4-5 times now. It's got great comedy with relatable characters and original plots in each episode. Made some people watch this show and it got very mixed reactions! Mostly good though.


                
Watched the box set about 10 times over! Hilarious, awkward, cringey British comedy.


                
I've never been so hooked by a TV show. It's a very honest and daring comedy that is as timeless as it is clever! It aims to shock, yet does so in a hilarious way that leaves you craving more. Some scenes are so jam-packed with awkward situations that you'll actually find yourself cringing as the duo try to cope with everyday life! I highly recommend this to all.


                
I have never written a review of anything before, and god knows the other reviews i have read are far more conclusive and informative. But peepshow is so good and MORE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT to the point that i felt compelled to create an account and give it 10/10 and write a review. I was reading some of the reviews and someone summed it up perfectly, and I paraphrase- a cult classic that has the bonus of leaving those of us who do watch it a little smug. This could not be more accurate, peepshow is one of those programs you keep under your hat, but when it becomes apparent that someone else u know has seen it too you will be trading quotes and laughing about for ages, excluding everyone else from the conversation like a huge inside joke. Far far from a boring sitcom with episodic mundane episodes, peepshow takes the mundane and makes it absurd, awkward and hilarious all whist remaining somewhat believable. This is helped by the fact that Jezz and mark are incredibly easy to relate to, with most people i know who like the show believing that they are themselves, a sort of amalgamation of the two. The real surprise with peepshow however is the dialog especially the internal dialog. Whilst the awkward humour comparable in a way to the office, is what brings people to the show initially, the fantastically witty script is what elevates peep show to new heights. Its down to earth humour usually relating to social anxiety is just so funny, with almost every line being quotable, jezz-"just tell her you love her" mark-"I dunno being the first to say i love you, is a bit like shooting first in a duel... if you miss your f**cked". In short peepshow is bloody fantastic, if you watch two episodes and its not your thing fair enough... however if you skip past it without trying you are only doing yourself a huge disservice.


                
Absolutely love this show. One of my favourite comedy series of all time. Spineless, weak, cowardly, depraved, insecure, self loathing, vindictive comedy at its best. Highly recommend. Series 10 please.


                
My number 1 series of all time.If you like to laugh or need cheering up..... Just shaded Curb your enthusiasm...


                
Excelente comedia , no puedes dejar de verla y te faja con ganas de más .
