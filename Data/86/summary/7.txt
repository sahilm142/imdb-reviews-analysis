 The grand-daddy of all biopics

 did you know him well..

 Can't Sleep at Night? Try Lawrence of Arabia

 very good, not great

 Visually magnificent

 Good Hollywood Treatment of a Historical Subject

 A Dissenting View On Lawrence Of Arabia

 Not what I expected

 A wonderfull background movie

 Lawrence changes personality a little too radically

 Excellent but boring!

 Visually Stunning, Yet Without Enough Structure

 A feast for the eyes

 Epic is the only word that comes to mind

 "Florence of Arabia"

 Visual beauty makes sanctimonious handing tolerable .....

 "The man who gives victory in battle is prized over every other man."

 Long Movie

 Peter O'Toole should have won an Oscar

 An odd, stylishly quirky confection, Increasingly anachronistic.

 Wonderful cinematography and a worthy epic to boot

 Beautiful Direction
