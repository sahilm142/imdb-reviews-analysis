 Good looking sci-fi action series

 I wish I had seen this earlier

 This action-packed and hyper-styled anime is a very human drama in a futuristic setting about crime-fighting adventurers.

 A great equal to Lupin the 3rd.

 great characters

 Greatest Anime of all Time?

 Such a good show with such a bad ending
