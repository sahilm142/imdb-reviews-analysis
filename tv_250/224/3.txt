I agree with other reviews, that the population politics in this series should be discredited. What a wasted opportunity, or perhaps intentional, to wage a real conversation instead of the simplistic eugenics tale. Unfortunately this series mirrors popular misconceptions, and continues the propaganda. It looks great, the characters are interesting, it can be mesmerizing. It is also nauseatingly violent. I confess to watching in entirety, and feeling sick and disgusted. But I couldn't look away. Reminded me of many other movies and shows, Pulp Fiction, Hannibal, Terminator. And Clockwork Orange, but where it was ultimately anti violence, this show celebrates it, tenderizes us so we become accustomed to it. Mesmerizing crap. Just my opinion.


                
I want to give British movies a chance but they are simply bad and boring. The colours are bad, like a stupid dream Nonsens story Unwatchable for me, can't see more than 2 episodesI want to give British movies a chance but they are simply bad and boring.
