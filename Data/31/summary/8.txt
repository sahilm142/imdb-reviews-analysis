 What a gem....

 Crying still

 The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best.

 A Picture To Remember

 Your soul will be touched. I strongly recommend this movie!

 Wonderful portrayal

 You Get What You Deserve

 It's no Shawshank Redemption but it's still worth the watch

 Thought it would be better

 Nice drama, same atmosphere as The Shawshank Redemption

 STRIKE TWO!

 Emotional amd gruesome

 An unexpectedly strange, yet powerful drama.

 Darabond proves his mettle with Green Mile

 A tearjerker with towering performances

 Hard but beautiful

 Frank Darabond proves why he is a master.

 Just stunning on every level.

 Darabond's magic strikes again

 A great film trapped inside a layer of nothing.

 It's one of the better adaptations of a King novel.

 Great story and performances

 When the Clock Strikes Ten.

 Intense, Mysterious, & Gruesome

 Excellent Story, Well Told
