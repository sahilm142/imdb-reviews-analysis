 Didn't engage me.

 The basic falsehood within "12 Years a Slave"

 Story of widespread violence and sadism, not historical facts

 It's the Passion of the Christ for black people

 Forced, pretentious and predictable

 not really that good

 130 + minutes a slave...

 Too Long at 134 Minutes

 Is it worth your money?

 Evoked no emotion

 Mediocre

 Massive Yawnfest

 Disappointed

 Dramatically uninvolving

 Boring

 Worthy but MASSIVELY overrated

 Terrible disappointment
