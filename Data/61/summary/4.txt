 Kubrick's vision falls short once again

 Not as "Shocking" as it tries to be

 More tragedy than thriller

 How to confuse a shallow mind.

 Oh...MY....God! It just keeps getting worse.

 Terror Is Not An Option In This Bloated "Masterpiece" Of Horror

 Predictable, even boring. At best an overly dramatized faux documentary on domestic violence.

 Okay, Stanley Kubrick is a better director than most, but........

 Extremely boring and not scary at all.

 Don't understand how this movie got such high ratings

 Good film! But<U+0085>is it really worth the status of `Horror Classic'??

 Very Very Overrated Film!

 A Less-Than-Lustrous "Shining" That Could've Used A Buff'n'Polish Job

 this has to be one of the most overrated flicks ever.

 Great acting, good drama, NOT scary. See ya later Johnny

 I also take the authors opinion to heart

 Masterpiece? Not quite. . .

 Maybe We're All Really Snowplows

 Not a horror movie...one of the worst movies I have ever seen!

 As a stumped writer...

 unrealistic.. only for people who over-love horror

 What a waste...very sub-par and well below expectations

 Grossly Overrated, But Not Without Interest

 OK Movie, Horrible Adaptation.

 A touching story of one man's love for a steady-cam
