 Not just for fight fans...

 Emotions on par with The Fighter, one of the top combat sport movies since Rocky, one of the best of 2011

 Best Fighting Movie Since Rocky

 Best Sports Movie this year. One of the greatest fighting movie of all time

 It has it's flaws, but not when it comes to entertainment. I was enthralled throughout the movie..

 Don't Watch The Trailer - And Don't Read the Plot on IMDb

 Awesome flick

 Such a powerful movie

 Old Genre / New Life

 Surprised to discover one of my Favorite movies this year!

 Incredibly moving story! Great screenplay.

 Adding to the List of "Great Fighting Movies" is...

 Intense and inspirational - a real winner of a sports drama

 A Must Watch.

 Emotional, long, but very good sports drama

 Well acted, well worth seeing.

 It's not just MMA that makes this different.

 Fight movie that has heart

 Bond of Brothers!

 It earned it's 8.3 - Nice Movie - If you remember Rocky, you'll appreciate this movie

 Outstanding

 Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are the revelations of this superbly riveting exploration of family dynamics and mixed martial arts

 Warrior: better than The Fighter in my opinion...

 This movie deserves more recognition

 Biggest surprise in a very long time
