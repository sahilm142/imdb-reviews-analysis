 The Dark Knight ---- Best Batman Movie Ever.

 Batman just got really modern

 I'm sorry everyone, this is no masterpiece.

 Very Good, But Yikes, Let's Keep Things in Perspective

 Bringing this conversation back down to earth

 Noisy action ,thrills, chills and dazzling production design

 Good? Yes. Great? Yea. Amazingly perfect in every possible way on an epic scale of perfection? No.

 A Knight is Rising

 No Backstory, good action and acting

 One of the best films ever created. Hats down for the whole crew.

 Good, but no where near GREAT

 Good Movie.

 Fantastic Heath Ledger performance... MEDIOCRE FILM!

 Better than Begins

 Eh, it was good, but very overrated

 It was the best of movies; it was the worst of movies

 Shouldn't Be In The Top Fifty

 Legendary

 Good movie, even if you aren't a fan of Batman

 The Dark Night...good, not great

 Batman v/s The Joker

 Let's be honest - They should just call this movie "The Joker"

 Why so serious, right?

 An excellent followup to Batman Begins

 Excellent Sequel to Batman Begins
