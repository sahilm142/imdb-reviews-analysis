 Reflections on a second viewing

 The Coen Brothers come up with another winner.

 Excellent Film

 A freezing fable of stupidity

 fools in the snow

 All in the motives

 My favorite Coen Brother film

 Brutal, tense and hilarious!

 "You're darned tootin'! "

 "You're darn tootin'!"

 Cinema's most assured masterpiece in the lapse of fifty years ( and I'm not kidding)

 Wry, off-beat and undeniably brilliant

 Great flick with a too abrupt ending

 Frances McDormand shines!

 Fantastic crime movie

 Highly Recommended

 Coen brothers' black comedy masterpiece

 Fantastic

 The Compleat Coen

 The Coen Brother's masterpiece......Darn Tootin!

 Genuis of the Cohen's.

 Tantalizing film, superb cast; the violence will be a bit much for some viewers

 This is a true story. Bizarre yet hilarious. Funny yet dramatic.

 An amazing achievement by the Coen brothers

 The Coens most iconic classic.
