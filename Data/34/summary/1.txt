 American History X: A List of Grievances

 Weak, shambles, facile moralising.

 A series of cliches

 Just Horrible

 Preaching me to sleep

 Absolute dreck

 Good but not destined to be a classic

 Worn out pseudo issue of racism, overdone again

 The Klansmen

 full of clichés

 One of the worst films in recent memory

 Cultural Agitprop X

 Very contrived, badly-acted and unrealistic soapbox movie to let us know "Racism is bad!"

 Annoyingly superficial...

 Overrated tripe

 Irksome and Predictable Socialist Rant

 A fascinating look into the minds of Hollywood liberals,

 Terrifying film about American Neo-Nazis, full of violence, followed by redemption, but nauseating

 This movie is blatantly racist.

 over-simple and bad movie

 Worst film of the year.

 One of the worst films ever.

 Contrived & Predictable

 Obvious
