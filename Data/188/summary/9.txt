 A unique visionary film

 Mesmerizing, intelligent and haunting <U+0085>yet overlong and inconsistent

 Stalker is more than a film; it is an act of Faith.

 A way of finding hope in this world ...

 Visions of Faust in a post Chernobyl-like hell.

 Not a typical science fiction movie

 Ideas about the meaning

 Why should you see it

 Not Just For Entertainment

 Deep movie to think over

 the science of fiction and the fiction of science make friction

 Looking for meaning

 Stalker is compelling for not relying on a single gimmick or special effect to create its atmosphere of another world bordering our own.

 Visually Enticing And Abnormally Rare

 True filmmaking art.

 Bizarre Russian Science Fiction

 Seeps into your marrow.

 sci-fi if you want, but not only.

 I fell in love with Stalker

 Do not watch this movie if you dislike foreign films or have misconceptions....
