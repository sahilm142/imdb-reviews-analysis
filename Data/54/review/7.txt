Grave of the Fireflies is a movie that I've desperately wanted to see for a long time. Fortunately, I didn't know about too much of the plot going into it, but I'm afraid that possibly the hype leading up to it might have spoiled the movie for me. Either way, I won't dive too much into the plot of the movie, but I will reference plot points as needed to explain my point of view on the movie. The movie introduces us to the fact that our protagonists are dead and are moving onto the spirit world; however, they look back at what lead them to their deaths. To me, this might have been a mistake, because (for me) I could tell what the plot was going to be from that point on: Brother and sister trying to survive, things get rough, parents probably die, the morals of the older brother probably degrade at some point leading to scenes of him slowly becoming a thief, and in the end they will both die. Unfortunately, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS.For me, that seriously weakens the film. Introducing the audience to the fact that they both die means that movie has already thrown its most powerful punch. When watching the film, nothing felt surprising because I knew how it was going to end. It was simply waiting to see how the sister would die, and then what leads up to the death of the brother. This kills the tension of whether they are going to make it out okay or not... because you know they won't.Now, considering the characters, I also liked a lot of elements, but had some gripes. The protagonist of the film is Seita, a 14 year old boy with his 4 year old sister Setsuko. As life gets worse during the end of WWII, Seita must find ways to make sure that Seita is alive and healthy... or at least that is what he thinks he is doing. This concept is probably my favorite idea of the film, the fact that we have a very loving brother who wants to help his sister be calm and happy, yet he is completely oblivious to the fact that he is actually dooming her. In one scene, his Aunt complains that Seita should help out with the war efforts if he wants more food. What does Seita do? Plays the piano to make his sister happy. Or in another scene where the same Aunt is frustrated at the fact that Seita does no work and suggests that he should leave if he is going to be so lazy. What does Seita do? He leaves with his sister.To me, this is really fascinating because it shows a character who has such an insane amount of pride that he believes he is completely in control and that he can do what he wants and will still turn out okay. Even when it is blatantly obvious that the path he is taking is doomed, he still chooses to not work to get food or to go back to his relatives for help. In the end, this leads to the death of him and his sister.However, I do think that Setsuko is a bit of an issue. I understand that the character is a little kid, but I found her fairly bland as a character. Granted, this is more realistic, but I felt that she was mostly used for nostalgic purposes rather than as an actual character. The only time where I was actually interested in her character was when she was on her deathbed, because she starts to become compassionate and very concerned for Seita, in contrast to the rest of the movie where she is only complaining about her own issues.On an ending, I think a part of the reason I can't quite get into this movie is because the themes of the movie are probably much more confident to Japanese culture and the conflicts during the end of WWII. I know that the Japanese public were mad at their government for not giving up sooner (which lead to massive tragedies) so I have a feeling that Seita's pride may be a representation of those who continued to push the war forward even though it was clearly a bad choice. So while watching the movie I realized that a good portion of the movie's greatness might be tied to its cultural relevance. While I know a lot of people in the West really like this film and say "It is sad movie about how war ruins lives", and I feel like that is missing a lot of what the movie was trying to say. While the war is happening in the movie, very little of it is actually discussed. I would say that the most important theme that I got out of it was "Don't let your pride lead to your destruction." All in all, beautiful film at times, but I just couldn't quite get into it due to its intentional predictability.
(SOME MAJOR SPOILERS) Animation is often a favourable genre as far as I'm concerned regardless of the maturity of the content. 'Grave of the Fireflies' tackles a tough issue, and is pretty much an animated film for adults or older children. As the content deals with the children who are left behind during any-given war, and how they become adjusted to a new way of living.Naturally, being an anime film, it takes the Japanese perspective of World War II, and how the American fire bombings affected the civilians, particularly from the viewpoint of teenage boy, Seita, and his extremely young sister in Setsuko. In the opening scene of the film, it displays the tragic outcome of the lead character, so we immediately know that this isn't going to be a very happy film! The journey of Seita and Setsuko is an interesting one, but also, a frustrating one to watch.I found myself a little annoyed at some of Seita's actions, although it can be related to youthful rebellion and ideals of being able to survive in the wilderness on your own. The conflict between the Aunt towards Seita and Setsuko seemed extremely harsh, and there could have been more depth to the Aunt's intense dislike of her relatives, cause I think it was needed. Although, I did like the play on the Aunt's use of provisions, and her sense of worthiness when allocating them to her immediate family- even though Seita had provided those provisions. It was a subtle way of showing something deeper to the relationship. The Aunt seemed to think they were ungrateful, yet she was equally ungrateful for what they had sacrificed! The scene where the Aunt asks Seita about school is priceless in displaying the undertones of her manner towards him, revealing the nature of her contempt for him- but I still wish there was more exploration as to why she disliked a young boy and his four-year old sister so much. It seemed a little harsh that any person would treat children like that after a horrendous aftermath to their living situation, and especially during wartime survival, and that's why I think there should have been more exploration of that family unit's history. There was a subtle hint at the Uncle's cowardice, but again, his character was hardly in it to be given depth.The other problem I had was Setsuko. She was far too young to be realistically left in the care of her brother, and she seemed to be able to comprehend far too much for someone so young, and as a character, I found her slightly annoying. There was some touching moments between her and Seita though, especially when she follows him to the police station, as well as when he's trying to shield her from the horrors of war. 'Grave of the Fireflies' really gets over the desperation of trying to cope with hunger, shelter in the aftermath of war- but it just lost me with the lack of humanity of Seita's closest relatives, and with the irresponsibility of his later actions. Even during the first bombing, I seriously doubt any mother would leave her youngest daughter out of her own sight. So, while some people may say this film is the essential war film, or more precisely, "anti-war" film- I personally think that is tad overstating its importance. A good animated film that is anti-war- and shows the aftermath of it in a realistic manner-- then perhaps that is fair! However, it's not the essential anti-war/war film, and if you can cope with the characters, then this film is pretty rewarding and somewhat haunting! It is, however, a tad overrated in my book! A reasonably good animated film for adults showing the repercussions and the aftermath of war! ***½ out of *****!


                
This is one of those movies which I only heard of (and got to see) after looking at IMDb's recommendations. That is something I always do: to see the recommendations on the IMDb page of the films that I like. Then I do research on them and decide if they interest me or not.This anime Japanese film is probably better than the average anime stuff that plagues TV nowadays. At least the anime here is less crude and the story is sentimental. Nevertheless, this movie is harsh, with a lot of heavy stuff for an animated motion picture: starvation, war, dropped firebombs, burned corpses/human remains (which is very gruesome), badly injured people, two kids who lose their mother, dead fireflies, the little girl who suffers from malnutrition (it's horrible to see her physical condition like that) and is cremated by her older brother after dying...Basically, this movie tells the tale of two poor children (the older brother Seita and his younger sister Setsuko) and their struggle for survival during the World War II in Japan. The film's language is Japanese either.Like animation historian Ernest Rister says, this is one of - if not the most - profoundly human animated film of all time.
This is a nice film. Interesting, good characters, at times beautiful. Sad, then, that's there's absolutely no reason to watch it.Don't know that war is bad? That it affects innocent children? That some people are horrible? Want to spend some time crying, and spend the rest of the evening depressed and/or haunted? Then this is the film for you.For the rest of us, applaud the film and the obvious effort that's been put into it, and stay away.I'm glad this work exists, as a document of a historical time. And occasionally I'll look back and remember some of its beauty. But I almost wish I hadn't seen it -- my life needs energy and beauty rather than depression -- and it's the only Miyazaki film I wouldn't recommend.


                
I honestly don't know how I feel about this movie. It wasn't at all like I expected; very, quiet, subdued. A lot seemed unoriginal, flat, just played out for dramatic effect. I didn't like the unrealistic animation; at times it seemed to be out of sync with real movement.But then there are moments that completely contradict everything I've just said. The quiet combined with the very unchanging surroundings at times produced some amazingly subtle and beautiful imagery like at the beach scene or the strafing fighter. The first bombing is so much more effectively surprising and horrific because of the empty, quiet streets; when Seita is confused by the napalm sticks, so are we.Perhaps the most confusing thing about this film is the emotions it raises. I did not cry and yet after finishing it I felt empty and cold. I felt like this film is like watching a slow death and it's horrible. It ends on a whimper and a whisper and it is truly tragic, despite what I said above :)


                
The story opens up strongly having the ending shown first, and letting the main character to tell the rest of the story. All around we see people trying to be strong, to be tough in the middle of the harsh environment of war torn civilians. We also see every scope of human nature manifested in this kind of environment, in which people tend to seek their own survival, whatever the means may be. Those can also include how the aunt cheated on the kids about the food and that the aunt's daughter eventually did nothing to help them. What I like from the movie is that there's no depiction of depressed desperation as to leading to suicide. This convey the message to be strong. I watched the Japanese version with English subtitling; the voice acting is very nice. Setsuko's voice are very much the standard cute Japanese little girl, While Seita's voice can really make the character relate to how brothers defend for their kid brother/sister.


                
This is Isao Takahata's very first movie for Studio Ghibli.It was shown along with My Neighbor Totoro back in 1988.What unique about this anime movie is it's more like seeing a live action film than an animated film.It shows how much the Japanese suffered during the WW2 period.Those who think anime is just for kids will be proved wrong with this one. It's just as good as an Accademy Award movie.This movie is tempting in a way. Reason why is that it has allot of deaths, sad moments, and bombings in Kobe.Please know this is not something for little kids to see. I recommend 13 and older. Idon't see a little kid watching this movie. It has allot of people that die from the bombings and a few moments of blood.I recommend this movie to those who like powerful/serious animation.


                
Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this movie, but as a whole I just did not get the emotional impact that many other describe. Maybe because I am cold hearted robot or maybe because I was watching during an unbearable heat wave, but it just did not hit me that hard. There is no real criticism for the movie, but I am not going to go out and tell everyone about the movie. A large part of the emotional impact comes from being familiar with the culture and the whole idea of having to rebuild a life after it being destroyed, but it did not hit me. I would say Seita was an aggravating character and it seems as if there must have been plenty more options than just living in the caves. Other than that a few of my few favorite points is that they do not hide the fact that this was going to be a sad movie right from the beginning and the fact that it began the way it did made it tragic. It was very slow, but the slowness added to the slow decay of the children. One of my favorite parts was the most devastating thing for Seita was when he finds out that Japan "the greatest empire in the world" was defeated and surrendered unconditionally that he finally breaks down. Even when his sister dies he does not show the emotion which shows the Japanesse issue in having to rebuild what was once thought a superior society to conform to something that they must have hated. The fire bombings of Japan is one of the most tragic events of our world's history. The horror of it was lessened a bit, but it was still potent. A very well done movie, but because everyone had told me that this was a great movie it disappointed me a little bit (but it might also be because I am a robot).
Grave of the Fireflies is based on a true story. The central characters are an orphaned brother and much younger sister in WW2 Japan. The city of Kobe has recently come under Allied fire bombing and most of the wooden houses have burned down including that of Seita and Setsuko. The children first live with a family friend who quickly becomes very nasty. They then move to a bomb shelter and try to survive the war.I like the fact that this film is anti-war and it does tell a touching story. But, I don't consider it, on first viewing, to be quite the classic it's made out to be. To be honest, I couldn't get into the whole anime thing. Even the faces were not realistic. If this had been a real movie with real actors, it would have been tougher to make, but the impact (for me) would have been far greater. Some of the plot points didn't make sense either. If Seita could access all that money in his mothers account, why did Setsuko have to reach a point of starvation for him to get his hands on it.Please don't let my views on this film discourage you from watching it. Overall, it is a good film and very well perceived by critics and IMDb voters.


                
Grave of the Fireflies is, probably one of the most touching animes I have ever seen. The story takes place in Japan during the end of the WW2 and we get to meet a brother and his sister, trying to survive during the hard times and misery Japan faced at the bitter end of the war. The anime, who is from 1988, feels like it's delivering an old vibe of the anime style, and with a smooth roll the story develops and tightens up into something you never would've imagined before you pressed "Play". Too bad though that I had such big expectations on this piece. I've heard it's "so sad" and that you're about to cry for a lifetime, but hey it's a piece that won't get you to smile but it won't ruin your mood forever either! A 7 out of 10 - and it would've gotten higher points unless it didn't felt so short and empty of action from time to time.


                
Yes you'll suffer you'll cry. How can you not. But really, honestly, was it needed? was there anything you didn't know? that people die in wartime? that children lose their parents and will likely get the most horrible of fates? There is no hope whatsoever in this movie, but that's not the point, there is also not much you can take away, if not that "love alone wont suffice", had anyone had doubts on that. If you have a 4-5 yo or have had it recently, you might find yourself wrenching in pain, as i did tonight. .. and you might have wished you had spared yourself that. The rest is a look at Japanese society 50 60 years ago, with good and bads not dissimilar to the rest of the world,
This was one of the most depressing films I have seen... well in a long time and in terms of being uncompromisingly grim, possibly the most depressing ever. Even film's like Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark (2000) had a glimmer of hope that things would be OK.I loved how much an animated feature could make me feel so strongly about something and I understand that the point of this film was how relentless war is, but watching this was just like watching depression-session-misery-torture.There was no way of it ending up with any form of hope, joy or optimism, not that I wanted it to, but I wanted to think that it could. I do not mind something not having a happy-ever-after ending, in fact I'd usually complain when things are too happy-happy but I think that the best tear-jerker moments and the ones that have the most impact are those where either unfortunate events, to a certain extent come by surprise, or more specifically that you know there could be something horrible about to happen but you are still not sure and there is still the chance of everything being alright. The shattering of this built up hope leaves you feeling more vulnerable and therefore increases the effectiveness of the narrative.By showing you at this film's opening that the main character dies and joins his little sister in the afterlife, once his mother dies in the opening act you know there really is no way out for the doomed little boy. This does succeed at showing the uncompromising relentless nature of war but it really was tortuous and difficult to watch. In a way I admire the film's approach but at the same time I didn't really enjoy it.Twitter: @destroyapathy www.destroy-apathy.blogspot.com
One common criticism of this movie is the sentimentality. I did find while watching the movie that the child's constant crying did become annoying after a while. Some people are more easily influenced by sentimentality than others, but the sob elements in Grave of the Fireflies seem too excessive to be realistic. The child behaves too much like a child, almost as if the maker wanted to emphasize that the victim was a child to artificially heighten emotions. Towards the end though the sentimentality becomes more effective.My dad walked out on the movie because it was an anime. Anime and cartoons are often seen as childish and some people are too proud of themselves to watch movies they perceive as childish. Dad returned halfway through the movie but complained that nothing was happening, so he left again. All viewers are different. Hollywood executives are aware that a significant proportion of viewers are averse to a movie in which nothing big happens. This leads to a situation in which action (mainly violent action with explosions) is often interspersed throughout a movie -- maybe a chase scene added in the middle of a boring dialogue session or a sex scence for shock effect.


                
The film is about WW2 and the effect it has on a Japanese family. A young boy and his little sister are separated from their mother during a bombing raid and lose their home in the process. Their father is off in the navy so he can't help them. Throughout the film they lose everything and it's up to the young boy to take care of his sister when their mother died and their aunt didn't want them to stay any longer. This isn't your typical happy ending type of movie. It shows the horrors of war and I think the anime makes it easier to take. I'm not big into anime but this one made me feel for the characters even if I think the movie may have had a bigger effect in live action.
The reviews were great and the movie lived up to its projected image too. However, the effect wore off too soon. Maybe I didn't get as emotionally invested as most people did. The bond between Seita and Setsuko really makes you relish the beauty of love amidst the brutality of the world. All the emotions overwhelmed me from time to time - the sadness, the laughter, the reality, the dreams of a little girl and her brother protecting her with everything he's got. It was all there, just it didn't consume me long enough to leave a mark in my thoughts.


                
Grave of the Fireflies follows a boy and his little sister as they try to live on their own after losing their family to the war. The story itself is interesting and well presented, and there's lot's of twists and turns throughout that only increase this aspect. There's not a whole lot to say about what's good. It's an interesting story and I think it deserves the rating I gave it, but as far as specific things it lacks in those. Maybe this was because I watched it dubbed, but the voice actors really bothered me. Not because they didn't suit the characters, but they just read their lines with little to no expression. The city is being bombed, for crying out loud! Sound a bit more worried voice actors, come on. Some aspects of this movie were a little confusing, specifically the air raid/bombing scenes. There were multiple points in the story where characters would go to a bomb shelter, then come out and live life normally. So, did they get bombed? Did they not? I don't understand. I eventually kind of figured it out, but regardless it was pretty unclear for a non-history junkie like myself.Everyone says that this movie is super sad and all that, but I didn't think that at all. The ending is super predictable, and I kept wondering if maybe there'd be some crazy twist that proved why the movie was so sad, but nope. It ends exactly how you think it will. Sure, the events leading up are unfortunate, but I was never legitimately sad about any aspect of this movie, save for the lack of ability from the voice actors. Overall Grave of the Fireflies is pretty good, but that's it. The voice acting is subpar, some aspects are a little unclear, and the ending is very predictable. Next time I'll definitely watch the subbed version. In the end I'd still recommend it, just go for subbed. It can't be any worse than the dub.


                
I just finished watching this movie on TCM. I've heard such good things about this movie, and I was so excited to see that it was going to be on, but then I was SO disappointed that it was dubbed. Though it's difficult to watch gorgeous Japanese animation AND read subtitles, I feel that too much is lost in translation when the film is dubbed. Two perfect examples of that are "Spirited Away" and "Howl's Moving Castle." I've seen both the Japanese and English versions, and they felt like different movies.Getting back to "Grave of the Fireflies," it was actually a bit of a disappointment. But I blame Miyazaki for that. Once you've become a connoisseur of his work, nothing else compares. It was a very compelling film, beautifully drawn, but it didn't live up to the hype for me.Obviously from the rating I gave it, I still loved it. I really appreciated how such grim subject matter was treated with such reverence (2 things that seem like oxymorons when dealing with animated film; I loved how the suffering and the death was portrayed with such incredible realism (so to speak); and I have to say that I shed quite a few tears during this film, from the first sentence to the last. But one of the things that I found so incredibly compelling was the 2 kids' ability to find laughter and fun even when surrounded by the horrors of war. That aspect of it rang more truly for me than any other part. I'm not sure why.The end was pretty weak when compared with the rest of the film, but then we already know how it ends. I would have done a few things differently to {perhaps} more effectively tear at your heart: *******SPOILERS HERE******* I would have let the watermelon drop off Setsuko's chest when she died; when her spirit was flitting in and out of your vision at the shelter, the one where she was reflected in the water - I would have let her disappear while her reflection remained; and I would have explained how much time passed between Setsuko's death and Seita's, and I would have explained how he ended up where he did. It was a little confusing to know that in the final scenes before we know he died, he had just bought a lot of food, and had withdrawn 3000 yen from the bank.*********SPOILERS DONE******** I think this movie should be required viewing for elementary and middle school children. I used to think that about "Saving Private Ryan," but that movie is too visceral for the kiddies. Using animation in this way, deadly serious subject matter can be effectively conveyed, while the medium softens the blow a bit for the younger viewers. Perhaps there would be an end to war.No matter my complaints I still think this was a marvelous movie. I'm not sure if it's one of the top 250 movies of all time, but it's really good, certainly unique, and well worth watching.Highly recommend. Enjoy.
The only thing I'd heard about this movie before seeing it was many people saying that it was the saddest movie they've ever seen. I finished watching it about a half an hour ago, and I can only conclude that the people who think so probably don't watch many sad movies.It was very good and even sad, but it was far from the saddest movie I've ever seen. Perhaps it's the first five minutes of the movie that "ruined" that element for me. It was made perfectly clear what was going to happen by the end, so expecting it made it less sad. To me, anyway.I guess I'll have to chalk this up to another "est" movie- saddest, scariest, funniest- that many have viseral reactions to that I simply don't get.
