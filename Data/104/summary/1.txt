 To quote Mr. Ritchie "Boring and unwatchable."

 "Snatch." - a disgrace to England

 Over the top, pretentious and generally bad

 If we're retitling films with vulgar names for parts of the human anatomy, this would better be titled...

 Are you serious?

 Wants to be hip too much.

 Boring,not funny

 Wake me up when this movie is over please....

 YUCK

 Brad Pitt and Benico Del Toro...

 The Tarantino Wanna-Be Who Made it Big

 Awful

 too smart for its own sake

 More of the same.

 Do not Rent

 I don't know anything about this movie because I was asleep

 gratuitously violent, especially regarding treatment of dogs
