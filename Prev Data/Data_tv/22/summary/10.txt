 Best of all Anime and better than the earlier version

 Such a Great Amime, it is a must watch series

 Equivalent Exchange - Give time to watch = Pleasure out of it

 No complaints, seriously. FANTASTIC.

 The jack-of-all-trades anime

 probably the greatest animated entertainment ever made

 Most well-done anime ever

 Surpasses the Original in Many Ways

 I feel like my spirit is elevated after having just finished the last episode.

 Simply put, I have not one single complaint.

 One of the masterpieces among TV series

 Not overrated, it is the best anime out there.

 WOOHOOOO I loved it.

 Awesome anime, better than the so called "original".

 You know when a show keeps you on the edge of your seat while you are binging it and then rewatch it again with same passion you know how it was.

 Captivating

 Simply Amazing
