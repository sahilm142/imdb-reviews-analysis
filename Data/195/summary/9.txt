 Prescient...

 A Great Film About 20 Years After & Before It Was Needed

 "I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!" - Howard Beale

 A Cynic's Dream

 "The World Is A Business, Mr. Beale"

 Only surprise is, it wasn't cynical enough

 He did it again.

 Sidney Lumet Sees Into the Future of American Broadcasting

 At least there's radio

 It's What Television Has Become

 Exceptional but certainly NOT a picture you should let your kids see

 This film is so before it's time, it's clairvoyant.

 It's All About the Characters

 Network scores

 The mad prophet of the air

 The Empty Tube

 Admirably Intelligent and Scarily Prophetic ...

 Cert

 A taste of television and how it works.

 A masterpiece worth watching

 " Don't do it kid! You've got your whole life ahead of you! "

 "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"

 "I Just Ran Out of Bull****"

 A relevant film

 Involving, smart and on target
