 Start from the beginning - you wouldn't watch a foreign film without subtitles, would you?

 Impeccable...

 Mad Woman Falling in Love with Mad Men

 Mad Men is The Great Gatsby Part 2

 Finally a show to love

 NOT a Soap Opera: Excellent Modern Drama -- AMC's Best Series

 Great new series!

 '60s advertising men on Madison Avenue - the "Mad Men"

 My current fave

 Must watch Season 4

 Modern 2008 speech patterns used throughout!

 Victim of a backlash?

 A good look at the 1960's culture. Shown in the world of advertising that involves office politics, back room deals, vanity, and adultery.

 A 60's Melodrama-Style TV Series

 Probably the Best Written Drama since THE WEST WING

 Time Capsule of Sixties Style & Human Behavior...

 Too much quality

 Madmen

 They threw it down the well and it made a hell of a splash

 Tactless scripting

 A show with a lot of subtlety

 Really Captures the Late 50's - Early 60's

 Mad Men Is A Winner

 Awesome show!

 couldn't stop watching
