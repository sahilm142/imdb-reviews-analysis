 See it for what it is

 Why?

 Best sleep of my life !

 don't tell me you're sorry..

 The Greatest American Movie Ever Created

 This film may have once been regarded the finest motion picture of all time but 72 years later, its still regarded as a great movie

 Non-chronological history of the ups and downs in the life of Charles Foster Kane, based on the character of Randolph Hearst

 Life through a snow globe

 no match to Casablanca

 Giant of its field

 A Classic Story Of Power And The Press.

 Certainly a classic, but over-hyped for my tastes

 Technically great and it still holds up today, but not like it did.

 Citizen Kane

 Excellent movie. Not my personal style of movie. But very professional. And should be seen at least once.

 Citizen Kane - Not the Greatest Film Ever Made

 I don't get the point...

 melancholic atmosphere movie, thin story, great acting

 A movie, yes, the greatest, no

 Well made but overrated

 Did Orson Welles travel back in time to make a movie about the post-truth era and its greatest champion?

 A master charlatan at work

 Well-studied Plot

 The supreme movie that fails to entertain

 A great story that stands the test of time.
