I must assume that all those other reviewers had just watched the 1st season which was funny in a cheeky, fresh kind of way. But 2nd and 3rd have zero laughs and to compound upon the total lack of comedic value, they present the main characters as spineless and stupid, lying all the time to their spouses like they're adolescent boys hiding from their mothers. It's even more annoying than the constant cringe-fest of american pseudo-comedies. So, if you must, watch season 1 and for the love of god skip the others. It's almost like the first attracted a crowd and the BBC socialist suits saw their chance to turn a good show into yet another PC man-hate indoctrination session. Which would explain why it's not funny.
