 The most relevant French film of the last 20 years

 Great achievement. One of the most unforgettable Euro movies of the 90's.

 this concerns everyone

 how can you sum up a film this beautiful & slick

 "La Haine"; Mathieu Kassovitz' stark social study of violence, fear and hatred, remains the powerful masterpiece it was in '95.

 great movie about social problems and how they're being dealt with

 Blew me away 10/10

 Excellent

 A French Classic of Indie Film

 A film that bristles with style, authenticity and a general bleakness

 "...it's not how you fall that matters. It's how you land."

 French cinema at its most shocking!

 Viha- La Haine

 The world is ours.

 I fell in love with the Jew...

 How can a film made in the 90s still resonate in the 00s? Ask Kassovitz!

 "So far, so good"

 Nice scenario

 Banlieue

 One of the most amazing films ever made

 This movie is way too down in the ratings

 Dedicated to the dead (major spoilers)

 one of the great films of the late 20th century

 best film of its year; pure urban horror filmed in unflinching and poetic eyes

 Surely there can be no hate for La Haine.
