 All comedies should be like this

 This is what I have been waiting for!!

 Possibly the best thing to ever happen to television

 More Please...

 Possibly the best British show ever!!!

 Brilliant and entertaining!

 Exactly what french TV will never be able to do !

 Americans should watch "Spaced"

 Wonderful

 It's life Tim, and boy, do they know it.

 If you were born between 1970 and 1980...

 Sp"ACE"ed

 Thin

 Best British comedy ever!

 A slice of fried gold

 Puts all US sitcoms to shame....

 Constantly clever, funny and imaginative - Friends doesn't even deserve to be on the same channel!

 Sublime

 I am in love with this program!

 Fantastic early work from Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, Nick Frost and co.

 This is my generation...

 Another Bloody Classic

 10 out of 10

 Fantastic!

 Sublime - no other word for it!
