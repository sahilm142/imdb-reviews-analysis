This is an emotional drama that, after the opening scene, was never quite able to hit my heartstrings. The story has two, or arguably three, main characters. Some movies are able to pull this off, but this one never seems to provide quite enough background or personality behind the characters to make me feel emotionally attached to any of them.The acting also played a role in my failure to connect. Many scenes were acted convincingly or adequately, but others seemed either unrealistic or overacted. In my opinion, the only consistent actor played the brother Salim, who was quite funny in several scenes (even if one of those scenes abruptly killed an emotional scene).A final comment is that the composer and director quite obviously did not cooperate for this film. Whenever background music is playing, the end transition never failed to be jarring. The music would stop or change in such a way that never failed to break any immersion I had in the film. It was very apparent that the director, composer, editor, etc. did not have any idea how to make a musical transition.
