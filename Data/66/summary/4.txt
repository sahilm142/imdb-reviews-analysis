 Violence without sense

 The octopus acted first class

 Overrated

 A guy put in jail for no reason for 15 years. He fights his demons as a crave for revenge is building.

 Why do viewers feel compelled to overpraise extreme cinema?

 Lost me with the octopus

 The tyranny of plot over character.

 Not worth all the hype

 Good beginning, weak ending

 Best Asian movie of all times? Yeah if all you've seen was Pokemon the movie.

 South Korea is nicer than this film implies

 Bedazzling, but not in a good way!

 Sick storie

 Intriguing premise...
