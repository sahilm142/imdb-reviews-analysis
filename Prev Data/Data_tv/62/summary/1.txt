 Go seek quality.

 This "show" is like a 30 minute belch

 Watched four episodes (from seasons 1 and 2), not really funny

 No talented actors ... how did they get their show?

 Gave me a headache

 It's seldom sunny, yet rather unfunny in Philadelphia.

 My god people HOW

 Terrible New Season

 nothing less then 1 * to bad

 I gave it a shot

 The only thing remotely good in this show is Danny DeVito!

 wow

 Deepest crap ever !!!

 Unfunny Comedy !

 Garbage

 Not funny and all they do is shout!

 Garbage

 I can't believe how awful this show is

 For the Low of Standard
