I just watched the first episode and peeked into the second, and I am more than annoyed. Have I accidentally rented the wrong DVD? Is this show the one all the IMDb voters have seen? This show was recommended to me because I like Father Ted, Black Boooks, IT Crowd, etc. And what does this piece of "series" turn out to be? Stale, well-behaved, not even slightly absurd relationship garbage (type "roommate comedy"), probably targeted mostly at college folks. What's next? Are people going to tell me it is just like The Young Ones, only better (because its not as depressing and disgusting)?All you out there who like British comedy for the bizarre and psychopathic characters, the pitch dark humor, the really painful slapstick (give me some Fawlty Towers!), the really disgusting bits, stay *far* away from this! This is toothless boredom for the Big Brother/Ally McBeal/Sex and the City generation. Maybe it's a step up if you're used to Roseanne and stuff like that. I wouldn't know.Honestly, why do so many people like this? The editing is pretentious (what do all the shaky camera and the whoosh-whoosh cuts actually do story-wise or wit-wise?), there are no detectable punch-lines, the actors are merely saying the words and making stupid faces instead of acting (oh boy... the "crying" scene in the café in he first episode!), and there is this constant muzak playing in the background. I could go on! I think I am now going to wash my brains out with some The Comic Strip Presents... or League of Gentlemen! And it's now time for you guys to find this comment "not helpful".


                
After watching the first episode I can honestly say this show is below average at best. It's another example of an entertainment starved country clinging to their sad version of a celebrity, no matter how boring he may be. At least they didn't let it run forever like that terrible Black Adder show.
