The ending is heartwarming and there are a few standout scenes here - Charlie's song and dance at the end, his rollerskating through the department store, and the factory machine feeding early on, but otherwise it is short on laughs, and the story feels like some loosely pieced together fragments that don't totally belong together.The 1930's camera seems drunk on its ability to move freely, and as such can't stand still, panning slightly this way and that, and dollying when there is no cause to, and all the while being completely unable to mask the lack of laughs - the complete opposite of Charlie's best work, which could make you laugh despite the most simple of camera set ups.It is also difficult to believe the lead female is in poverty. She is made up, beautiful, dressed nicely enough, and has a face full of laughter and charisma - impossible to believe the circumstances of her life have been too difficult, as the film wishes us too. The apparent confusion on whether it ought to be a silent or sound film adds to the problems, sometimes giving title cards and sometimes spoken word, and to top it all off, even Charlie's performance is not at his usual high standard - tending to overplay things.Thematically it is splitting. On the one hand it may be an argument for creativity and individuality amongst a rigid, soul-sucking, mechanical world - and this is a fine message - but on the other hand it glorifies thieves. All things considered, I would say modernization did not suit Charlie very well.
