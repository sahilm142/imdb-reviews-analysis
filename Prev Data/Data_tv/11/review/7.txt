I'm from the North Jersey area, so a lot of the fun of the Sopranoes is relating it to the things I see and do in my daily life, though despite this, I didn't really have HBO and never really watched the Sopranoes, when it had premiered on television. Except with the 6 season, I saw the whole show on DVD. It was not the first television show I experienced through DVD, and if you've done that before, very well, you could know how incredible it is, and I have to say that while I greatly enjoyed a lot of what the Sopranoes had to offer, in the end, I was disappointed by how the show had been done and what direction it moved to. Judging the show as a whole, what made the show great was practically absent come parts of season 4, and the over-arching brilliance wasn't there anymore with the third season. The Positive Aspects: -The 1st, 2nd, and parts of the 3rd seasons are as great as any domestic/mob drama worthy of the praise its been getting. The characters are sublime and the themes and story lines are great art as well as television at top-notch. -The acting of the main characters is exquisite and enormously realized with AJ, the son, being the only exception. -Even, when it's off, it's still compelling The Negative Aspects: -The show tapers after the 2nd season into weaker story lines and uneven characterization and ceases to make its over-arching thematic points effectively, every season already being progressively worse from the get-go now entering into the territory of non-great television. - The seasons are short, and the cast is huge, making a lot of plot-threads and maybe more than half the cast that deserves better set-up and/or development seem rushed, both under and overplayed, or too easily disposed of, at times egregiously, the tolerability of this coinciding with the show's decline. -The acting of the minor characters is very inconsistent, leaning more of the time in the worse direction, much more than what you could find on certain shows off paycable. The finale, which is greatly talked of, really doesn't matter, because the show thematically shot itself in the foot even before its halfway point. Each season got progressively worse starting with the first one. The second one was still incredible, and if the show ended at the end of the second season it could have gone down as the amazing show it should be. Instead we get a mess of a television program that wants to say something but cluttered itself way to much to. Check the show out because it contains certain aspects so touching and so grand that they shall stay with you, being profoundly artistic and exceedingly relevant to modern society, television at its pinnacle of art/entertainment. But if it starts running out of gas, that's when you should stop watching, because it'll never get it back.


                
I watched this for the first season and about half of the second. And then gave up. I gave it 7/10 because I got that far, but 70 percent was not enough to continue. I have watched other TV series – and the inevitable comparisons must be made. "Breaking Bad" is far and away the very best I have seen – far superior to "The Sopranos".The Good: Tony Soprano's relationship with his wife, children and mother was always interesting. These were the best parts of the series and the most convincing. Overall the women in this series were real and three dimensional.The Bad: All of Tonys' Mafioso friends were caricatures and stereotypes. The script for them was comic book. I got irritated by the boring Godfather imitations and the frequent misogyny. Really, the story-line, script and dialogue were pretty weak. Not much was going on and not much of a plot in all this. There was never an episode where I felt I had to move immediately onto the next. In fact several times the opposite – hit the fast-forward.The Ugly: I became really, really tired of Christopher and his girlfriend, Adriana. The whole sub-plot of them desiring to be music-producers, then wannabe actors, directors was boring and unconvincing. Speaking of "unconvincing" the character of Christopher was just that.Compared to "Breaking Bad" the story-line was plodding, one- dimensional, with no plot twists. Compared to "The Wire" there was little intensity, nothing was gripping. Compared to "Dexter" the characterizations were not enthralling. Compared to "Wentworth" no new characters were introduced to add vitality. And in general, there was not much of an atmosphere of any type to give depth and continuation to this series.
There just weren't many redeeming qualities with the main characters. Otherwise it's a great mob series


                
The sopranos came out guns blazing and ended with a dud. Each season was worse then the previous. The final season,and especially the series finale were as anti climatic as they come. The series finale was the worst episode of the shows run, David Chase basically gave the fans the middle finger. Rumors always swirl about a movie, but quite frankly who cares. If it happens it will only be because James gandolfini needs a paycheck. The only reason I even give it 7 stars is because in the beginning it really was a great show, then they spent a hole season on sal and johnnycakes which was the beginning of the end. When Tony escaped from Johnny saks house and walked all the way back to jersey, I knew I had entered the theatre of the absurd. Paulie roughing up a lawn guy and stealing his lawnmower, gimme a break. The only character that was great from start to finish was sylvio, who was a true mobster until the end. If you haven't watched yet, do yourself a favor and just watch the first 2 or 3 seasons, after that it's just pure disappointment.


                
After reading couple of lists of all times best TV shows and seeing The sopranos there I decided to give it a try.I have to say I was left a little disappointed maybe because I had higher expectations for the show.Haven't I watched shows like The wire,Breaking bad and True detective before I might have given it 9.The show goes a bit slow for my liking and the seasons usually end a bit strange almost like someone suddenly decided they had enough episodes to wrap it up so is time for a break.The good thing about the show going a bit slow is that at least characters are well developed there no random people suddenly popping in and acting is also great.Script is believable and they are not afraid to get rid of key characters ( almost like R.R.Martin wrote it or he might have I haven't checked).Overall a good show but at least to me not a must watch.


                
I would have given the Soprano's a comfortable 9/10 for every episode up until the last one of the series. It is one of the few television dramas which takes a subject that we all love (gangsters and the mafia) and combines it with real life problems that ordinary people face such as mental illness, death and divorce to name but a few. The show is able to get a good mixture of action and dialogue, as well as comedy moments so that it is not an all guns blazing style of programme that we cannot really take seriously.However..... the final episode is atrocious. The ambiguity of the ending is in my opinion ridiculous (and I enjoy ambiguous conclusions when they are done well, The Grey and Basic Instinct stand out the most), seeings as the whole tone of the final season was suggesting that Tony would either be murdered or jailed, like many of his associates. The very final sequence is laughable, with Meadow failing to park the car, the rest of the family in the diner and Journey playing over everything, it gives a childish ending to an otherwise superb TV show. If someone were to ask me whether or not they should watch it, I would say don't waste your time because it doesn't have a proper ending.
Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy, and you have THE SOPRANOS, about a mob clan operating out of northern New Jersey. It's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling. I am not the biggest fan of this show, but I do admire James Gandolfini's very complicated Tony Soprano, a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience. I also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel-voiced Dom Chianese as the bewildered but murderous Uncle Junior, silver-haired Tony Sirico as the perpetually perplexed Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the duplicitous, tough-as-nails Carmela Soprano. The violence is sudden and graphic, the body count steadily climbs each season, but it is often the small moments that matter most here. Watch Paulie and Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli late of LAW & ORDER) as they get lost in the Pine Barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck, both convinced they've had it.


                
One moment they're being funny, then suddenly they're brutally killing someone. But you need the contrast. Thats who these people are. Call it Omerta, the Mafia code of silence. But like Pizza which was originally Italian, the Americans try to copy the Cosa Nostra too because they are proud to have some Italian blood left in them, and they should be, at least while they are still on time. I mean look at Tony's kids, poor guy, the dream is over, they're spoilt American brats now and there is no going round it, no matter how much pasta you push on them, they are gonna insist on bloody Mc Donalds. Is that what he wants for them? To be like "normal" kids? OK, then why does he not start with himself? the big fat lazy fxxk. Grow up and get a real job Tony and provide for your family like a man not a teenage gangster, and enough of those Pacino movies Tony, I had enough, go to your room!!!!. I'm looking forward to the fifth series. Each character in the Soprano's is very well analyised.
