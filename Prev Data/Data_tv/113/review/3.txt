This show used to be really good but now it's un-watchable. Especially after season 7. The shows tag line is space, time, life itself. But now explores titles like 'what makes a terrorist', 'is privacy dead'. I mean, for real? What is this show about in the first place.I was expecting a show with new breakthroughs in science and technology, like the previous season's episodes, but now I'm going to search for another science show. I think the producers have lost their minds and just want in on the news. Don't watch it if you are expecting anything related to science.


                
A huge disappointment for people who're looking for actual latest information & knowledge about Stars, Galaxies, Planets & Universe. I was hoping this would be more about Space & time, NASA's new missions & mysteries of the Cosmos but its all about newbie scientists sharing their weird ideas which they can't even prove. This season has totally drifted away from the word "WORMHOLE" & into information overload which basically causes a loss of interest since as viewer i'm not interested in what Mr. XYZ believes about reality, rather i'm interested in what's going on the far reaches of space & time & whats the latest on Wormholes, Darkmatter, Darkenergy, Blackholes, Supernovae etc. If it wasn't for Mr. Freeman I don't think this show would have gathered any significant audience at all. My review, a confused show.
