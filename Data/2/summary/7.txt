 Very Average Film. Very Overrated

 Re-configured Genre

 Good, Maybe Great, Not The Best Movie Ever

 To Many Unseen Plot Points

 An overrated classic.

 Probably - if not definitely - the most overrated movie of all time

 Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.

 It's all business

 The Godfather: 7/10

 Its good but Geez....

 Overrated

 Brilliant, engrossing study of organized crime family...

 Great moments, but disjointed and slow in parts

 A Wonderful Masterpiece The Godfather

 Vito Corleone ain't gonna win Father of the Year

 One of the most overrated movies on IMDb

 Great Movie...But Not Perfect

 bbb

 Entertaining....but tell me why should I feel for these people.

 Great movie but extremely overrated

 Classic mob hit

 AWESOME

 Overrated! Vastly inferior to the second film... (Very Minor Spoilers)
