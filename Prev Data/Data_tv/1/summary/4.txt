 At once awe-inspiring and terrifying!

 Yet another masterpiece from BBC Nature & David Attenborough

 Astounding

 Mesmerizing

 Dangerously beautiful

 Best thing on TV since last Planet Earth

 Greatest documentary ever created.

 One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen

 Excellent

 Like the first 'Planet Earth', does for nature and our planet as 'Walking with Dinosaurs' did with the dinosaurs

 Incredible

 This documentary gives you goosebumps.

 Peerless evocation of nature across the globe

 What a Beautiful Planet- Bewitching !

 The greatest TV production ever broadcast

 In times of climate deniers, hope

 This masterpiece deserves higher scores

 Spectacular, simply spectacular

 Best thing I have ever watched on TV

 BBC succeeded in perfection with this one, a truly must watch
