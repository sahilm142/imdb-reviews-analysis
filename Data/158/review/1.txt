Talk about boring - Good comedy should at least be plausible This tripe is completely unbelievable and juvenile If your a conservative uneducated fool who likes Abbott and Costello and the Three Stooges your sure to love this! :)The people who relish Keaton, Chaplin and WC Fields are the same conservative nuts who hate such great comedians as Harold Lloyd and Wheeler and Woolsey because of their liberal attitudes and realistic acting.You will find Keaton's best work in the early sound features he made for MGM during the year 1928-1932. (These are also the ones the conservatives will tell you not to watch but Don't LISTEN TO THEM!) Stay away from Keaton's silent pictures unless you enjoy listening to long sermons on Sunday! LOL :)
