 Speaking Eyes

 Deserves the Acclaim It Has Received

 The secret of his eyes

 Splendid film full of emotion , love , intrigue and feeling of joy and sorrow

 Good movie

 Superb narrative

 Truly Remarkable

 A powerful film

 Possibly the best foreign thriller of the year !

 Excellent Argentinian drama/mystery

 Why didn't I see that before?!!

 Very Nicely Executed Adult Murder Mystery.

 A Powerful and Thought-Provoking Masterpiece

 Good, but I think it's a bit overrated.

 Eyes with Passion

 A wonderful, richly layered mystery.

 very good, but demands some patience and concentration from it's audience

 sex, humor, mystery, redemption, murder, and love it just has everything

 Can One Forsake a Passion?

 I didn't want it to end

 Amazing

 A Great Movie

 The beauty of the eyes

 The Girl With The Secret In Her Eyes.

 Too much going on here: a murder mystery with politics, comedy, and romance
