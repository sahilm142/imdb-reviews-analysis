 Let's be honest, it really isn't good!

 Top Gear: Supersized and Supershallow Edition

 So disappointing

 It is not looking good.

 Still Hoping for Better

 Unfortunately "The Grand Tour" is a Grand disappointment

 Dumbed down to the extreme...!

 Disrespect is my second name

 Not the worst, but amazingly bad

 Ouch

 Meh

 The Groan Tour zzzzzzzzzz

 If you're looking for a car show, look elsewhere

 Gone downhill.

 Poor. Lost it's appeal
