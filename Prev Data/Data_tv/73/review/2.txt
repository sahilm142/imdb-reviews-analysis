I am in a distinct minority when it comes to this show. I found Chappelle oddly amusing as the insult comic in THE NUTTY PROFESSOR but not the slightest bit amusing on his own show. The characters, the routines, the gags, all leave me cold. Clearly, the show is aimed at a very specific audience. I just don't happen to be a member of that audience. I grew up during the heyday of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy. Now, those guys were funny. Chappelle is about as funny as Steve Urkel. Come to think of it, Urkel has had funnier moments. And now I have to type some nonsense to get up to IMDb's required 10 lines. Bear with me while I do this. At least my filler is funnier than anything Chappelle ever uttered.
