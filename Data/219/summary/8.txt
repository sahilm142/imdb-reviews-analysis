 I can't believe people are slating this movie!

 The Lost Boys go West

 For a gunman, you're one hell of a pessimist <U+0085> Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid

 Shared billing of Newman and Redford make a classic

 Brilliant Western

 The Last Free Riders

 Excellent "modern" western

 Solid western about two personalities

 I don't love it but I've grown to like it

 Good acting and powerful script. A likable westerner!

 great buddy movie

 One of the more original and entertaining movies.

 The Best Western of All-Time

 Still Amuses.

 the plot is conventional, but the talents of Newman, Redford, and Hill combined make it stand out above many of its fellow Westerns and earn it its place as a classic

 Redford And Newman

 One Of The Best Old Westerns.

 A fun, comical, and very western adventure!

 Not Your Typical Western, But All The better For It

 Humorous depiction of the end of the western era. These were the last 2 real western cowboys, but they had fun while it lasted.

 Stylized, but may not fit everyone's taste.
