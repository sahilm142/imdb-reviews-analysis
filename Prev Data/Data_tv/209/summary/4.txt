 Ricky Gervais's Sermon to the Grumps

 Poor but somewhat watchable

 Disappointed again

 Seen it all before

 Just no

 Same old predictable Gervais

 Sharp and dark, rapdly turns into apalling sentimentaity

 Meh

 More of the same

 Dire

 Zzzzz

 God Awful

 Boring

 Oasis

 Mostly bad fat shaming jokes
