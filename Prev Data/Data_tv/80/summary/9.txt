 Spoiler the best show i have seen in a long time

 This is not your father's Battlestar Galactica

 Excellent - For Healthy Adults

 A Great Show of any Genre distinguishes itself from most

 Surprisingly deep, impressively done

 The television series of the future

 I've watched it all before and I'll watch it all again!

 Worth watching.

 Brilliant show that is accessible not only to sci-fi fans but to all

 Outstanding series

 A Great Sci-Fi Epic

 A high quality TV show which should not be missed at any cost!!!

 Pretty much...brilliant.

 I didn't want it to ever end

 A new type of science-fiction

 Reboot is so much more original than the original

 The best show on TV, and superior to the original series

 Definitely Not the Battlestar Galactica of the 80's, but that's also a GOOD THING!

 Finally a remake worthy watching

 Very dark and full of curveballs!

 The best Sci-Fi Series ever done.

 Galactica - Down to Earth

 Knocked it out of the park!

 Really well done

 BSG is simply the best TV show in years!!!
