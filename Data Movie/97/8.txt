Well-made film from Harper Lee's controversial but justly-celebrated book with Gregory Peck standing pensively tall and mighty as Atticus Finch, one of the most warmly regarded literary figures of the past century. Mary Badham does sterling work as a young white girl in the South watching with interest as her lawyer-father defends a black man on trial for raping a white woman. The coming-of-age dramatics and the rural atmospherics are ladled smoothly but thickly, and the juxtaposition with the heated courtroom theatrics is a bit bumpy; still, all the trial scenes are riveting, and Peck certainly earns his Best Actor Oscar with his fatherly approach and quiet grace. The film is difficult at times and perhaps tries too hard at others (it has a heavy spirit), but it's also quite rich as a character-study and it has a profound affect on many people. *** from ****


                
Splendid and flavorful rendition based on bestselling novel written by Harper Lee , being perfectly scripted by Horton Foote . The film takes place from the summer of 1932 to October 31, 1933 , Atticus Finch, (Gregory Peck's favorite work , who earned a deserved Academy Award) , a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man (Brock Peters) against an undeserved rape charge . Meanwhile , he attempts to explain proceedings to his kids (Mary Badham , Philip Alford) , trying to understand life and against social prejudice . The most beloved and widely read Pulitzer Prize Winner by Harper Lee now comes vividly alive on the screen in this magnificent picture , being leisurely narrated and stunningly filmed . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay by Horton Foote who also earned an Oscar along with Gregory Peck . Well realized and deliberately paced ; being a powerful retelling , including evocative settings , appropriate cinematography in white and black by cameraman Russell Harlan and rousing musical score . Extraordinary acting by Gregory Peck as a small-town advocate at law who defends an African-American accused of rape . Support cast is frankly well ; cast members such as Mary Badham (Scout), film debut by Robert Duvall (Boo), Frank Overton (Heck Tate), Collin Wilcox Paxton (Mayella), Ruth White , Richard Hale , Paul Fix , and William Windom (Mr. Gilmer) , being narrated by Kim Stanley . Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Oscar nomination, ironically losing the award to another child actress, Patty Duke in The miracle worker (1962). Special mention to Brock Peters , as an inmate , wrongly accused as rapist ; he started to cry while shooting the testifying scene, without rehearsing it this way, and Gregory Peck said that he had to look past him, instead of looking him in the eye, without choking up himself . With the death of Rosemary Murphy (Maudie Atkinson) on July 5, 2014, Robert Duvall (Boo Radley) is the film's last surviving adult cast member . Sensitive as well as evocative musical score by the great Elmer Bernstein ; the piano in Elmer Bernstein's score was played by John Williams . Adequate production and set design , as Art directors Alexander Golitzen and Henry Bumstead had an entire reconstruction of the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, built on the Universal backlot at a cost of $225,000 , as the set contained more than 30 buildings . The motion picture was magnificently directed by Robert Mulligan . Robert's way of handling his child actors was to let them play together while keeping the cameras as unobtrusive as possible. It is the first of six films director Robert Mulligan made with his producer partner, Alan J. Pakula . Director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula traveled to Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville but found it unsuitable for filming , the town had been modernized ; therefore the production team constructed their own ideal version of Monroeville on a backlot at Universal . Robert Mulligan was a good filmmaker expert on dramas such as he proved in ¨Bloodbrothers¨ , ¨Baby the rain must fall¨, ¨Kiss me goodbye¨ , ¨Same time , next year¨ , ¨The Nickel Ride¨, ¨The man in the moon¨ , being his greatest successes the followings : the eerie tale of supernatural titled ¨The other¨, the adolescent drama ¨Summer of 42¨ and this ¨¨To kill a mockingbird¨ . The latter ranked #1 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre "Courtroom Drama" and in 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #25 Greatest Movie of All Time.


                
The film is unique in it's viewpoint, being that of the children in the movie and especially that of it's narrator , the girl "scout".With that viewpoint, the film deals with mature adult matters as seen through the children's eyes. It thrusts us into their world with their playfulness and fears, especially from their mad next door Neighbor.There are certain scenes that are depicted as horror with the right lighting and music to accompany them , for it is the childhood fears that are depicted there , thus letting us experience it through their eyes.The children are there in almost every scene, whether as witnesses or as the main attention. The child actors give some of the best performances I have ever seen of actors their age. They truly behave like kids do, and not like child actors acting as children, they are truly believable. And let's not forget Gregory Peck giving one of his best performances as the loving protecting father on one side, and the protector of justice on the other, as he is defending an innocent black man in the racist American south.In conclusion a great family drama, told with tenderness and care, depicted through the eyes of the children.


                
I suggest you read the novel. You can get used books so cheap, anywhere online or in a local bookstore. They need the support. And this book is great. It was the first one I had picked up just for recreational reading after not having done that in a while. I think it is a really important read, and now more relevant than it probably has been for a while, which says less about the novel and more about the times we live in. It is short and written beautifully. So no excuse. But if you're reading this because you're in the mood to watch some old black and white movie and can't decide, I'd recommend La battaglia di Algeri or 12 Angry Men, which are superior movies in my opinion. As for this one, I say read the novel first, then watch the movie. It's good.


                
This movie is a very faithful retelling of the classic novel of the same name. Faithfulness seems to be one of the main goals of this film; Even though colored film was very possible in 1962, they intentionally chose to film the movie in black-and-white in order to capture the feel of the 1930s setting. It also does a good job at tackling the themes of racism and discrimination in a manner significantly less vulgar than you'd expect, though I'll avoid going into details to keep this relatively spoiler-free. Every aspect of the film is finely crafted. The child actors, despite their youth, do a great job at portraying their characters' emotions and stances changing throughout the film. The music intentionally plays primarily in scenes involving the children, whereas scenes focusing on grown-up Atticus have none to emphasize the essentially different world that the children and adults live in. The camera also uses a lot of low shots pointed upwards to emphasize how small the children are. It's a finely crafted film that allows you to pick up on different details every time you watch it.


                
The most interesting part of this film in my opinion was the court scene. It didn't quite sit well with me, considering that the man was guilty after his lawyer proved his innocence. The obvious reason the man was seen to be guilty was based on his race. His lawyer basically got a confession that the woman lied about being raped, yet the court still found the man to be guilty. Like I said, this was an interesting scene to me, but it also didn't sit well with me. I hated how everyone in that room was so hateful of a man because of his race, that they chose to go along with a lying woman and her disgusting father. But luckily, the father died at the end of the movie, and I like how the lawyers daughter quoted something her father said towards the end of the film
I can't help but wonder what Atticus Finch would be like in today's world and what sort of thing he would stand up against. He might be impressed with how far racism has come since the '30's, but I'm sure there is some other injustice that would similarly upset him. Certainly he would have a thing or two to say about this generation of parenting. I think he would probably not be into a lot of the group rallies and such that go on today, but rather would just try to change people's hearts doing what he does best just as he does in his own setting.Showing the story through the mostly innocent view of Scout and Jem is great for us as an audience. It forces us to look at the injustices shown in innocent and mostly unprejudiced eyes. Jem and Scout are introduced to some of the evils of the world through Atticus' court case, but are still able to help him do his job in their own way. Much of the original story is cut, but I thought the screenwriters did a good job choosing what was most important to show. Tom Robinson's court case and the children's investigation of Boo Radley are the only two plot threads that are fully maintained. The subplots involving various town events and some affairs within the Finch's extended family are chopped. The court hearing is also moved to a later and more dramatic position than in the book, which I wouldn't dispute.Jem and Scout do not take any major actions that move the story, but feel like active characters in their learning the ways of the world and the way people are prone to act. They seem to be good kids, though not always obedient or wise. Still, they seem to respect and understand the reasons behind Atticus discipline of them, which reflects well on both parties. Atticus is almost too good to be true as a person, but I could believe that someone in his position could be as upright a person as he is. I think his saying that he couldn't live with himself if he didn't defend Tom Robinson is proof of his moral fallibility. Most of the other characters, while prominent, are not worth talking about apart from the Ewell's. They are a prototype of white trash that cheat the system and don't contribute to society while taking from those who do. The unseen villains however are the socially pressured members of the jury that condemn Tom Robinson to his death.The three kids did a much better job acting than is usual of child actors. They felt like actual kids and didn't give the impression that they were just being cute for the adult audience members. Gregory Peck also gives a great performance. The Ewell's actors are a little hard to judge since the characters are putting on appearances themselves. I suppose the actors found a sweet spot of believable deceptiveness. Heck Tate, Calpurnia, Maudie Atkinson, and Tom Robinson's actors all give decent showings. Robert Duvall doesn't exactly perform as Boo Radley, but he looked perfect for the character even though I had imagined Boo Radley much differently. The camera work seemed pretty good even though some of it felt a little bit cheesy. The script was adapted quite well and kept the pace up and never lets you feel bored.I would recommend this to almost everyone, though it's not the pinnacle of entertainment. It does make you a more conscious person and calls you to consider what prejudices you might have clouding your judgment. If you don't like old movies or material that seems "boring", I can understand where you're coming from, but would still encourage you to see this through as a form of self-improvement. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.
Never had watched this til tonite. What a movie. Lovely performances by those kids, Peck is top-notch, Brock Peters is moving, the rest of the character actors-Duvall, Windom, Fix-are all good too.This movie just felt right-the setting was very southern, the townsfolk moved around like poor people in the depression in the summer heat, things just had a unique ebb and feel to them here you don't see in films much now.I have only the one minor quibble w/ it-starts out as a very well done kids in a southern town thing, then it's onto the court stuff. I didn't think they brought out enough of the actual rape case early enough. Yes I know it was from the kids point of view, but still...Minor point as I said. This holds up quite well and is worth your watching. You just knew Brock Peters was going to get it, so clearly was he a martyr.**** outta **** do check this one out.
TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD opens with a female narrator describing the small town she was raised in, her poetic drawl and the lilt of her language dropping us smack in 1933 Alabammy - "recently told we had nothing to fear but fear itself" - just after the crash heralding the Great Depression; you know, the REAL Depression.From the 1960 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Harper Lee, this movie, this tale itself, at first seems like a stream of Southern consciousness reminiscence, as we follow 10-year-old Jem (Phillip Alford) and his younger tomboy sister Scout (Mary Badham) on their daily adventures, with big-eared pal, Dill (John Megna). But MOCKINGBIRD is a crafty coming of age tale; what the kids believe to be their comforting haven - the tired town of Maycomb - turns out to have whitey fangs, and the person whom their wayward fantasies paint as a lunatic killer of children - their unseen neighbor, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall) - is ultimately a mundane dark angel.Lording over the proceedings, Gregory Peck as Jem and Scout's respectable pater, Atticus Finch - wise lawyer, moral pillar, the father we all wish we had; this legendary role cementing him so powerfully as the subdued, majestic voice of reason, at times it seems like Atticus Finch is doing Gregory Peck.To the kids, Atticus is an old fogey, too timid to let Jem wield a gun like the other kids, never letting Scout fight at school - until new-found respect dawns in their eyes when Atticus shoots down a rabid dog with one shot, Sheriff Heck extolling him as the "best shot in the county"; until Atticus represents a black man in court, the black community standing silently, poignantly, in respect for him, "Stand up, Scout. Your daddy is passing." The title is a metaphor for the main plot. Atticus tells his kids of the sin of killing a mockingbird. "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us." A person who would kill a mockingbird must be a special kind of crazy. Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), the black man whom Atticus defends, is accused of raping a white woman, and after all evidence points to the woman's father beating her, after Atticus gives a racism speech that would make Obama proud - yet Tom is convicted. "And the all-white jury agreed." Before Atticus can request an appeal, Tom is killed for trying to escape.Jem and Scout sit through the whole trial, their respect for their father growing as large as their disillusionment with the justice system.In what seems like a coda to the movie, Boo Radley's identity is revealed, robbing the kids of the last of their illusions. The child actors are magnificent, even outpacing the great Duvall in his first film role playing nothing more than a gentle, enigmatic mute.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is vibrant with the spirit of America - everything that made America - the intolerance and the acceptance, the killing of innocence and the crushing of human spirit; the poverty and the small towns where that poverty emanated from; and the children who would see injustice and one day work to thwart it.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).
Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, this movie combines truth with fiction to illustrate a certain time in America's history. It takes a while to suss out the nature of this movie or what it's about. So, we're sort of like the nominal central character of the movie, "Scout" (Mary Badham), the young daughter of Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), a hick town lawyer in America's Deep South (in the 1930s). Therefore, the early part of the movie has Scout be the centre of attention along with her childish concerns and relations with her younger brother and a new friend who is visiting.Later, this child centred point of view comes to encompass more adult concerns and, particularly, a legal case Atticus Finch has decided to take on...the defence of a black man charged with raping, I think, a white woman. At first, Atticus, seen from the children's' point of view is nothing special or exceptional. One of the pleasures of this movie is how their father transforms into someone to celebrate.Brilliantly evoking an America which existed even as little as 40 odd years ago, this movie and the book it was based on must have seemed a pebble in the shoe to a country which eulogised itself and its virtues.Finch, in court, is a quiet and smouldering figure exemplifying integrity and the pursuit of justice. Perhaps the court scenes aren't the most realistic ever filmed but the evidence conveyed is plausible and lucid. In fact, it's superior to the jury deliberations found in "12 angry men" which are somewhat logically jumpy. In other words, this movie seems to want to keep the court room evidence to a minimum for fear of boring us. It's brevity isn't a major flaw though.Sensitive issues are dealt with subtly in Mockingbird, but I do wonder if the fate of Finch's client was glossed over superficially without Finch type analysis from the film makers...or author?In black and white. Check out "The curse of the Cat People" which I review here and also deals with the world of childhood.


                
what is it that makes this film different and so much better then many other similar films? well first of all it has the great Atticus Finch (Gregory Pack) in it, who delivers an outstanding heroic and historic acting performance, that will make it hard for each and every one to stay indifferent to.second of all, after watching it it will be clear that it is not just one more film that comes to tell us a civil rights story in which the black person turns out to be the victim.in my opinion the whole Tom Robinson story in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is only secondary.it is a good connection between the children and their fathers enemy that thanks to his attack the real mockingbird of the story is revealed.you can try for hours but trust me this is the only way in which a person like Atticus Finch could create himself a true enemy, by representing and protecting someone that is hated.with Tom Robinson being secondary we are left with the children being what makes this film so great.Jem, Dill and Scout that the whole film is narrated through her eyes.we get the summer adventures of those three children's childhood years and even if this doesn't sound too exciting it is just an extraordinary thing to watch.'To Kill A Mockingbird' is simply unforgettable, a film that will stick with you long after you finish watching it.


                
To Kill a mockingbird is my number 145 movie. It is very original and the actors are great. I usually do not like black&white-movies, but this movie is an exception ( but it is not the only one ). The film is about Atticus ( Gregory Peck ) who is the lawyer of a black man, and that is why he loses his authority in the town. All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and I recommend it to fans of serious films. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.


                
When I was in high school, I had to read the book. I was not a fan of the book at all, but then again I had no care for the idea of reading back then. After reading it, we also had to watch the movie. Again, I was not a fan of it. But, re-watching it now, I have come to realize that in fact it really was a great film. It had great camera work, lighting, and fantastic actors to it all. I am sure that Harper was very proud of how her book came out into the adaptation of a film, because it is in fact a spectacular film where you feel immersed into the entirety of it. You feel like you're in the court room during the case, in the houses of the characters, and have feelings for when all the action takes place. It truly is a fantastic film. Maybe it is time to go and reread the book as well.


                
To Kill A Mockingbird is a great example of a book adaptation gone right. It knows what details to keep and which ones to leave alone, and therefore creates a sympathetic, complex, cohesive film. The way the film handles race, class, childhood and poverty, was not made this film stand out at the time it was released, but is relevant even now. All of the performances here are really stellar, but Gregory Peck's performance of Atticus Finch and Brock Peters performance of Tom Robinson are the stand outs. The emotion and dedication both bring to their roles is astounding. Every time Atticus is on screen, he steals the show. The character's quiet compassion and brilliance are really translated well to the film, and he really holds the film together. For me, the parts that fall a little more flat are mostly the parts that have to do with Scout, which is a shame considering she's our main character. It's not that she's performed poorly or anything, but often times shots linger on her for too long or the writing for her is just not very good. The child acting in this movie is overall very good, with Phillip Alford's portrayal of Jem being the highlight. Dill and Scout are more just okay than anything else, but it isn't a detrimental things at all. The main problems I have with the film are all hinged on the way Scout is written. Sometimes just seems to do things for no other reason than to progress the plot, rather than to actually contribute to the message of the film. All in all though, To Kill A Mockingbird is a poignant film that I can easily recommend. 8.9/10


                
To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books, and it was amazing to see the characters come alive on the screen. Gregory Peck is absolutely perfect as Atticus Finch, the intelligent and kind father of Scout and Jem, and Robert Duvall is able to depict Boo Radley's deep pain without saying a word. One amazing thing about this film is the way that it is from the perspective of a child. Director Robert Mulligan is able to flawlessly translate this from the book, and ensures that it does not falter throughout the movie. The black-and- white cinematography is evocative of the 1930s Deep South, but To Kill a Mockingbird is not just a period piece. Unfortunately, its portrayal of racism and a corrupt legal system are still relevant today. It is an important film in terms of style and content, and one that I will definitely be seeing again.


                
This was some bold subject matter, and it is semi-autobiographical. The movie came out two years after the book, and the fact that Civil Rights was still going on is why this was all such a big deal. What really shows the risk factor, is how such a divisive issue is shown through the eyes of Scout, and not Atticus. It's a great idea, and really gives some thought provoking insight by framing such a big issue through the eyes of a young, precocious child. This also serves as a great way to educate children on the issue. The performances all around are brilliant. The kids are great and likable (which is quite a rarity), Robert Duvall makes a stunning film debut, Brock Peters is agonizingly sympathetic and compelling as Robinson, and then we get the man who really shines above all: Gregory Peck. This was a much deserved Oscar winning and career defining performance for him, and it really is one of the greats. He's wonderful through the whole thing, and he comes off as the kind of dad a person would love to have as their own. What seals the deal though is his lengthy courtroom monologue. I get all kinds of shaken and emotionally stirred up every time I watch that scene. It's some of the most powerful, riveting, and memorable acting ever put on film.


                
Cognizant of my manifold rich taste in movies, a dear friend had unsuccessfully tried to convince me for many years to watch "To Kill a Mocking Bird". I finally got around to watching it, now thats its available on Netflix. Here are my two cents about the movie. The only other American classic I've watched is "12 angry men" and it seems that the slow narrative cinematography was the zeitgeist But there is no doubt in my mind that this is an epic movie. The first three quarters of the movie took me back to my childhood. The mannerisms and the social setting was very similar. "Scout", "Jem" and "Dill's" artlessness was extremely charming. Don't misconstrue my review, it was not only humorous and affable but carried a very strong and pertinent message for the era
'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a well-adapted story about morality. I like how half the movie establishes the different characters, and the remaining half deals with the case and town's attitude. The movie maintains proper pace and doesn't seem to be in a rush, and that really works for it. The acting by everyone involved is quite commendable; in this film, we see the dashing young Robert Duvall for the first time. I really like how it shows how a parent's attitude towards certain things really shapes a child. Our attitude towards things are always shaped by the people around us.AFI named Peck's character as the number one hero of all-time; their choice was really interesting seeing the age of heroes (different kind) we live in.


                
To Kill a Mockingbird is a story that encompasses the racial issues of its time. Although it is a serious and, "grown up" topic, the movie is easy to follow and relate to for all ages. Atticus Finch is a well-to-do lawyer, who goes against social norms by representing a black man, (Tom Robinson) who is falsely accused of rape. There is dramatic irony in the sense that the audience is aware that Tom is innocent, but people in Alabama don't want to believe it. This is a gut-wrenching factor, as you can feel nothing but sympathy for the mistreatment this innocent man faces. I find the most moving part of this film to be the morals that Atticus works to implement on his children Scout & Jem. Although they are growing up in a highly segregated era, they are open-minded and kind to all who are kind to them, regardless of the stereotypes surrounding them. The movie does an excellent job reflecting the time period, through the use of derogatory language and clear separation of the races. For example, in the courthouse, blacks mustn't sit on the first floor. Instead, they are to watch from the balcony. Moreover, the most obvious example of separation is the fact that Tom Robinsons guilt is hardly questioned. And although the defense does an excellent job exposing the true culprit, Tom's ethnicity is enough to label him a rapist.


                
To Kill A Mockingbird is a movie that effectively shows the evils of racism in the nineteen thirties in the south. Gregory Peck plays the calm and collected lawyer, Atticus, who valiantly defends a black man in racist Maycomb Alabama. He does a wonderful job of portraying the Atticus Finch as he struggles to prove the man's innocence. He plays the character as Harper Lee describes him in the book, which is a great factor for me. I love that the book and the movie are very closely associated. I was very impressed with Mary Badham's performance as Scout. She properly displays Scout's innocence and that is a huge theme in the book. Scout's discovery of the racism within her town shows the malicious behaviors of the white people and the mistreatment of the black community. This movie properly represents the mistreatment of the black community and that is another factor that is appealing to me. It shows the cruelty of the whites and creates empathy within the viewer. I highly recommend this film for any person interested in civil rights. This movie and book shows the start of the fight for equal rights for African Americans in the United States. Go see it! It's great!


                
The movie opens mildly, looking like a children's adventure movie. Then little by little the more serious theme of racial prejudice seeps in and gain more focus until the touching transition scene with Atticus and the country folk after Tom. The scene really was great both emotionally and technically. It transitions smoothly from the children adventure subject to the serious rape charge clouded in racial prejudice subject. Emotionally, the scene may have stirred something in people's minds about what they were doing wrong; the racial segregation issue. Gregory Peck acted quite flat on the expressions, but his dialog and body language parts are quite good.


                
I watched the movie ''To kill a mockingbird'' yesterday after telling myself that a would for two years. It turned out it's one of my favorite films ever! I had read the book a few years back and then I just needed to watch the movie adaptation. Even though this is an old film, the plot is fantastic and I really enjoyed it. The quality is not the best and that's the only reason I didn't give it a 10/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a good taste! I hope you watch it and love it as I did. Oh, and if your a bookworm - like me - you should immediately read the book! And as I said before great film. Don't let the fact that it's old stop you from enjoying it!


                
Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, an Alabama lawyer who is called upon to defend a black man(played by Brock Peters) who is wrongfully accused of raping a white woman(played by Collin Wilcox) in the 1930's, where such an allegation could get him lynched before a trial. Story also includes Atticus's two children Scout & Jem, and the film is mostly seen from their POV, as they try to understand what's going on and why. Robert Duvall plays a mysterious figure named Boo Radley(played by Robert Duvall) who will have a huge impact on their lives.Superb film with an Academy Award winning performance by Gregory Peck, and fine direction by Robert Mulligan, who creates an evocative atmosphere of small town Alabama life of this period, and the wonder yet naivety of childhood.A first-rate adaptation of Harper Lee's famous novel.


                
"To Kill a Mockingbird" is a movie based on Harper Lee's book of 1961 (Pulitzer Prize winning). It's a movie that displays the racial racism of the time (1930s) and how people treat each other in such times.It all starts when a black man (Brock Peters) accused of raping a white woman and Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch) represent him as his lawyer. When villagers learn about this representation of Atticus Finch they want to change his mind but Atticus decides to go ahead of it.I liked very much the performances of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch a lawyer who fights for justice and of course the performances of the two little ones (son and daughter of Atticus Finch) Mary Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem. I recommend it because I think that this movie shows us a different treatment of a black man in those times from a white man.


                
I enjoyed reading dweck (An Unforgettable Drama, 9 December 1998) and sylviastel@aol.com (Please Don't Remake This Film!, 23 February 2008)."To Kill a Mockingbird" is an acting showcase, where everyone who appears is very good. Three actors I have enjoyed from "Star Trek" and "Twilight Zone" and who fit into the landscape here are Paul Fix, Frank Overton and William Windom. Phillip Alford as Jem and John Megna as Dill are good children actors. James Anderson and Collin Wilcox Paxton as the Ewell father and daughter are both filled with spite. Brock Peters is convincing as the accused rapist. Robert Duvall makes a memorable appearance as Boo Radley very late in the show.The two acting standouts are Gregory Peck as Atticus and Mary Badham as Scout. Peck immerses himself so thoroughly as Atticus that it is difficult imagining anyone else appearing here. Atticus is cinema's limit as the dignified and moral lawyer struggling to prevent mob rule from holding sway.Mary Badham should have won the supporting Oscar she was nominated for. She has great depth and range for a child actor. (It is a pity her career was so limited.) The credit sequence is pretty interesting. Elmer Bertstein's music, with jazzy piano, is also well done.The trial scenes are effective despite how easy it should be to defend a man accused of being a left-handed rapist who can't use his left arm at all.The only weakness that 'Mockingbird' has is the direction. There isn't a single image from director Robert Mulligan that is uniquely memorable. He's competent but not elite. His Oscar nomination is difficult to understand.'Mockingbird' is an important film for people to see today. Before Guantanamo Bay eviscerated it, America used to be a Constitutional Republic. In the 1960s there were many cultural references on behalf of the US legal system. While America continues to advance the use of illegal, extra-Constitutional star chambers (e.g., Guantanamo Bay), 'Mockingbird' shows us that it was once considered shocking for justice to be so clearly denied.
