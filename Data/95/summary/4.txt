 Terrible movie, disappointed Tarantino fan

 An uneven mess

 Wow, Tarantino goes from Hero to zero

 Where Tarantino fantasizes about dirty war in war<U+0085>

 A dangerous and irresponsible film from a director who used to be great...

 Hitler's Table Talk

 Fanboy directors fantasies---

 Nothing more than American chest beating.

 so so

 Masterpiece? Guess again...

 Bring on the hate

 A long, sad and boring decadence

 Not so glorious violence

 Underwhelmed

 Interesting at first, but then nothing but unnecessary violence

 Christoph Waltz - an Oscar performance within a pile!

 Pretty weak

 you gotta be kidding me

 Yakkety Yak Yak Yak

 Typical Tarantino overwhelms World War II fantasy

 Excited to see it...left VERY disappointed

 Okay send up of the Euro-war film is for fans of Tarantino's dialog only

 Not that good

 Not good

 Looks like a dog, sounds like a dog...it is a dog
