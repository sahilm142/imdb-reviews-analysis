 By and large, TV gold

 Best deconstruction of American life in the modern TV era.

 Excellent portrayal of the New Jersey Family

 One of the best shows out there

 I am going to miss this show..

 Great characters, great setting, good story.

 Audiences with be married to the mob each week: was it worth it? Yes, so do watch.

 Just a thing

 Watching it all over again.

 Lightly worse than expected

 The start of HBO's illustrious career

 Maybe will be studied in schools of the future

 Fodder for tv junkies. Serious film fans look elsewhere.

 The best hour long drama in 20 years.

 Amazing

 One of the greatest shows it will be missed.

 The Box Set Pod

 Intriguing

 I watched most of the episodes!

 "The Sopranos" is most intriguing when we personally get to know Mr. Soprano

 A Mob Epic Spanning Several Years, Is The Greatest Show On Earth

 A insight in the mafia through the eyes of a troubled man

 Refreshingly un-PC.

 Incisive

 Excellent -- but walks a very loose moral tightrope.
