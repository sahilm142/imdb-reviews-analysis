Watched the first episode. As others have said, the writing and acting on this show is awful. Every dramatic moment was contrived and inauthentic. But the clincher was the dance audition. There is no way the childish schmuck who decided not to submit his application to the school was given an audition to start with, but his sassy friend used her sass to convince the administrators to let him do it. The real kicker is that, after all that, he can't dance! Really, he would be kicked out of a high school production of Brigadoon if he danced like that. Then the amateurish editing, with haphazard cuts, not only made me nauseous, tried to cover up the crime. No dice and no "Pose" for me.
