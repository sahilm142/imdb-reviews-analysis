 Booooooring.

 Over rated

 minority opinion

 teenage romance disguised as sci-fi

 Ambitious, Interesting... and Utterly Insubstantial

 Very pretentious and way over-hyped

 Mostly unsuccessful

 Did I miss something?

 Watch "Donnie Darko" only if you are impressed by its 'cult film' status.

 Deep, too deep but to be honest not deep enough.

 Not My Cup of Tea

 A Lot of People Love This Movie, I Didn't

 Film is about a lunatic

 Could have been really good, but...

 Forget the cutting room floor, it's on director Richard Kelly's brain pan

 what is this doing in the "top 250"?

 interesting but disappointing.

 Caution: Spoilers ahead!

 Nice try at a deep movie, but boring at its roots.

 Overrated.

 Donnie Dorko

 Great movie if think school doesn't already give enough homework.

 Lots of nice aspects, but ultimately disappointing

 Disappointed

 Jake Gyllenhaal and the sepulchral coney [Spoilers for the uninitiated]
