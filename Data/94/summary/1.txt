 What is it with this movie?

 Why This Film is a Classic is a Profound Mystery

 A Major Borefest

 Beep! Beep! Honk! Honk!

 An insufferable bore

 Taxi Driver = Horribly Over rated

 "characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness"

 dumb standard gun-story

 seriously .. what was that ?? and why on earth its among the 250 best movies list ?

 Its awful, full of flaws to be called a masterpiece

 Stupid Movie

 Two hours of my life I'll never see again!

 Boring as hell

 This movie SUCKED

 Bad, worse than worst.

 one of the biggest trash of all time

 Typical 70'ies trash...

 Worst director ever

 Disgusting vulgar filth

 a praise for murder not a master piece

 133 minutes of nonsense

 De Niro wears an unconvincing fake moustache.

 Just don't waste your time on this movie

 To summarize, it is ridiculous to say its a masterpiece, its NOT

 Zero real life
