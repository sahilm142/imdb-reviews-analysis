 Racist and predictable

 It's probably me, but I did not like this movie

 Of mice and men... and murderers.

 Excellent performances, good story line, very predictable

 Uncle Tom is now a faith healer on Death Row

 Sappier than a tree

 Politically correct nothingness

 Unbelievably Hypocritical

 A waste of an opportunity

 Green Miles and miles and .....

 The Green Light

 More than three hours of torture!

 I'm going to go against the grain here...

 Entertaining movie but with childish magical elements, failed to touch me

 The Green Mile

 Overblown Treatment of Slight Story

 Nothing great

 Mixed reactions...

 Is it over yet?

 Incomplete and trite.

 Punishing.

 Am I missing something?

 Let's play God's card and see what happens...

 Not Sliders

 Not a film, more a t.v. mini-series
