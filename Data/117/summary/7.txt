 Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece about a laconic masterless samurai who sells his services to two different warlords

 While not perfect, Kurosawa/Mifune and that guy with the pistol make this movie work!

 At The Gate Of Hell ... I'll Wait For You There

 "Everyone in this town is crazy. But you're even crazier."

 A new, less satisfying direction for Kurosawa

 3.5 out of 5 stars

 Clint Eastwood had better thank these guys.

 One of the films that inspired Sergio Leone in the trilogy of Dollars

 This Town Ain't Big Enough

 One of the best from Akira Kurosawa...
