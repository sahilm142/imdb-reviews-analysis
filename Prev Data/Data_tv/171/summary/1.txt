 Another Drama Turned Into a Soap Opera

 Use to love this show, now I kinda like it.

 Used to be good

 Empty. Painful. Unwatchable.

 Just another soap opera now

 Butchering of Norse mythology, history, and culture!

 Let's see the Vikings as they really were

 Dont bother

 Ultimately, it's just boring.

 Gone downhill Fast

 this series has successfully made history a joke

 terrible series

 So damn boring!

 From 10 stars to 1

 Violent porno

 What a silly series

 Overrated

 Waste of time

 Has many issues

 From Norse to Worse

 Vikings Was Interesting but Has Gotten Stupid

 Avoid

 Historically inaccurate

 Poor

 One Viking Is Able To Kill 100 Without So Much As A Scratch
