Okay, I am going to put this lightly: This is literally the stupidest "film" I have ever watched.The plot is hard to follow, it starts slow, the "humor" in it is not funny whatsoever, it's all perverted, childish, or dumb. If you actually appreciate decent musicals, don't watch this. It's a waste of time. I honestly don't know why the reviews are so high. The characters are not at all personable, it's extremely slow, cheesy, boring, and not interesting or engaging. My friend made me watch it with her and I wasted 42 minutes of my life. The acting sucked too. Definitely not worth your time or money. Skip this and watch a good film.


                
Wow, I hardly know what to say after reading all the other comments here. We rented this thing from Netflix, having no idea that it was only 43 minutes long, so right off the bat I was more than a little ticked that we wasted a rental on something so short. However, it came so highly recommended from their site that I was looking forward to it. Yes, there are some witty song lyrics and some of the music is even fairly nice, but overall this was a waste of...well, 43 minutes. I can't recommend this to anyone other than maybe some bored 12-year-olds who enjoy scatological humor (and what 12-year-old doesn't?). I enjoy tongue-in-cheek more than most, as does my husband, but we were both very grateful when this thing reached the end credits.
