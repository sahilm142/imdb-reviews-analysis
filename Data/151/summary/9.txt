 A tense and compelling film

 A Harrowing Film with Incredible Performances!

 Awesome film - shame about the trailer

 room is perfect

 Claustrophobic beauty

 Inside out

 Probably one of the best films of the year!

 Everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'!

 ROOM is an Emotional Juggernaut; One of 2015's Top Films

 So brilliantly conceived and performed it's almost as if you were viewing a documentary.

 Room

 Gripping from start to finish

 Absolutely a must watch!

 The best movie of 2015

 Splash! A wake up call!......beyond the room....
