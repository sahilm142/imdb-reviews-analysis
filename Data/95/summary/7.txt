 The Jewish Scalphunters of Quentin Tarantino

 He loves his movies, doesn't he?

 Worst QT movie to date!

 A great movie if you don't take yourself so seriously

 just good but over rated,big secret behind this very high rating

 Self Indulgent Cocaine Induced Stupor

 Detectives

 Initial reaction: surprise, pleasure and disappointment.

 Entertaining but Tarantino is stuck in revenge fantasy mode.

 Messy and indecisive

 Inglouriously uncomfortable

 A half masterpiece

 Tarantino is back!

 One too many turns of the screw; and surprisingly pro-German.

 So, apparently you either love this film or hate it.

 Adult puberty?

 Some flashes of Tarantino gold, also Nazis

 More serious and deeper than most Tarantino films

 I saw many bad reviews for a film rated so highly

 What shall the history books read?

 this movie just not like the way I expected.

 Long, Gory, and Not Quite Glourious

 Jewish Fantasy Fulfilled?

 Fun but flawed

 Tarantino Fails
