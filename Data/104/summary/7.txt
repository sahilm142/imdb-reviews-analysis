 Good golly Miss Molly! One of a kind!

 An energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors.

 "Snatch" is not a good movie, but done in a very entertaining style that many people will enjoy. I laughed a lot.

 The sequel

 A fantastic black comedy that will have you in splits

 Black comedy at its finest

 Guy Ritchie's magnus Opus

 Style reigns over content. Still an enjoyable watch, if you dont expect more than a good B movie..

 Cool action-film!
