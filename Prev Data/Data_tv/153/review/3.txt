Let's see... My experience watching the Eric Andre show is a bit hard to describe. After they have been plugging this program for months on Adult Swim, I finally committed myself to watching a couple episodes. On both occasions I am left feeling disoriented. Like I ate acid in a crowded airport or something of the sort. This show's idea of comedy is so random and strange. I love lunatic fringe as much as the next weirdo, but this is really out there. On a positive note, the show does leave me feeling a bit curious to see what other outrageous things they will cook up. Also, Eric and Hannibal have a great chemistry on screen. Its not so bad. I'd prefer it over the likes of Children's hospital or Check it out, but that really doesn't say a whole lot.
