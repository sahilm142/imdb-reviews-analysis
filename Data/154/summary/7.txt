 wasn't enough build up, didn't make much sense

 Doesn't really do anything new but it does it right for the most part.

 Entertaining but predictable.

 A very old-school treat.

 Worth seeing but prepare for disappointment.

 Great fighting scenes, some great acting, and an OK storyline.

 Good but 8.3?? Come on!!

 Pretty darn good

 Good film, but too many fight scenes

 A family feud settled in the octagon

 Rock 'em Sock 'em Brothers

 Doesn't connect with the knockout, but wins on points.

 Terrible..Just Terrible

 Surprisingly good

 There are some *Incomplete information*

 An "I'm bored what's there to watch?" movie

 Intense

 Warrior

 A gripping sports movie with great emotional power

 The Best Fight Movie You'll Ever See... I Doubt It.

 Closer to Bloodsport than Rocky

 Most Contemporary Fighter
