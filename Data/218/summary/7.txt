 Good Movie, But a Disappointing & Unsatisfying End to the series...

 Just enjoy the MOVIE!

 Happy Birthday Harry & Goodbye (screen)

 Hallows 2 - fumbles at the goal line.

 Could have been better

 All is mostly well

 It felt, disappointing..

 Great movie but it didn't follow the book well

 Good but Disappointing

 Time for the main event, Mr. Potter.

 Great

 Action scenes and more action....

 Much improved over Part 1 and a rather satisfying way to go.

 Shoulda been a third movie. Way too rushed

 Nice conclusion to a rocky saga

 A very memorable finale'.

 The end of an era

 10 years of Harry Potter, the great ending of a great series, Thank you!

 week Battle

 And so the circle closes

 Movie should have been longer and in 2D

 go be nerdy if you have seen the other films you won't be disappointed

 The So-So Ending To An Amazing Adventure

 Worth watching but something is missing.

 A Magical End to an Incredible Saga
