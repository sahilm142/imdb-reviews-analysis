 *Yawns*

 A Major Letdown...

 5 minutes of SFX and a bad story

 Stylish, yes. But ultra boring.

 I just don't get it

 Let-down much?

 In the end, what the hell is this movie about?

 A lot of positives, but ultimately not very good.

 Bleak dystopian garbage

 Completely Below Average

 Haven't seen it yet? Don't!!! It's downright awful.

 Made by Androids, Watched by Sheep

 What do people see in this movie?

 Wha?

 Not that great. Overrated.

 the worst movie i have seen

 Harrison Ford Zero; Rutger Hauer 10+

 Significantly Overrated

 It's kind of slow, boring, and repetitive

 As shallow as the rain puddles scattered throughout the movie itself.

 No, it really isn't a good movie

 You call THIS an Action movie!?

 Such a disappointment

 A retelling of the novel's story, but without the actual story
