 Oh, those monologues.

 Show is decent.

 A disappointing ending to an otherwise great show

 9 great episodes, episode 10 is also horror, but in another sense

 Starts strong, ends poorly

 Boring !!!

 Not as good as I'd hoped.

 Could have been better!!

 Overrated and overhyped.

 Not bad but not WOW

 Worth 9 hours but not 10

 Decently good

 Interesting story telling but way too long

 A swing & a miss.

 Slow and repetitive

 Was very 'bingeable' right up till the last episode

 Finally a real Horror Tv-show! (With a disappointing ending)

 Great beginning, lame ending.

 Finally a real Horror Tv-show!

 That ending, though...why?

 slow and boring......

 Good but to many flashbacks ,forwards sideways and forward back again,to many flashbacks

 Not scary

 More a good family drama than a horror show

 After episode 8: Haunted episode of Friends...
