 Peaky Blinders Is TV History In The Making

 Visually Impeccable Anti-Hero Drama

 'Tom Hardy is outstanding'

 THIS is British drama...

 Riveting stuff

 Great from the beginning, getting better still!

 It's Decent good plot & Storyline

 It's allright but they got the seasons wrong

 Great series

 Original, Different, Profesional, Classy.

 Enjoyable, but agree with some of the criticisms from others

 Great show, not quite HBO quality

 Razor sharp

 season 4 goes to hell, the premise is silly

 the purest form of film (serie) making

 After a tedious episode 1, it is worth waiting.

 Prohabition error in plot

 One of the best

 One of the best gangsters tv-shows I have ever seen

 Every single season

 Sons of Anarchy meets 1920's Britain

 Great show but one thing totally unprofessional

 Peeeeky Bloinderz

 Good effort - could do better

 Great show but action is missing
