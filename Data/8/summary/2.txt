 Totally underwhelmed

 the most over valued film of the '90s

 One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!

 I hate this movie

 Appeal is a Complete Mystery!

 Horrible!

 I guess I just don't get it

 Not very original

 Not a very good movie

 Disturbing

 Some hilarious scenes, but nothing else to offer

 It sucks!!

 Overrated

 F this movie.

 Yet another disgrace by Tarantino.

 Over Hyped

 not funny at all

 Top #250? I must be out of the loop.

 No plot, no specific mission. Pointless, bad movie

 "The Lion King" should've been nominated for Best Picture! Not this overrated pile of nonsensical, worthless schlock!!

 What's all the fuss about?!

 Overrated

 how great is this really?

 Just Nasty

 The most over-rated film in history
