"The Sixth Sense" was a huge disappointment. If it was supposed to be a thriller, it was the dreariest thriller I've ever seen. Truthfully, I had to make an effort to stay awake during the thing so I could see how it ended. Maybe I should have seen the ending coming like a lot of other people, but I didn't. I think the reason is that it didn't make sense. I'm about to ruin the ending for you if you haven't seen the movie yet, but I know you've already seen it. So this kid who is terrified of dead people, even though you'd think he'd be used to be them by now, deals with his fear by spending all his time with a supposedly brilliant dead psychologist who goes for a year without knowing he's dead even though this troubled child is the only person he communicates with. That's the whole plot.Besides the inconsistencies in the plot, there was nothing about the movie that was the least bit scary. Yes, I get that the kid could see dead people. But that's all. They weren't trying to drown him or eat him. They were just there. One's ability to be scared by this hinges on their belief that death is in and of itself scary. But if you're not really afraid of death, which I'm not because it's inevitable, then the only thing that will sicken you will be the unrealistic, mind-numbingly dull dialogue that has become a trademark of all Shyamalan films.
When I first saw this movie I thought it was pretty good, not as great as a lot of other people seemed to think, but I really did enjoy how I did not see the ending coming. When you re-watch it though you catch why - because there's all kinds of little cheats etc that obviously make you think that ending is impossible, but they don't hold up when you already know what the ending is. Pretty sloppy and lazy. Good scam though as long as people don't watch it more than once, unfortunately for me I did though. Still much better than the one he did after this, and the one after that, and the one after that, and the one after that.


                
I'm actually not agreeing so much with the complaint that the pace of this movie is too slow. I think a slower pace can contribute to a good movie. And the acting is different enough to keep you intrigued.However the plot is so bad that I was really disappointed in the end. Half way through the movie I figured that Malcolm was dead himself, but decided again that it wasn't so. Too many events were contradicting this conclusion. So when in the end Malcolm turned out to be really dead I felt tricked. So I watched the movie back and concluded that this plot was really unrealistic and badly written.I didn't get the fuss around this movie in the 90's and still don't get it. This movie should get a very low rating, because the storyline is just terrible.
Spoilers ThroughoutI was in shock at the end of this film. But, because of how ridiculously it ended and more so because most of the questions hadn't been answered, and indeed still haven't. Up until 10 minutes from the end it was pretty good. 10 minutes later it had degenerated into a complete farce.Where do we start?Are you telling me someone can go 9 months or so without realising they're dead and not a single person speaking to, or even acknowledging him in that time? What has he been doing for food in that time? I guessed this outcome right at the start but then dismissed immediately after as it wouldn't have worked.Nobody I speak to seems to know for certain whether the child knew Bruce Willis was a ghost. If he did, then why was he not scared of him? What made Bruce so special? and did he not see the patch of blood on his mack? and how come only he can change his clothes and not appear in the state he died in?
And how come Bruce is able to lob a lump of rock at a shop window or play a tape recording yet all the other ghosts need to attract this kid to do anything. Why could the girl at the funeral not have just put her video tape somewhere where the dad would've seen it?Ghosts also go nowhere near churches and I thought maybe there might have been a link as to why either Bruce or the kid were particularly special or gifted, despite constant refererences to his past. If you look closely enough, his Wife does acknowledge him at their anniversary, so does the kids mum when he walks in their house.It does not suprise me The "Great Unwashed" of Britain and America consider this an amazing and clever ending. Anyone who has watched an Agatha Christie film would be use to it. Anyone who has watched 'Jonathan Creek' would get endings twice as brilliant and complex as this every week, where everything is resolved.
SPOILERS...... ....Everyone who saw this movie said that it was great, but for all the hype, I was very disappointed.  I REALLY don't see how anyone could not have guessed the ending, it was painfully obvious.  The man never changed his clothes, interacted with anyone.  I also don't understand how Malcolm didn't realize that something was up with him.  "Hmmmm...I don't talk to anyone and no one talks to me...wonder why?" All of the "red" clues were obvious as well, but not exactly brilliant.I also don't think this movie had much of a plot.  It just kind of moved along, at a rather boring rate.  I understand that Cole was there to help the dead people, but if that was the whole outcome...why didn't we see him helping more ghosts? Just that one girl.  They could have done a lot more. I was also waiting for more to come of Cole's dad, especially the way Malcolm emphasized it so much in the beginning.In summary, a thriller which didn't create suspense with a boring and obvious outcome. I think Haley's a good actor and did a great job, but other than that, this movie gives nothing.
Since I'm sure anyone who hasn't seen the film yet (and hasn't had it spoiled for them) has already been subjected to numerous accolades for Director M. Night Shyamalan, I'll get right to the point of my review: no, Sixth Sense is not a good movie.  It is a mass of poorly-joined, generally pointless fluff, punctuated by a hilariously-contrived and completely predictable "twist."  This is unfortunate, because due to the weakness of the material surrounding it, the entire production sinks or swims on the strength of that one plot twist.Ergo, A. If you figure it out before it happens, B. If somebody spoils it for you, or C. You're not surprised by anything in movies, then the film is absolutely worthless.Shyamalan does get bonus points for creating a creepy-as-hell atmosphere--but creepy atmosphere doesn't make a good movie.  The Sixth Sense lacks quality character development, decent performances (Bruce Willis is flat, as is Haley Joel Osment), and a plot that is involving, or at least coherent.  In place of these key factors is merely a series of unrelated events, each of which inevitably--and predictably--ends in a telegraphed "boo!" moment, complete with an atonal stab of music and a jumpy edit.  Fine for the Scream crowd, but I look for a little more intelligence in my horror movies.


                
After seeing the previews of "The Sixth Sense", I was itching to see it. The idea was great, the story seemed great.  However, after sitting through this film (along with 1000 other people in a sold-out theater), I realize that there was one thing missing - interest.  I wish I had $1 for every person that was falling asleep around me.  This film is the poster child for boring.  Once again, they lured me in with awesome previews, took my $$, and kicked me in the ass.  This film makes you feel like you have just been violated.I DO have to say that the ending was unexpected, and the five minutes that made up the ending was decent.  It doesn't, however, make up for a horrible film.  What was Bruce Willis thinking when he read this script?  I mean, Willis isn't the best actor in Hollywood, but he should have at least had the brains to let someone else suffer through this (well, I mean someone BESIDES the people who saw it ... we suffered the most).I feel that I need to mention Haley Osment.  This child can act.  His character could not have been played any better by anyone else.  His performance stood out and he should be recognized for being a glimmer of light in such a terrible film.I implore you .... take the $5 and either rent a good film from BBuster or better yet, flush it down the toilet...because that's where it will go ANYWAY if you spend it on "The Sixth Sense".  Wait until it hits video and borrow it from a friend when HE rents it."Frightening"? "A Thriller"? "Edge-of-your-seat"?Not even close.If you are easily disappointed, stay away from this film.RATING:  1 out of 5


                
This movie was one of the worst I have seen this year.It was so boring I'm stunned why so many people like it & told me it was fantastic. Although the acting itself was very good, the best bits were in the preview. Ending was interesting but not enough to save it. I probably would have guessed it had I not been braindead from the boredom.


                
While "Sixth Sense" attempted to be a film by throwing the audience at last minute plot twist (using the same "this rearranges your reality" gimmick as "The Usual Suspects"), a Bruce Willis movie will never do more than entertain.  "Suspects," a unique and thoughtful movie, used this twist effectively, "Sixth Sense" came up short, if not at the box office, then in the minds of film lovers.


                
Porbably I had the advantage that I did not really follow movie chronicles lately, so I didn't know it was supposed to be a movie with a "twist".Therefore I enjoyed the ending... but only for about 10 minutes. Cause in spite of all the clues that are presented in the movie, lots of loose ends remain starting Cole not fearing Bruce Willis...Oscars? There's a chance for the kid.


                
I'm baffled by the popularity of this film -- it is excruciatingly slow, only halfway through it do we find out anything of interest (that the boy can see ghosts), the plot of the movie starts flat and stays flat throughout (the final twist at the end excepted, but that, in my mind, does not save the two hours of drudgery), and the characters seem uniformly one-dimensional. The little boy talks more like an adolescent that he could not be (his performance is good; it's the writing that's not believable), and throughout I felt instead of touched, emotionally manipulated (here's the music for you to feel moved, never mind that the dialogue and the situation is thoroughly cheesy). The story means well, but it feels like the screenwriter's bad first draft -- it needed substantial polishing. If you decide to see this film, know that you're in for a fake, manufactured experience without satisfactory plot development or resolution.


                
Unless you're impressed by Hollywood formula dim lighting, more formula music designed to let you know that something is about to happen, and a plot that makes you wonder if anything did happen, avoid this one.The only saving grace this film has is some excellent acting that attempts to prop up a story that is so trite that I almost asked for my admission price back.Come on, Bruce ... you can do better than this.


                
Perhaps careful editing, or a director who's work didn't so resemble a 30 second commercial..there are lots of things that might have made this movie worthy of an exceptional premise, unfortunately - it just ain't here.I like Bruce Willis - he can play drama, but here, he's given nothing to do but smirk meaningfully while the plot, drags on and on, getting to the point we all know it's going to get to. I actually appreciate movies that cut out all the standard, "coming to believe a fantastic tale", bit. You know the routine - character sees strange things..stranger finally tries to make other character believe strange things..plot creaks along until other character finally be;lives strange things exist. That might have played well the first hundred times it was used, but I'd just as soon get to the meat of the matter and move the damn plot along!Anyway, several scenes are so obviously staged that I found myself watching the extras in the scene, wondering what the assistant directors had told them to do..For instance, take the scene where Willis is late for dinner in the restaurant...The setting and filming looked so obviously staged that I couldn't pay attention to the leads.Or - a long shot of Willis and the kid walking up the street, just when an entire little-league team walks across the from of the shot..obvious and clumsy, slice of life touches that distract instead of feeling a natural part of the scene.But - great ending, serviced by the outline of a great plot that was poorly filled in and poorly directed.


                
it does not surprise me that most people like this movie so much.  it is often well-acted, has a well concealed plot twist, and many, albeit canned, touching and startling moments.unfortunately it just isn't very smart.one can imagine the writer(s) asking this question, "what if some people with apparent psychological maladies really have insight into another world?"  wouldn't that be nice.  unfortunately this is not the world i am familiar with.  in my world death and grief, the cruelty of human beings and the bonds of love, these things are mysterious.  it is not that my imagination of the variety of 'what ifs' is pedestrian.  it is that i have a wild imagination and am still wracked by uncertainty.this film glosses over the fundamental human theme of this uncertainty and instead assumes a fantasy world of magic and ghosts and purposefulness to every event.  by showing us the ghosts, not only are we assaulted with cheap special effects, but all uncertainty evaporates...the struggle of the boy and the psychiatrist are a foregone conclusion.  we are left with just the fantasy world.and it is not a rich fantasy world.  it is mundane.  it is commonplace for us to assume that our lives have meaning and that everything in them is somehow, given just the right perspective, understandable to us.  this film supports that common assumption.  that, i imagine, is why this run of the mill prostitute caked in obvious musical make-up is so attractive to many. it confirms their unquestioned biases.


                
This movie surely has its moments. Mainly during the first 30 Minutes. Then it fades into dumbness (why would dead people ask certain kids to do obscure things ??)... not even the strange twist at the end of the movie may save the whole thing from being more than a C-Picture Storyline. You could feel the twist coming right after 30 Minutes and that makes it booooring like hell. Two or three nice shocking effects are not enough to make a good suspense thriller out of nothing. Sorry, but there are way better supernatural thrillers on the shelve.


                
You couldn't have telegraphed the ending to the Sixth Sense more if you had used a cellphone.  I figured out the "twist" about ten minutes in, and after that it was just a matter of seeing how the characters reacted to it.Remember that just because a movie was mega-popular doesn't mean it is good...and this one definitely isn't.  A lotta flash and not much substance. And, I am sorry, but Halley Joel Osment is not the rebirth of Shirley Temple.  I don't see much talent differential between him and Macauley Culkin at this age.  Or Bruce Willis in this film, for that matter.


                
I am sorry, but I gotta say it, this film was not that great. Moreover, the big secret that you get let in on towards the end, is not that big of deal. I will admit, that some scenes are creepy, however the lack of any kind of supporting cast made this film rather average to me. However, the endless publicity that this film got has given it legendary status. However, I think many people have read a lot more in to this film, than was really there. Maybe it is my distaste for Bruce Willis and his other attempts at acting that are swaying me, but I don't think so. Note that I did not say this movie was bad, just not that good.


                
Whew, with the hype that went around this movie, you got the feeling that you miss out on elemental cinematic history if you don't see it. Unfortunately, that's not true. "The Sixth Sense" tries hard to be a good psycho-thriller and in fact the idea behind it was good. But as the script was written, someone must have had the idea to put the real big bang in there, something no viewer can guess to happen, the totally total of all story twists there ever were. But, bad luck, the grand idea has to fit into the rest of the script, so you have to modify it and make compromises. And really, I was disappointed with the end. Not because of it, but because everything else was set up for it. I didn't guess the twist because it was so sneaky, but because it was completely implausible. To clarify that I will try hard not to give anything away, in case you didn't see "Sixth Sense" yet, so I will ask only one question, which you'll understand later: how do you get into someones apartment without ringing the doorbell or knocking? There are numerous more points like that but by stating them I would give away the surprise. It's too bad the whole film had to suffer just to get that in.And then there are horror scenes, not too many, but I guess the writers figured that the movie had to give some more than the general idea and the last big bang. And again, they just serve the purpose and are badly integrated: young Cole, they boy who can see ghosts, later finds out that they want him to help them. I think even a ghost can anticipate that scaring someone to death isn't a good start for getting help.Probably the best asset of the movie is Haley Joel Osment, who played "Cole." Marvelous what this young boy could do with his role. Bruce Willis stays a little unbelievable as a psychologist, but that could be the script as well. So far I yet have to encounter a psychologist who handles therapy that way. Well, nice idea, nice movie, but nothing overly sensational. Horror movies greatly benefit from taking part in our world and incorporating the horror into it. But then they have to stay true to rules we all are familiar with and to those they need to set up to make us bite our nails. If "Sixth Sense" would have mastered both, I'd be yelling "great one!"


                
I usually enjoy Bruce Willis movies  as they are good entertainment,but this movie wasn't going anywhere. In fact it was a drawn out yawn.The acting talents were wasted on a story that really was tedious,in fact I think it was a greatly overrated movie.


                
First: I went to this film knowing very little about it (I deliberately avoided learning too much and having it spoiled) but--c'mon, guys!--I guessed the so-called surprise ending before the lights went down in the theatre! I questioned my guess once or twice but ten minutes in became sadly certain of where the whole movie was going, and then for two long dull hours endured one cheat-filled scene after another designed to keep the audience in the dark. The writer's maintenance of the 'surprise' left the script so full of holes that it looked like a lace curtain. I thought Osment and Willis did nothing special (except keep straight, sombre faces throughout) but I did love Toni Collette and thought she should not only have won an Oscar but a medal. I gave her an 8 and the film a -6 so that worked out to a 2. A *generous* 2!


                
****CONTAINS SPOILER****WARNING!****WARNING!***** Where to begin?  I'm not usually surprised at the bad taste of filmgoers, making such colossal hits out of Home Alone and The Lost World, however this film takes the cake.  I enjoyed the performances, particularly Toni Colette, Haley Joel Osment, and the vastly under-appreciated Bruce Willis.  However, as much as I admire some aspects of the film, the denouement is so predictable and frankly, insulting to any thinking adult, that the success of this film astounds me.  If the film had been like "The Crying Game" where the "surprise" twist is interesting, but more importantly,  a mere plot device to further the film in it's storyline, I might have had less problems with this movie.  I was shocked that anybody would have been fooled for a moment about the health of Bruce Willis' character.  If American audiences are dimwitted and unobservant not to notice the THOUSANDS of obvious hints that preceed the unveiling of the truth, then this is the film for them.  It was insulting to have to sit through the final minutes of the film, being forced to relive earlier scenes that any intelligent moviegoer should already have noticed.  The mere fact that Willis doesn't change his clothes ONCE should have tipped off everybody!Well, my comments certainly won't stop those people that make hits of such movies as this, but I must raise my voice in protest since the last year has seen such incredible  movies as Three Kings, Magnolia, Election, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Boys Don't Cry, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Topsy-Turvy, Eyes Wide Shut, The Straight Story, Sweet & Lowdown, All About My Mother, and underappreciated gems like The Limey and Go, and a half dozen more that will be remembered much longer than this slim piece of celluloid.
I just don't understand why people like M. Night Shyamalan's movies. This is his most acclaimed and simultaneously most typical movie: despite a decent performance from Osment, nothing actually happens. There is virtually no dialogue, and despite the claims of reviewers, little if any suspense. If you have enough time and money to rent this movie, it would be more entertaining to light the money on fire and try not to burn down your house. Seriously, just don't waste your time on anything by this director.


                
*spoiler warning* Without the performance of Osment, this blockbuster would've been lackluster...It's amazing to me that moviegoers loved the ending but considered the ending of "Jacob's Ladder" a cop-out.  Bruce Joel Rubin, a Buddhist, wrote the screenplay to "Jacob's Ladder" to portray the after-death bardo state, but was unable to get it produced, so he wrote a mass-market romantic-comedy version, which won him an Oscar for "Ghost." Perhaps a simplistic version is better than none ("What Dreams May Come"). For great bardo films, see "Mulholland Drive," "Waking Life" or "Dead Man." 4/10
I have been reading others' comments about this film and cannot believe they saw the same movie I did.  This is the worst movie I have seen in my entire life.  It has a plot that clatters and bumps along.  The characters are poorly developed.  Scenes are added for seemingly no reason and left unexplained.  Bruce Willis character apparently is a complete moron.  The utter lack of basic screenwriting ability of this film's author is astonishing.  This movie is not worth seeing at the cinema or renting on video.  If you do have the misfortune to see The Sixth Sense you will be wishing for the two hours of your life you wasted viewing it back.  As for the ending, it stinks too.  It is contrived and trite.


                
I would place this movie in the "nondescript" category. The acting was definitely very good, but I guess my blah reaction is caused by everybody else's reaction to "that cool ending." Come ON, people!!!! I knew nothing about this movie when I walked into the theatre (except that it was apparently a clever movie), and I was able to figure out the ending within the first half hour. It was that obvious. It seemed to me as if the screenwriters were having such a good chuckle knowing what the ending was going to be that they kept beating you over the head with little inside-joke clues. Frankly, I felt as if I were bleeding from being beaten over the head during the hospital scene and the jewelry store scene. If those two scenes had not been so incredibly overdone, then I would have been a lot more surprised at the end.
