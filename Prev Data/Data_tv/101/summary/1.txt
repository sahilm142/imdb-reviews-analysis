 This film is NOT A DOCUMENTARY!!

 Disturbing For All of the Wrong Reasons

 Steven Avery was convicted of cruelty to animals: he set a cat on fire

 Biased, misleading, dangerous unreality show

 Dishonest propaganda masquerading as an objective documentary

 Karma is a bitch

 Overstretched and way overrated

 Propaganda (and a boring TV show)

 It's about how two high paid lawyers twist an obvious case

 I must be the only one who thought this was incredibly boring

 Boooriiiinggg

 Watch only if you're interested in studying propaganda techniques

 A Travesty

 Very Misleading

 Don't beliebe any of the top review they're paid for

 Most biased documentary I ever seen!

 One sided biased

 Biased and Boring
