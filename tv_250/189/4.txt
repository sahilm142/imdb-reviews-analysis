Positive:
A few of the crimes and subsequent misleads and then problem solving were a bit unique and thoughtful. 
Negatives: 
1. Many of the crimes and misdirects are redundant, seen before, misleads w/final denouement quick and often anti-climatic. 
2. Dialogue is often artificially abrasive w/a lot of "put-on airs" self indulgence. 
3. Basic non-crime portion of the scripts are typical love life, social & personal dramas. Seen before!
4. Now for the worst: The detectives' first handling of crime scene items in bare hands and placing important evidence into a handkerchief or pocket has been a no-no since the late '20s in detective forensics at which point a murder kit of rubber gloves, plastic sterile evidence bags, etc. was first introduced.
