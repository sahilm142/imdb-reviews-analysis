 Heartfelt Drama of Post WWII Poverty a Must-See...

 Powerful and dramatic

 Disappointing

 A cinematic classic rich in human insight

 So simple and so intensely gripping. So simple and so masterfully done. Yet, a tidbit of something missing to get a score of 9 or 10

 Supremely downbeat

 A sad movie about the harshness of post-war Italy.

 An infantile movie.

 Simplistic perfection

 Good Movie but not the Greatest

 Small Needle, Big Haystack.

 A fight for a bike and a better life...

 WE are MEN... WE can do ANYTHING!!!

 It is an economically unstable time and an average family is barely scraping a living.

 Bicycle Thieves

 "A man who's robbed has a right to look".

 Despite its reputation, it's still not DeSica's best!

 A Classic of Italian Cinema

 Pass me a tissue....and some anti-depressants.

 The boy

 Let's be objective here...

 Bicycle Thieves taught me Italian culture

 "There's a cure for everything except death."

 When a Bike is not a Bike

 A hard weekend in town.
