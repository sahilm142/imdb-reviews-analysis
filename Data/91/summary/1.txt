 Insufferably Annoying

 A big fat dollop of saccharine Gallic fairy floss

 Obnoxious film about a woman-child who can't find a man.

 Why do people like this movie???

 Either one likes it or they don't

 It seems that I'm the only one...

 A celebration of passive aggression.

 only movie that made me feel sick

 The most overrated movie I've ever seen

 Title character wasn't compelling

 Too Strange

 Pure and utter horse radish.

 Soul-rapingly tedious

 Poor

 Are you kidding me?

 Horrible

 how easily pleased people have become

 Come on people

 Trys to be too much

 one of the most overrated movies ever!

 Not all it's cracked up to be.

 Made Hollywood look like a master.

 Boring, boring, boring!

 Uninteresting from the start!!!

 What a disaster of a film!
