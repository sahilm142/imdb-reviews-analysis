 Wes Anderson's Best?

 Funny, sweet, inventive and wonderfully acted

 "He retained the illusion with remarkable grace."

 Majestic as always

 You have to watch it

 Perfect mix of everything

 Tricks and Treats...

 A hotel well worth revisiting more than once

 Best effort by Wes Anderson since The Royal Tennenbaums

 Different, Exciting , Unpredictable , Masterpiece

 The Grand Budapest Hotel: Check in, and check it out.

 Very colorful, wonderful characters and a classy comedy.

 Strange, but utterly delightful

 A fun movie with a lot of Wes Anderson wit

 Intelligent Humor

 Great movie

 An Instant Classic

 Quirky, witty and a lot of fun!

 Our legacy lasts as long as someone remembers us

 Brilliant and funny

 A new high for Wes Anderson

 Glad I checked into The Grand Budapest

 A total surprise gem for me and possibly one of the most unique comedies I have ever seen

 Wonderful and witty

 Had a grand old time
