 Not a great series - No excuses

 25 years in the making and it was not worth the wait.

 No direction

 Bring on the dancing girls.....

 Re-watch the original series instead. Trust me

 Horrendous!

 Oh My God! This is really bad!

 Twin Peaks: Through the darkness of Future Past

 Worse show than you feared

 boring but nostalgic

 There has to be a mistake in the ratings!

 A Mixed Bag, But One Containing Mostly Junk

 I could do a better show and I didn't even shoot a video in my life.

 Surrealism for the sake of surrealism is not clever.

 Twin Peaks No More

 No Going HOme Again

 Use multi-verse gateways etc. make some sense rather then crazy evil dreams

 Can I get 18 hours of my life back?....

 Nothing in common with the original one

 I've only seen the first five new episodes...

 The reviews reviewed

 a total high art put on with moments of fantastic imagery

 This is embarrassing...
