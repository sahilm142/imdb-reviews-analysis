 a movie I shall undoubtedly come to understand and cherish more and more as I grow older

 Ikiru: Not the outstanding epic I expected

 Worthwhile film but somewhat disappointing to me

 "An emotional journey with Takashi Shimura"

 life, death and bureaucracy

 Beyond the Veil

 Today Is The Last Day Of The Rest Of Your Life.

 old Japanese film about a guy who's dying

 A good film that fails toward the end

 Something in life

 "Ikiru" or "To Live"

 Death change everything...
