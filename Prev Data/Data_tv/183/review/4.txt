Graham Linehan, a co-creator of the hilarious sitcom "Father Ted", has basically taken the "Father Jack" character from that show, made him younger, and put him in a bookstore in England. It doesn't really work. That behavior is funny for a supporting/side character, but in the lead character it quickly becomes tedious and monotonous. I rented this because of Tamsin Grieg and Bill Bailey and they are fine in their performances. The scripts have moments of really funny dialogue, but it's inconsistent. It's sort of half-assed creativity. The show is watchable, though, so if you don't have anything else better to view it helps pass twenty-two minutes.
