 Boring and cheesy

 More Captain America, than Pacifist war Hero

 Mel Gibson sure has a lot of family members on IMDb

 Utter waste of time

 MFT - Made For Teenagers

 A war film smothered between thick coatings of religious rhetoric....

 i know i cant trust IMDb rating whenever a movie is about American heroism

 Probably the worst war movie ever

 If you want a fantastic true story about war...

 Saving Private Ryan, NOT! Who is on first? Claude Rains

 Tries Too Hard

 Expected so much...over-hyped

 Decent flick, Great leads. Terrible choice of CGI

 Slow.

 In case you didn't know war is hell.

 Save your money

 ...not a bad movie but.........more science fiction than history

 What just happened there?
