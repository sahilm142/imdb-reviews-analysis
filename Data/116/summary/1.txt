 This movie ruined Batman for me

 heavily overrated

 What's Left When the Magic and Fun is Gone

 Very Boring, Not Fun, and WAY Over-rated....

 Dreadful Beyond Belief

 Batman Ends

 I'm sorry, but I hated it.

 Batman Begins To Smell

 Unbelievably Bad

 Heighth of Hollywood Catatonia

 A True Comic Fanboy Review

 Utter Waste of Time

 A movie (of sorts)

 Why would you think this film is good?

 The Worst Interpretation of Batman Ever

 Give it up tim burton

 Yuck

 Boring and formulaic at best

 Utter drivel

 Batman needs cold medicine

 Holy Hot Mess Batman!

 Holy Bat-Reruns!

 Total Suckfest
