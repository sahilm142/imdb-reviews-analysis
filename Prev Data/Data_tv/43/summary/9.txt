 Great Comedy Show

 Well Netflix ruined it....

 Like a Sitcom From God

 A Trainwreck Worth Watching

 One of the best and therefore often overlooked of recent American sitcoms

 An absolute FOX classic!

 Season Four is Definitely worth your time

 You just can't not love the Bluths

 One of the best comedies ever, canceled before its time

 Quite possibly the funniest show of all time!

 Try it; you might like it too

 One episode is all you need to be hooked

 Great

 Season four made a huge mistake.

 Awesome!

 Zany

 One of the best ever

 love the Fox run

 Common style, Unique Style

 Can't Wait for Season 4

 Sadly, "Police Squad!" has company

 Pretty Excellent

 Very good
