I think that Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back bis the worst movie I had ever watched although I have only watched it one time. I really do not like this movie for several reasons. First, the movie does not have a proper ending . It just stops when all the battles have finished and do not explain any other things after the battle. Instead, it only shows a shot of the characters looking out the window. This really disappoints me. Second, about the love between Princess Leia and Han Solo. I have never thought that Leia and Han Solo are a couple until they suddenly kiss. It makes me feel very surprised because the movie does not show any obvious relation between them. Third, the movie does not tell story but showing a battle sequence instead. It is very boring for audience to watch. Finally, the battle of Luke and Darth Vader did not bring out a mood of climax but instead it makes me think that "It is ridiculous."These are the reasons why I don't like this movie.
