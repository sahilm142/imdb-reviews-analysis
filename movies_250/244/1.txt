Under the pretense of "You can't judge a book by its cover" it teaches us that: - If you meat a jerk who treats you like dirt, he will surely turn out to be a great companion if you only look past his exterior. You can change him with love - don't worry.It's OK to be violent and kidnap people if you are a "beast" - that's very acceptable.There are only two type of guys to choose from: The beautiful jerk who stays a jerk (Gaston), and the ugly jerk who changes to prince charming (The Beast).Great message for kids.
Really, I don't understand what people find so romantic or compelling about this film.It is a hostage situation where the hostage has "fallen for" her captor. The Beast has captured Belle, holds her prisoner (in a gilded cage, perhaps, but it is still a cage), mistreats her, emotionally and verbally abuses her.Then she falls in love with him and begins to defend him.Stockholm Syndrome. This is a film that tries to turn a psychological maladjustment into romance.Pah!1 / 5 stars, only because of the music.


                
Can you say Stockholm syndrome? The beast Character is abusive, rude, borderline violent. The villain character is just as bad, but in a different way. Ridiculous plot, terrible story line, awful music. The music is so out of date its hard to belief this was a 1991 release. Belle was taken hostage and yet falls in love with the beast. Great message for parents with daughters out there. "Just go find yourself a abusive, violent ass who belittles you, he will change and treat you right, just hang in there" The underlying theme is very negative and I personally wouldn't let my kids watch this. All the later Pixar and dream works movies are light years ahead of this.
