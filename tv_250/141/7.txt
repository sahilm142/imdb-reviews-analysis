When I was a child in the 1960's my Grandparents use to take me to stay at the Marlborough Blenheim every summer in Alantic City. Back then the horse was still diving from the Steel Pier and the taffy was still being made in the window of shops along the Boardwalk. That was 40 years after this program is set, and yet it was still familiar to me as I watched the premier episode of this new HBO program. There is a fascinating history to the Boardwalk and it is about time that someone is telling it.*** Spoiler***The episode begins with the day before the first official day of Prohibition in the U.S. which would be January 15, 1920 ( prohibition began official Jan., 16, 1920) as fictional character Enoch "Nucky" Thompson is speaking to a temperance meeting about a fictional story of his childhood "Never let the truth get in the way of a good story" he later tells one of his men when he is questioned about the stories truthfulness. So here is the set up for the series "Never let the truth get in the way of a good story". It is said that the character is based upon Enoch Lewis "Nucky" Johnson an Alantic City Politician and racketeer of the period, but with great license (fictional license that is). The episode ends on May 11, 1920 as Big Jim Colosimo was gunned down in his eatery in Chicago while waiting for a shipment to arrive, supposedly by Al Capone; but who knows. So the time-line of the episode is Jan 15-May 20, 1920.One scene has Nucky standing on the Boardwalk, near a bench, looking out over the Alantic Ocean and I had to laugh since it is similar to where Tony Soprano would stand both in dream sequences and other scenes of the show. It is inevitable the comparisons, New Jersey, Mobsters. One has to compare also to the Godfather at the end as one man is taken out and dumped in the ocean (ala Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero in the Sopranos-although this body turns up), and Big Jim is gunned down in Chicago. I like it when business is taken care of at the end of the show.***Spoiler Ends***It's a mob show ant the first episode is directed by Martin Scorsese, and his ability to move this genre forward are legendary, can his ability be met in future episodes we will see. I cannot imagine that it will be as popular as The Sopranos was, but ya never know...
We have been told to brace ourselves for a certified television masterpiece, to be mentioned in the same breath as The Sopranos and The Wire. I admire the PR work behind this one, but having already seen the entire season, I am more than reserved about the hyperbolic praise pouring on Boardwalk Empire.Of course, there is much to admire in Boardwalk Empire in terms of production values and savoir-faire: from the lavish set (the whole Atlantic City boardwalk was recreated, brick by brick) to the jaw- dropping costumes, from the slick panning-shots to the assured editing, probably never before has TV looked like big-budget cinema. Every single doorknob, period prop or jacket button look expensive; millions have not been spared, and it shows. Atlantic City is a ghost-town full of dead-men walking, and despite all that illegal champagne flowing and decadent partying, it feels like the mob hedonism, Goodfellas style, is long gone. Huge credits must also be given to the supporting cast: Michael Pitt, presumably filling in for the Di Caprio obligatory slot (it seems that Scorsese is now unable to produce anything without him, or anybody that looks like him), is by far the most fascinating actor to watch, dominating every scene he is in with a textbook interiorised intensity à la DeNiro; Stephen Graham is a great proto-Al Capone with his pudgy bulldog face; Michael Stuhlbarg pulls out an impressive metamorphosis from the nerdy Jewish academic he played in A Serious Man to the suave yet constantly menacing criminal mastermind Arnold Rothstein ; the disfigured WW1 veteran with his mask and sniper rifle is genius but underused, and finally Michael K. Williams (a.k.a Omar from The Wire), providing a nice touch of self-referential casting (look at how much he enjoys himself declaiming countless "motherfuckers" after all these years of swearing deprivation). Kelly Macdonald inherits the most likable character with the poor Irish immigrant turned courtesan Margaret Schroeder, but she turns out incredibly irksome halfway through the season– mainly because of the stagnant nature of her story lines and the total lack of chemistry with co-star Steve Buscemi. Which leads me to the two antagonistic forces supposedly driving the show: Buscemi's Nucky Thompson, half-gangster half-politician, and Michael Shannon's Agent Van Alden, a quarter Elliot Ness, a quarter puritan and a good half pure sociopath.This is where one of Boardwalk Empire's main flaws lie: in the miscasting of their two leading men, Steve Buscemi and Michael Shannon. I am not the first one to notice it; as good as Buscemi can be playing the off-kilter supporting role in independent flicks, he does not convince as the main focus of the show. He lacks Gandolfini's stature, DeNiro's charisma, Pacino's menace or Idris Elba's charm – to cite only but a few iconic on screen kingpins. Buscemi is at his best schmoozing during political reunions with his witty one-liners and wry smile, but fails to deliver any thrills when things are heating up. On the other side of the spectrum, Shannon delivers a madly theatrical, completely OTT performance, as the grimacing, self-flagellating federal agent. He never really fits in the show, and personally, I never managed to take him seriously<U+0085>Finally, my main concern with this first season is the plot: it's all over the place, consisting of a disjointed bunch of not-so-exciting story lines; the series slightly taking off after five episodes, but never to really climax at any point and ending up with one of the most underwhelming finale I have ever seen. The attempts to introduce a solid socio-historical background are laboured and slow down the action, and in the end are too sporadic to really fulfil their pedagogic intentions.Most of the events taking place in Atlantic City are dull, and the show only seems to achieve its potential when introducing historical characters like Capone, Rothstein, Lucky Luciano etc. or taking its protagonists to New York and Chicago – wherever Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt) goes basically. The best episode of season 1 is by far "The Face and the Finger", a violent account of the territorial war in Chicago's Greek Town experienced through Jimmy's reluctant involvement. Nothing to do with Nucky Thompson then<U+0085> Less of him and more of Michael Pitt's Darmody in season two would be a big improvement.Like most of Scorsese's films of the last 15 years, Boardwalk Empire reaches perfection on a purely technical level, but it feels more like a trip to the museum than a movie – where are the urgency, the guts, the invention that made Marty's earlier stuff so indispensable? It also feels like the weight of expectations is burdening Terence Winter, nowhere near as creative and groundbreaking as he was when penning cult Sopranos episodes.Maybe it was just a hesitant start to a classic in the making, and Boardwalk Empire, just like The Wire, may turn out to be a slow-burner. Or not.ggendron.wordpress.com


                
This may be premature as a critique. Only two episodes have been shown thus far. But the premise of the story and its relation to actual characters and events in American history require attention. The topic of prohibition and the evil effect it had on American life in the 20th century is already legend. Without it, other melodramas like The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Sopranos never would have been filmed, nor would organized crime as we know it have been possible. Boardwalk Empire is therefore in one sense an historical documentary in that its setting is 1920, at the very beginning of one of the most colossal political mistakes of all time. I am therefore happy to commend the producers on that count. I also appreciate the effort put forth in creating a more or less accurate filmed portrayal of life in 1920. Despite some minor anachronisms, popular culture and styles of the period are spot on.What I dislike has to do with extremely s-l-o-w pacing and endless repetition of obvious visual and scripted elements -- especially in scenes involving two characters jawboning with each other. Sentiment likewise intrudes in the form of forced cuteness having nothing to do with drama and everything to do with overemphasizing how different life was from the present day. Lots of sentimental Capra and Scorsese stuff, one may say. The character of Nucky never quite gets away from emphasizing his essential softness at the expense of his nastiness, vastly unlike Brando's Godfather or Gandolfini's Tony Soprano. Speaking of jawboning, catch the final scene of the first episode in which Nucky and Jimmy are face to face. The camera catches Jimmy from behind chewing his endless wad of gum while the other camera behind Nucky shows nothing of the sort in Jimmy's expression.That constant gum-chewing by actor Pitt has to be the most annoying and distracting shtick thus far in the series.Update at end of second season: Well, my assessment was premature. Whatever was lighthearted at the beginning became darker and darker as the series developed. A certain Gothic element intruded upon what was in its historical context a docudrama of sorts, culminating in as many horrific ways as the imagination could conjure. The chief problem was that catharsis requires an evolution of character as in classic tragedy, and I could not follow any logical development to that end. All that remains is a bad taste in the mouth.


                
When I started the series I wasn't so excited because it was a little boring and had a lot of names I had to recall.But as I continued watching it it was becoming better(especially after episode 5).After that episode it was great watching it.Season 2 was thrilling since Jimmy vs Nucky was something we all liked to see.And as the series was on its peak suddenly at season's 2 finale comes the death of Jimmy.50% of the series was destroyed in 1 shot.However, I continued watching it but 3 episodes later I realized that after Jimmys death all action was gone.To sum up, if you think you are able not to sympathize with Jimmy you can watch that one.On season 3 some good characters also appear like Jeep(sorry for spelling if its wrong) who are far from boring and bad-ass. As far as the costumes are concerned they are very good and they depict 1920s.There is also a very nice approach to this period as every little detail is included in the show.It is very hard to find mistakes or not well explained scenes.Anyway, I think that killing Jimmy took away Boadwalk's Empire chance of becoming my favorite show.
Steve Buscemi in another light. He does a phenomenal job and the direction in this series is completely on-point! Not to mention the musical score and cinematography...did I mention wardrobe?! So so good. Check it out.


                
I'm no critique writer professional, I just wanna say that I thought the program was unmissable- until some point in the 4th series, and the 5th was horrifically dull and boring. I thought showing Nucky's upbringing was completely pointless and was just a space filler cuz they ran out of ideas. Atho they actors they found to play the younger versions of certain characters were amazingly similar. I also thought Luciano was made out to be a total pussy throughout most of it, when he was, as legend recalls, a hardnut who would face up to anyone.Have to make it ten lines which is a bit of a joke really, I've said all I wanna say, this is more of a complaint than a review tbh. EXTREMELY disappointing end.


                
The cinematography of this movie is nothing short of amazing and deserves every award that was thrown at it. It does nothing short of bringing the bootleg gangster era back to life. The plot starts out tight and vibrating, but already in season two it begins to loose focus. It was like "wow, we've had two great seasons with this character, now what should we have him do?". And the finale was just disappointing. Nothing in it to make me angry like with Dexter, it just felt flat and meh. And it felt like it pretended to have led up to though all five seasons, rather than actually having planned it along, although I must say they did a very good job of that pretending. The strength of this show is that it understands that - in the words of Chuck Wendig - plot is made of people. What drives the story is people who want things and other people who want different things and some times they work together and other times they work against each other. And they try to be all cool and businesslike, but they also love and hate or maybe they just want revenge for some imagines slight. And sometimes coincidences happen, but only because they also happen in real life and it would be weird to have a whole show without them. In season three when the creators start looking for things to throw at Nucky to have him fight for his life and his position, they still throw people at him, characters with wants and needs and plans to get those fulfilled. New players who are fascinating to watch, even as it becomes slightly dull to watch Nucky himself always come out on top. To bad that so many of them in the end get treated like loose ends to be tied.


                
This show maintained an even keel throughout its five season duration. Yes, there were some monumental events, but there was nothing that really left my jaw agape with the thought bubble above my head saying, "I never saw that coming." The show mainly predicates upon Enoch "Nucky" Thompson (Steve Buscemi) who is an unlikely gangster. He is not a pure gangster, rather he is a politician turned gangster. The Steve Buscemi look and manner of speaking defy your cliché gangster but you can see that that's the point. Now, I have to say this... Buscemi is not a good actor. I don't say that because he's not pleasing to look at, but really he has no range and he almost always sounds scripted. He's excellent at supporting roles as he's played the entirety of his career. The show worked in spite of Buscemi not because of him.As for the characters, there were plenty of them. I found myself disliking most of them and others I would go back and forth. Nucky was one such character that I would like at times and root for him to be the victor and at other times I rooted for his destruction. There were only three characters I genuinely liked: Arthur Rothstein, Meyer Lansky, and Billie Kent. The first two because they were very keen and business-like in all situations. They never showed too much of themselves. The third, Billie Kent, played by Meg Chambers Steedle, was very charming and so opposite the type of woman you'd expect to be seeing an older rich criminal. She didn't want his money or his favors, she was just living her life and he was a part of it.As for the storyline, it was a gangster tale taking place in the prohibition era of the roaring 20's. As with all gangster tales, many people die, bosses rise and fall, it's all in how you tell it. This one was told well. It wasn't to die for, it was simply good.


                
It's refreshing to see shows with this type of period setting. Seems no one cares about these old days and what kind of entertainment a storyline from back then could offer. Somehow, the producers got an idea that this storyline could work...well....it worked....for the most part.Whats' great about this show is how many plot angles they throw in to keep you interested. From President harding's extra marital affair to Al Capone and various others. That being said, there are a few plot lines in this show that for me...just don't work.To start off with, the angle about the bisexually confused wife slash artist who cheats on her boyfriend whom she has a child with. She continually makes naive decisions about running off with her "lover". The angle they play off is that at that time it was..."Bohemian". For me, when I see this I see a storyline trying to fit in the "Great Gatsby" type of Jazz Age story into it. You know how Paris at this time was a sort of "free" type of society but the problem with this angle is that this wasn't in Paris...it's Atlantic City. To me it was an obvious attempt by the screenwriters to just try to add some juice to keep it interesting. For me it just doesn't belong in this story.Second is the storyline of the overtly religious Prohibition agent who throughout the series seems to be some kind of "preacher" type trying to do right. They show eventually that he's a bit off kilter and not without sin but what his actions do in the latter half of the first season are a bit on the "yeah right" side. They really over due this angle to the point I didn't even pay attention to it. I just waited for the next scenes.By far this is a solid show. I would easily recommend this show simply because they don't make enough shows about the old days. Everything seems to be around modern times. Stuff we've seen a million times already. Going back in time doesn't mean boring...with this show it means...interesting.
