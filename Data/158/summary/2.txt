 The Genius of Buster Keaton

 Understated Perfection

 The Greatest War Comedy ?

 Loco and Motive

 "If you lose this war, don't blame me".

 Richly inventive comedy with a logically impeccable plot that makes the hyperbolic slapstick seem plausible and inevitable; this is a work of art and a work of genius

 It is more appreciated now than when it was released

 Wonderful Humor, Action, & Melodrama

 An instant favorite

 The Greatest Comedy Ever Made

 Keaton is amazing

 Silent era comedy classic

 Long live Buster Keaton, one of the great actor of all time

 Me And Mordaunt Vs. The World

 Very entertaining film

 The General (1926)

 The General

 Great physical comedy

 Keaton is lovable and talented

 Great comedy from the twilight of the 'silents'

 Quite an achievement of film making

 Incredibly impressive visuals but totally lacking in story

 Keaton shows why he was king of comedy stunts

 My Second Favorite Buster Keaton Film
