 Excruciating Slow Or Fascinating: Your Choice

 The best opening sequence

 A Good Story, Well Written and Directed

 The Good, the Bad and the Slow as Molasses

 Leone falls in love with his style a little too much toward the end but this is still a cracking film, albeit it has gained a status I'm not entirely sure it deserves.

 Once Upon a time in the West

 sexist!!!!

 A big fistful of Paramount's dollars.

 Classic, but has some flaws

 Wonderful acting and flashy camrerawork make this picture...

 most overrated film on list

 a good movie to watch , but doesn't deserve " Top Rated Movies #36 " !!

 Great movie. But not what I expected.

 "Once Upon A Time" is to the western as what "2001" is to sci-fi

 Almost great but for the miscasting

 One upon a Time in the West

 Not Leone's Best but Certainly an Aesthetically Precious Movie

 Something To Do With Death

 a little disjointed for me
