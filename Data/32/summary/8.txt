 A lost opportunity

 Thought-provoking adventure,

 Good but a bit long

 Depressing but Visually Stunning.

 Keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better, and BETTER!

 Maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best

 Not Nolan on his A Game

 A visual treat for Sci-Fi fans

 Soap

 "We're not meant to save the world, we're meant to leave it."

 Why tack on an ending where everything works out perfectly?!

 One of Nolan's best, but watch out Chris.

 Although amazing, not as amazing as people make it out to be.

 Smart, interesting, engrossing

 Subpar compared to Inception & gravity

 Interstellar : More than a director, it is made by a DREAMER

 Very nearly out-of-this-world

 Great Movie, but a little over-hyped

 Interstellar is 10 times beyond Inception but not that perfectly executed

 Great movie.

 Original and thrilling, but a bit overlong

 Stellar at certain parts

 Good but not great

 Great movie

 I Have No More Nails Anymore.
