 An intelligent and neutral look into modern science

 Through the Wormhole

 Quantum Mechanics like you've never seen it

 "...best ideas from the very edges of science"

 Brilliant.

 Best show in a LONGGG TIME!!

 Brilliantly Constructed Malicious Disinformation

 used to be a ten, quickly degenerated to zero: result is FIVE

 Pseudoscience mixed with religious nonsense

 Used to be a good science show. Now i don't know what it is.

 Utterly disappointed!

 Noble attempt, but hit-and-miss. Too many voices.

 Why bring religion into a science show?

 Very poor - visually OK but intellectually dishonest and weak

 Good attempt at discussing science, but badly flawed

 Where Practical and Theoretical Science Meet

 Absolutely inane

 Brilliant !

 Morgan frees your imagination.

 Don't stretch (into seasons) & compromise on quality.
