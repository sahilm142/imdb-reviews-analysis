 A hauntingly flawed unconventional masterpiece

 "Well this is just a deal gone wrong, isn't it?"

 A very different film

 You have to pay attention.... it helps.

 One scene wrecked the whole movie for everyone

 No Country for Old Men (2007)

 Gritty edge-of-seat from start to finish

 Bardem's Country.

 Such great compelling characters

 Impressive but lacking in some small details

 A chilling, memorable piece of cinema

 Slow paced crime/thriller but highly amusing and engaging

 Javier Bardem Steals The Show,

 My review

 Brilliant violence

 "You can't make this stuff up, I dare you to try"

 Another masterpiece by the Coen brothers.

 When Chigurh is around......There Will Be Blood

 not too bad

 And There Are No Clean Getaways

 No Country for The Big Lebowski

 Reflecting current trends in America's consciousness

 MY REVIEW: Flawed Perfect Western Thriller!!

 What's the most money you ever lost on a coin toss?

 An Impressive Modern Western
