This is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will have you know that Real Men don't watch anything by Truffaut. It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything to -say- here. The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Sica's "Bicycle Thief"? Or anything by Hitchcock?So all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as Truffaut, who spends all his free time 'screwing up his eyes' at the movies, who wrecks schoolroom discipline, gets accused of plagiarism(the many petty thefts), and ultimately escapes societal confines to make 'his own movie'. Sorry...been there, done that too many times for this to matter.


                
I know, I know...everybody's a critic. But if everyone else can add their 2 cents, here's my three...I find it ridiculous that we hold these movies as such classics, that aren't really as brilliant as we claim. Don't get me wrong, I actually loved the movie as a story, it was a real slice of life and as I writer...to keep an audience tuned in for the entire movie without actually having a "story" other than a kid being a hard head...you have done your job well as a film maker...but I give it a 2 because it is held at such high regard, then you go and see it and it's just another movie that could easily be forgotten about in a couple of years, if people didn't boast about how great it was. I think we need to reconsider "What a classic really is." And stop falling in with the crowd because it's enjoyed by the masses and a good print is still available to be restored. Thank You
