These lines of dialogue are a good summary of why Rebecca sucks.I'm not beautiful, or intelligent. - But you have other, better qualities. Like kindness and sincerity. - So let me ask you, what was Rebecca like? What did people see in her? - Why, she was the most beautiful creature I've ever seen.Either this is the worst writing ever, the worst character development ever, or a really pathetic attempt to be mysterious and complex, making it again the worst writing ever. Hitchcock is so blindly driven by his technicality that he actually forgets to read the screenplays he's turning into films. And if that's not the case, if he wasn't hearing impaired on set, he has the intelligence of an infant and the creative energy of a euthanised walrus. On top of this hysterical delinquency, I can't believe women's rights groups haven't tried to bury Hitchcock under the insurmountable pile of celluloid he cost the world. Every female character in his films is either retardedly stupid, socially inept, cruel and backstabbing or insane. I can almost see sometimes the bruises on these actresses faces from the beatings he must give them in their trailers each night.


                
This is another example of Hitchcock's hatred for women. Great Movie...last century. Who likes to see a woman act and be treated like a stupid child nowadays? If you like watch people suffering for no reason but their own fault this is your movie. Or else watch "Big Brother" or similar crap.
