 Unoriginal and seemingly scripted by a teenage boy, lol

 How is this so highly rated?

 Get woke, go broke, Netflix

 Pretty aweful, but the animation is ok.

 All style, no substance

 18 triple-A video game trailers in a row.

 Boring Pseudo-Deep stories

 Such a wasted chance...

 Wasted opportunity
