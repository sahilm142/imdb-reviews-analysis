 I wanted to like this movie but just couldn't.

 I wish I had a spotless mind.

 I can't understand how someone can like this movie.

 It must be a generational thing

 Like giving cotton candy to a starving person

 Pseudo-intellectual claptrap of the Charlie Kaufman Kind

 TERRIBLE! The most OVER-RATED movie I have ever seen!

 Absolute pretentious rubbish

 Impossibly Crappy- Few Redeeming Qualities

 Pretentious pseudo-intellectual drivel

 WHY it is the worst movie ever.

 A Beginning That Never Seems To End Followed By An Ending That Never Seems To Begin

 Big waste of 2 hours of my life

 Way too strange.

 Absolutely worthless garbage!

 Why does everyone Like this Rubbish

 Eternally terrible

 Oh Dear!

 Pure tripe

 Unclear

 Migraine-inducing, nasty trash

 Don't waste your money

 I wish I could erase this movie from my mind

 This stinks

 Garbage!
