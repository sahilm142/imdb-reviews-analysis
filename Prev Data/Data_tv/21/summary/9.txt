 Don't mistake this for sci-fi à la Star Trek/Star Wars - It has more in common with Grey's Anatomy

 An original vision of the future

 What a pity - and it's a real shiny show, too!

 Awesome writing, great acting, beautifully shot

 One of the best Sci-fi-Western shows EVER. So good it's criminal.

 American answer to Blake's 7 - but better.

 Amazing

 Joining the ranks

 Sublime series that should be resurrected!

 Why the hell did this show get cut

 Cut short just in time

 Forgettable, yes, but there are degrees of forgettability!

 Realistic Sci-fi

 A great show that got knocked out too quickly.

 Great Series. It's too bad it didn't catch on.
