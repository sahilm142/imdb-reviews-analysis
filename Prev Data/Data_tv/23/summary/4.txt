 season 3, yet one more flop

 Total sleeper.

 Wow - what a disappointing finale

 WHAT THE HECK ARE THEY SAYING???

 Show became unwatchable

 Amatueirsh plot elevated by brilliant acting by the two leads.

 Unintelligible

 S1 awesome, S2 unnecessarily complicated, S3 tedious

 Declining..

 Poorly structured storyline

 Meandering on the Bayou

 Stop at season 1

 A masterpiece.

 Much ado about almost nothing

 OMG this is a waste of time!

 Matthew McConaughey, Terrible, Phony, Plastic

 Slow slow

 Extremely boring and long, suffocating, but still its good in a way. Its a good story, but to long
