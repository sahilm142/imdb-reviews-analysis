 It's not the story; it's the telling

 Excellent Start

 Oh my God.

 Engrossing and Talented Beginning to a Mystery

 Visually stunning camera-work and art direction

 Defenitely one of the most exciting show in its genre

 In the details

 A Realistic Take on the Classic 'Who-Done-It' Plot

 shades of gray

 Like reading a good book. Realistic show.

 "In the Night of" a series of tragic events befall the antagonist, Nad, impacting his family and changing Naz' identity.

 Slow paced suspense, highly engaging

 That kind of special beauty

 The Night Of is Superbly Written and the Acting is Pitch Perfect. It Also Boasts one of the Best Finishes for a TV Show I've Ever Seen

 Tense, dark and gritty
