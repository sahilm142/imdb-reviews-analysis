It's a good movie but with loads of gore and guts . It's a typical Tarantino film , several murders , fights and plot twists . The film mingles martial arts , Hong Kong movies , Spaghetti Western , action movies with Japanese Manga or anime .Uma Thurman is wonderful and overblown . Uma came up with the film's opening shot of her beaten up and wearing a wedding gown . Her struggle with the enemies is incredible , the training with the master ¨Xian Ping¨ has been extraordinary , likeness to Matrix . Although numerous scenes were done by Zoë Bell , Uma Thurman's stunt double , as the shot where the Bride splits a baseball in two with a samurai sword was done for real on the set . Luci Liu is also unbelievable , her performance is breathtaking , as well as the fighting against Uma Thurman . Support cast is frankly well , such as : Vivica A. Fox , Daryl Hannah , Julie Dreyfus , Michael Madsen , Kuriyama , Michael Parks , James Parks , Michael Bowen and Sonny Chiba as the old master . David Carradine makes an invisible intervention , his acting stays for the second part .Interesting and stirring screenplay , according to Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman the idea for doing "Kill Bill" began during the filming of Pulp Fiction (1994) , the two began talking about the kinds of movies that they would like to do and Quentin said he would like to do a 70's style kung-fu flick . Thrilling and moving musical score by RZA. Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Robert Richardson . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Quentin Tarantino . Rating : Above average.


                
Kill Bill is not only a martial arts film, but also one where the violence is depicted in a stylish and bloody way. As a whole, the film was shot in an artistic way with great acting and artistic dialogs. Colors are simply gorgeous and the music is unbelievably profound.However, the pace of the film is incredibly slow. I'm not saying it lacks fight scenes. What it lacks is the story, so there's nothing to fill in the blank between action sequences. Sometimes ridiculously long shots occur with no obvious reason. What's also worth mentioning is, the last fight scene in the film is also slow as hell. Two women fight with sword and it's about ten to eleven hacks, while the fight scene lasts for several minutes due to some weird long shots where the two actresses stand still there doing nothing...As a whole, the film is a piece of art, but don't go looking for deep plot or thrilling pace. And I don't intend to recommend it to any Chinese or Asian audience who are very familiar with martial arts films since it's really slow and lacks story compared to others in the same genre.7/10.


                
this was LAME.  pointless (and typically graphic) violence (though somewhat comic), none of the interesting plot turns of reservoir dogs & pulp fiction, just straight-ahead action boringness.  and normally i am all down for violent action movie stuff.i think quentin fell in love with the samurai genre (assuming there's room in his heart for another besides himself) and is doing some kind of homage, and it's just weak.  i have to say i'm not planning to see vol ii.  so sad.


                
Kill Bill: Volume One (2003) was the first part of a three and a half hour film. Instead of putting out a three and a half hour grind house picture, the directed split it in half and got two movies out of the production. Quentin Tarentino knew better than to try and direct the action scenes himself so he hired Yuen Woo-Ping to direct the action. When you combine The Bride Wore Black, From Bombay to Nagoya and Lady Snow Blood you get one of the most interesting films of 2003.The movie is about a woman simply known as the Bride (Uma Thurman). She was a member of an elite team of assassins known as the DiVAS (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox). All of it's members had code names of poisonous snakes. Well, she wanted to leave but it ain't so easy to leave the business. After being in a coma for nearly five years, The Bride plots her revenge to get the rest of the Vipers and their ring leader Bill (David Carradine). The road to revenge is filled with a lot of obstacles. Can The Bride achieve her goals and eliminate the DiVAs or will they be able to stop her dead in her tracks?I didn't like the American release but I saw the movie again on a Japanese import D.V.D. and I was quite impressed by the uncut version. If I were to review the American Theatrical version I wouldn't have been too kind. Followed by a very disappointing sequel.Highly Recommended (Japanese Version).


                
A juggernaut of technical wizardry, this Quentin Tarantino film (product?) is winking and nodding but not especially human. A die-hard of the neo-Western (where Japanese samurai flicks meet the new-fangled Old West) and TV action thrillers, Tarantino is the master of quick, canny scenes of carnage. It gets awfully bloody, but not in the NC-17 way. No, Tarantino is much too cute, and his imitativeness isn't exploitative or schlocky (as much as he might like it to be). He gives showy roles to many fine actors, and Uma Thurman seems to inspire him to new heights. But he also gets easily sidetracked and becomes self-enamored of scenes that don't play, plod along or get too cheeky (as with the opening bit featuring Vivaca A. Fox, which is good but not quite as solid as the rest of the film). "Vol. 2" is more story-heavy, and gives the actors better room to emote, but also features lots of outlandishness, sometimes just for the sake of a cheap, quick laugh. The trickery, comic mayhem, wild ambushes and female ass-kicking don't amount to much in retrospect. Both volumes include some lovely moments, successfully lowball comedy, and they refuse to let up, but do they honestly turn the audience on? I felt exhausted instead of keyed-up. "Vol. 1" **1/2 from **** ... "Vol. 2" *** from ****


                
Whereas Reservoir Dogs (1991) and Pulp Fiction (1994) took elements from the French New Wave and American independent cinema of the 1970's to create bold, iconic, character driven films rife with clever dialog, uncompromising violence and subtle allusions to a myriad of varied, textured film references, Kill Bill: Volumes 1 & 2 (2003-2004) take the idea of referencing even further, giving us blatant and literal references that cross from one genre to the next with a complete disregard for whether or not the audience is familiar with the kind of work being quoted. This technique is pushed even further in the subsequent Death Proof (2007), which really does require an audience to be familiar with its subject in order to get the most out of the style, set-up and intent. Here, all pretensions to the cinema of the French New Wave are dropped, as well as the more adult-orientated flavour of the previous Jackie Brown (1997), which was perhaps more in keeping with the aging spirit of the blacksploitation sub-genre of films from which it drew a superficial influence.Instead, Kill Bill (2003) finds director Quentin Tarantino shifting his focus to Asian cinema and referencing sources as disparate as Kung-Fu (1972), Lone Wolf and Cub (1972), Lady Snowblood (1973), The Street Fighter (1974), Shogun Assassin (1980) and Ichi the Killer (2001), as well as taking direct influence from the Shaw Brothers studio productions of the 1960's and filmmakers like Kinji Fukasaku and Seijun Suzuki. Alongside these visual and thematic reference points we also have a continual reliance on juxtaposing ideas and iconography taken from spaghetti westerns, blacksploitation pictures, Chinese "wuxia" and kung fu movies, Japanese Manga and Anime, hip-hop, American exploitation and revenge cinema, and François Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black (1968). These influences are all combined, sometimes obviously and sometimes with more subtlety, but all used with flair, imagination and intelligence to create the right kind of cinematic environment for this purposely elaborate, over-the-top, comic-book-style tale of roaring rampage and revenge to play out against.The opening shot is fantastic; rife with cinematic allusions to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Seijun Suzuki's Tokyo Drifter (1965), with the use of black and white cinematography and the image of the iconic "Bride" laid out on her back, bloody and bruised, pleading for her life with an off-screen Bill who is about to put a bullet in her head. From here we cut to the title and the near-iconic use of Nancy Sinatra's version of the Sony Bono track 'Bang, Bang', which is every bit as bold, amusing, cool and ironic as the use of opening music in other Tarantino works. From here we cut back and forth in a non-linear progression to track the return and subsequent revenge of "The Bride" against the gang of devious former comrades who betrayed her.As the film is split into two halves (for commercial reasons, as opposed to artistic; but regardless, tying in with the literary use of voice-over, chapter-heading, an unreliable narrator, etc) there will always be the question of how to critique it. Do we view them as two separate films that should each deliver on the characteristics that we think cinema should pertain to, or do we view this as one long film; a continuation of a single character and theme over the course of two very different though ultimately linked feature films? If we take the former approach, then Volume 1 (2003) is the easiest film to appreciate on an immediate level, concerning itself more with scenes of balletic, visually rich and heavily choreographed action; relegating much of Tarantino's usual interplay of character and dialog to the background and allowing the visuals to completely envelope us. In this sense Tarantino is drawing on the B-cinema pop-art explosion of Suzuki, most notable in the sequence where "The Bride" takes on the Crazy-88's amidst a barrage ostentatious camera movements, lighting changes, black and white inter-cutting and bouncing Go-Go music from the 5, 6, 7, 8's.There are also elements of over the top martial arts choreography juxtaposed against scenes of more brutal, harder-hitting violence, obvious miniature work that almost points to the original Godzilla films, retro use of rear-screen projection, allusions to films as disparate as Twisted Nerve (1968), Hitchcock, Brian De Palma's elaborate use of split-screen, the production design from Gate of Flesh (1964) and Sex and Fury (1974), the casting of Chiaki Kuriyama (perhaps familiar to most audience from her appearances in Fukasaku's Battle Royale) and Bruce Lee's Game of Death (1978). Though these elements are impressive, particularly when coupled with the scenes of over-the-top violence (which nods to the exaggerated bloodshed of Anime and of films like the aforementioned Shogun Assassin and Ichi the Killer) and the technical virtuosity of Tarantino and cinematographer Robert Richardson, the effect can seem hollow; especially when we cross-reference this to the much more reserved, dialog-driven Volume 2 (2004).With this in mind, it would seem more appropriate to view the films as one single film; taking into account both the bursts of colour and energy presented in Volume 1 and the slower, more character-driven approach of Volume 2 to really get the most out of the incredible journey that this larger than life character undertakes. It also allows us to better appreciate the extraordinary performance from Uma Thurman in the central role, who here gives one of the best performances of her career; instilling "The Bride" with a sense of honour and purpose that makes her violence and bloodshed all the more understandable. Kill Bill: Volume 1 doesn't quite scale the dizzying heights of Tarantino's first three films; lacking the intuitive style, unique dialog and intricate plotting - but it does represent a new phase of his career; one that pushes cinematic reference even further to create a visual tapestry of self-aware cinema that appeals to learned cineastes preoccupied with technique, as well as offering a bold story, memorable characters and a great sense of entertainment.


                
I had heard mixer reviews about the Kill Bills, but part one was a blast! Truly awsome action film. It manages to introduce an interesting story, characters and action very quickly, making it intriguing. Aa the film roles on it keeps feeding the audience snipits of information, driving the main characters story, Making the audience root for her and understand her motives, despite her being a merciless killer.Also, that Fight scene at the end...wow. AMAZING!!! Stunning directing. Very enjoyable, and a great Tarentiono movie. It's just ashame, I didn't find Kill Bill Vol.2 as good.


                
Comas are a deep sleep wherein a victim is neither living nor dead. The mantle of darkness protect the soul from the reality which put it there. However, an ancient proverb states, that "if the spirit has unfinished business in the world of the living, then woe betide those who put it there." Such is the premise of Kill Bill. Once part of an elite group of world wide assassins, 'B.B', the victim, {Uma Thurman} awakens and recalls well who tried to kill her. Throughout the rest of the film, viewers are introduced to her former friends all code named after the world's most venomous snakes. Not sure of the reason why she was nearly murdered, " Black Manba" as B.B. was code named, (The deadliest snake) goes after each of the assassins. It has been suggested, were Bruce Lee to have lived, this vehicle would have been his. Instead, the story was redesigned with a feminine twist and all the explosive action and martial arts confrontations were designed in the fertile mind of action Director Quinton Tarentino. From the first to the last, exciting sub-plots and well-choreographed martial arts scenes give this film it's special quality. The main target of B.B.'s revenge is of course none other than Master (Kung Fu) David Carradine as Bill. It is he and his 'Snake" team which consists of Lucy Liu who plays O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and Michael Madson who now become the intended targets. Interest in the film is ample as each killer has their own story and each contains the special formula of subtle sex, exciting physical confrontation and superb samurai action. In the end, what can be said of Kill Bill One? If this film is fantastic, I can't wait for part II. (of which there is) Excellent. ****


                
(Minor Spoilers) Kill Bill is one of the classics from Quentin Tarantino. Honestly it's a little overrated in my opinion. It's not a bad movie at all though, I really enjoyed it. Kill Bill feels like one of those style over substance movies. Not to say there isn't any substance. There are some great character moments, but not enough. In a fast paced action movie there wasn't enough time to fully develop The Bride's character.The action is absolutely amazing. I mean there isn't much to say, it's just so good. It can be silly at times, but it's shot very well, with barely any shakey cam, and tons of creative shots. It's definitely the best part of the film. I can't praise the action enough. The choreography is great, and there's a ton of style to keep the action looking fresh. There's an anime section in the movie, which was beautiful, and honestly my favorite part. It sets up one of the O-Ren's character very well. I thought her chemistry with the bride was great. You really feel like they were friends, and there's almost sadness when they fight. What is so great about this film is how entertaining it is. The pacing is great, and it barley slows down. There's so much memorable moments and it's so quickly paced the movie feels like a breeze. It's one of those rare movies you could rewatch and not get tired of. This isn't to say the film doesn't have any flaws. I think it does.My big issue with this movie is how silly, convenient and unrealistic it can be. Obviously this isn't meant to be a realistic film, but there's only so much disbelief I can suspend. I mean she gets out of a populated hospital without being able to move her legs, so she's dragging herself through the hospital, all the way to the parking lot. Also The bride wins most of her fights because of luck. There's 2 times where she was shot, or a knife was thrown at her, and they just happened to miss. A character gets her arm chopped and she stays there for at least 10 minutes without any medical care and survives some how. Also you're telling me that everyone has swords instead of guns? I mean if you're really trying to kill her get some guns. The bride just does things that are humanly impossible, and as far as I know she's a normal human. Also you're telling me that a public place gets attacked and the police never comes?! A person who's supposed to be in a coma, ran away from the hospital, killed some guys isn't being pursued by the police and is able to book tickets to fly to another country. Did she bring her weapons on the plane?! It just doesn't make sense. There's only so much stuff I can ignore, eventually it starts to annoy me. Also I have to mention that some of the sound editing isn't very good. A lot of the sounds are clearly re-used. I mean they used the Wilhelm scream twice. I'm not saying every sound has to be different, but it shouldn't be noticeable.My final problem with the movie is lack of character development. We just barely know anything about the bride. The beginning actually sets up the plot very well and very quickly, and we don't really need to know much about her, but she needs more character development, and history. I mean how does she know all these martial arts? There's only 2 characters who are set up, the bride and O-Ren. O-Ren was literally shown in a flashback. That anime sequence was seriously amazing though.I do have to complement the film thought for being so violent and actually really dark. The violence is just glorious. The blood fountains are unrealistic, but it's so great to see. The Action is just amazing, some of the best in all cinema. The fight with the Crazy 88?! Wow. Even the fist fights are great, ripping through walls, breaking everything, grabbing furniture and throwing it at each other. I do have to say the ending was underwhelming though. There's also a ton of hidden dark themes in the film. I'm sure they wanted to delve deeper into them, but the MPAA Ratings wouldn't allow it. That's actually why some of the fights are in black and white or hidden. I did wish they could've delved more into the psyche of the characters.Anyways in conclusion, I think this is a very flawed movie, it's silly, has a ton of plot convenience, it's hard to believe at times, and there's barely any character development, but I would be lying if I didn't enjoy this film. The direction, sound track, fight choreography, cinematography is just all amazing. The movie never gets boring, and you're always on the edge of your seat. It also has some surprisingly dark moments, and the violence is just glorious. For the last time, that anime sequence was amazing. Kill Bill is a good, but very flawed action movie.7/10
Surprisingly wasn't the worst thing i ever watched!! philosophically meaningless to me personally since imo she should've just straight up killed bill and i doubt the next movie is gonna have her going through personal healing or tackling the question of if there is good enough in the world or humans that cruelty can be forgiven. love all the nuanced female characters and gogo and oren didn't deserve that tbh. also really gross thing was really gross but at least we got to see both of them die. also a bit :/ since all of the girls despite being very accomplished were ultimately under some gross man's control like. can they never escape the patriarchy. anyway really well made but didn't change my life
RELEASED IN 2003 and written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, "Kill Bill: Vol. 1" is an action/thriller/fantasy starring Uma Thurman as The Bride who seeks vengeance on the team of assassins who betrayed her, a group of which she once belonged. Her journey takes her from El Paso to Pasadena to Okinawa. Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, ravishing Julie Dreyfus and Michael Madsen appear as various assassins or accomplices."Kill Bill" is a creative mish-mash of 60s-70's Bond-isms, Spaghetti Westerns and martial arts flicks, but with modern production values. It sometimes plays like a superhero movie in that The Bride is essentially an anti-superheroine who mows down literally armies of skilled fighters, e.g. the overly drawn-out B&W fight with the Crazy 88s. I loved the inclusion of Ennio Morricone's "Death Rides a Horse."On the downside, there's an overlong lame anime sequence and the characters lack substance and realism, but who can deny the film's pizzazz? Sure, it's style over substance, but it's entertaining in a voguish, quirky way. Since both parts were meant to be ONE MOVIE, it's mandatory to see "Vol. 2" to properly appreciate and appraise "Kill Bill." The second part fills in the holes.THE MOVIE RUNS 111 minutes and was shot in Texas, California, Mexico, Tokyo, Beijing and Hong Kong.GRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)


                
The movie wasn't what I expected it to be. It missed some essential elements, the dialogue and the subtle transition between the songs. A part of this is compensated by the cartoon and Japanese martial art, shown in a way which isn't very common for Hollywood productions. The excessive use of blood in the movie makes it very clear that what you are viewing isn't real. Previous movies of Tarrentino are more realistic thus having a bigger impact. But, the use of this much blood gives it an new edge. Watching this movie inspires me to view a Japanese martial art movie, since this must have been a big inspiration for Tarrentino.When reading the different comments I get the impression everybody likes the movie because `Tarrentino' made it. I wonder if everybody likes this movie this much if it were produced by somebody else.It's a good movie, and you should certainly go and view it. But don't expect to much of it.7,5/10


                
Can't really say if this movie is good or not, because half of it is missing. What we get is a splatter samurai movie with lots of well-choreographed sword fighting scenes, lots of dismembered bodies, lots of blood, lots of very dry, gutwrenching humour and the coolest Uma Thurman ever. What we don't get is a decent movie, because some greedy guy somewhere decided to split the movie in two parts so that they could make more money with it. Which is especially annoying as they could well have edited 10-15 minutes out of this part, to make a 3 1/2-hour movie total - Indian filmmakers do that all the time.Anyway, I'll give the film a proper rating after I've seen part 2, which will probably be in a few months. As it stands at the moment, a disconected fragment of a splatter comic that's been turned into a film, it's only Uma Thurman that warrants a 7/10.


                
Just came back from the movie. I've seen a lot of good comments and some people even praising the "Mind blowing' action scenes.Have you ever seen the huge canvas arts that are done by great artists? It may be simply two lines of paint but considered a master piece (maybe sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars) but if I do the same no body would even want to consider it since I am not a great artist.  The difference is that the great artist did draw those lines with a purpose, to describe something. But I simply draw that to make money.When we look at the movie that's the idea came to me. The movie would have rated very low if it's attached to an amateur director's name. But knowing Torentino, We start to see the purpose of those amateur like rendorations of the story.The Story: Not a powerful story to tell. We almost know what the story. It's very predictable and some times looks like a Hindi movie. I think the story is trying to take a road between abstract movie and a direct story and hence loose its power.Fights: Not very convincing. It is trying to establish an "Honorable Killing" code but I cannot see it as a very good success story. As the director is "lost" between reality and abstraction we audience also lost in several scenes.  For example those fountains of blood, that keep on showering when ever a limb is chopped is something not natural. (I would have laughed if this happened in pulp fiction, but was not so sure whether it's done purposely or just a bad special effects seen) I can see that torentino trying to establish a Japanese Comic story like (No pun intended) style in those fights. But that effort has not given enough fruits and does not distinguish these fights from any other Hong Kong based "Kung-fu" movie.Acting: I was never an Uma Thurman fan. I always thought she over act in her movies. I don't think she is doing any good for this movie either. The acting is very shallow and shows no emotion. (I think she took the "This bride is not an emotional person" statement literary ant try to avoid showing any emotion at all.  But I did like the Lucy Lou' acting. She was showing that ruthless killer character very well. Also her body guard. I think Lucy Lou would have been a better selection for the main role. (What an Asian heroin character. No way!!!) No we are not resists. But, No way an Asian for main character. (pun Intended)
Camera: hmm I am no expert on this. But I cannot see anything exceptional in camera side. Direction: There are few places I liked the way the movie is presented. But I am sure Torentino has more talent than we could see it in this picture. Not the best one from him. I would consider Kill Bill as an experiment gone wrong by Torentino. He was trying to develop a different style of story telling as always. But this time it's not a success. Any one seen Indian "General Formula" Movies would find this movie is such a movie minus the songs and the boy friend.Not the best movie I've seen. I can give 7/10 that's assuming this as an experiment gone wrong. If I ever see Torentino speaking this other-wise will change the vote to 5/10.PS I wonder which air line allow Samurai Swords in the cabinPSPS plsase excuse me for the language. English is not my first language


                
Don't read this if you don't want the plot spoiled a little bit.Well, it's definitely Tarantino. And as it goes I also think it's a little too "stylized" in the words of my roommate. The bloody action scenes are a cross between old school kung fu films like "Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky" and Monty Python. In essence, I think it was overdone in some places ... an attempt to make the film too campy. It was obvious the director (Tarantino) was striving to achieve the campiness of originals.Also, that whole thing about the coma-raping and Buck - unnecessary. Albeit, it does explain how she got out of the hospital and overcame atrophy, but that could have been done in dozens of other ways without such gratuitous sex-and-violence nonsense. And if I thought it was excessive (and I don't mind the intestine scenes in any of the kung fu films I've seen), then I can only imagine what other folks thought ... especially the Italians I was with in Firenze who don't mind all-out sex scenes, but edit the least bit of blood from everything.However, this didn't mar the cinematography or story. I came away knowing I had seen a movie, and, even if I never suspended disbelief enough to fully lose myself in The Bride's suffering or whatever, I did enjoy a great revenge story. Plus, it had all the classics: the one man (or woman) army against incredible odds, the sword-blade reflection shot, the ridiculous Asian weaponry (the chain-ball-sickle minus the sickle that Go Go Yubari had), and that shot of Uma from underneath the glass dance floor was cool, too.Yes, this movie was a great time and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks that they can stomach it. It's well done and enjoyable, so go see it or if that's not an option, at least rent it when it comes out on DVD or video.


                
This is a well made movie (which is not necessarily the same thing as a good movie). In fact this movie is very well directed by Tarantino's usual iron hand in a succession of violent scenes some of them curiously impregnated by a poetical atmosphere revealed not only in the scenery that frames them but also by the excellent music and songs conveyed by the sound track which at times has moments of great lyricism. Most sequences pay visual tribute to Japanese cartoons and the movie contains itself some sequences made up actually by cartoons in that style. If we take for granted the usually unplausible scenes in this kind of movies (e. g. the heroin coming of a coma and recovering almost at once all her physical fighting strength) we'll appreciate the firm way by which this movie is made and will become fascinated by its exciting atmosphere. There is a small flaw in the plot consisting in the lack of a quite understandable explanation for the attempted killing of the heroin at her wedding ceremony as well as for the actual killing of all the other people there. Since she was herself a killer maybe it was a squaring of accounts within the gang. Anyway this detail is not very important. Well some people might say that this movie purports a lot of gratuitous violence. Yes this may be true but if we read the daily papers or watch TV news bulletins don't we hear about lots of this kind of violence performed everyday in real life? Hasn't someone already said that mankind is creating a society of monsters with its consumerist values? Do these movies impel people towards crime and violence more than society does or on the contrary they arouse in most people a strong aversion for violent behaviour? This is a vexed question for psychologists and sociologists to solve. Anyway personally I'm against all forms of violence and I never said this was or wasn't a good movie. But I reaffirm that in pure formal terms (disregarding its content) it's a well made movie. And one more remarkable feature: this is a feminist movie in a certain sense. In fact I can't remember seeing a violent movie where women's roles are so much more important than men's like in this one.


                
It is not easy to interpret my summary, and I actually have the same feeling after watching Kill Bill: Vol. 1.I had very big expectations to this new Tarantino movie, I had hoped it would be just as good as Pulp Fiction. It was maybe a bit much to expect, but you should not expect less from such a talented director.The actors chosen for this movie are chosen wisely, I really like Uma Thurman, she has "it" as Bobby Bowfinger calls it. It is hard to describe what it is, but it us a combination of personality and talent. The rest of the cast was also good, but Uma Thurman is especially a fantastic experience.The action is good too, but it is actually a problem. Tarantino seems to be obsessed with impressive fight scenes, so he forgets to get flow in the story. At the same time I must admit that I am not a fan of the fight scenes used in "Matrix" and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", I prefer fight style ala Indiana Jones with fists, it is much more cool. It is maybe not as artistic, but it is how fight scenes should be.Another Tarantino obsession is blood, and I actually like the use of blood as in Pulp Fiction or the Verhoeven style, but the use of blood in this movie was more like the Monty Python style, and it does not work in the long run in this movie. I could laugh a few times because of the extreme use of blood, but it could not keep the comical element for all 111 minutes.As you can read from my review, I was not as pleased as I had hoped. The movie was without doubt beautifully made, but the plot was maybe a bit too thin and the story moved too slowly. Despite all this the movie deserves 7/10, but do not expect this to be a classic like Pulp Fiction.


                
When going to see Kill Bill i expected a very good amount of blood, i was not let down.  The Movie immediately starts off with a bang, with a wild knife fight between Fox and Thurman.  Then, as Tarantino loves so much to do, the movie takes an out of order hour+ long detour explaining the shtick(or plot) of the movie.  While some of this excursion is a little boring, or a little disturbing, any points lost are more than made up for in the end.  An epic fight sequence stacking Thurman up against over 88 bad guys(and girls) in black, in a fight scene in which over 100 gallons of fake blood was used.  This fight is in my opinion far and away the best part of the film, with such excessive gore that it is funny.  While Kill Bill, isn't quite as solid as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction as far as plot is concerned, you should not leave the theater disappointed.


                
A masterful film by Tarantino. He numbs the audience towards the violence by making it funny, and creating some amazingly realistic fight sequences. The music is incredible, and dubbed in at all the right places. There is an amazing animation scene. The acting is not incredible, but adequate. Sonny Chiba gives the best performance as Hattori Hanzo. I am not a huge fan of massive amounts of violence, but stylistically this film is a masterpiece.


                
A bit disappointing, after all the hype. But this is a well-made movie, nevertheless. It deserves a second viewing, and perhaps after that, my mind will change for the better.I understand that this movie is a tribute to Hong Kong and Japanese martial arts movies throughout the decades. And everyone seems to know that Tarantino had been a long time Asian cinema fan, and that Kill Bill is his dream project.Well, to be honest, the movie come across as a blend of different genre. At one side it is an unforgiving and violent Japanese crime movie. On the other side it is purely Tarantino.My only problem after watching the movie was there was simply nothing to talk about. The movie came about as a shallow gorefest flick. That's about it. The soundtrack and setting was not bad though, and I did enjoy the verbal jokes with Hattori Hanzou.


                
OK, I'll admit that I did know it was a 2 part film series.  However, by the time that Kill Bill had finished, leaving a tantalysing wait till the sequel, I'd forgotten!This has had much criticism, but if people don't like Tarantino, then they just shouldn't go to see his films.  As the bride left for dead, Uma Thurman gives her usual good performance as she starts hunting down her assailants before she goes for Bill himself.Lucy Liu gives the best performance in a cast that features several of the Tarantino regulars, including Michael Madsen again.Worth a look, although there is much gruesome violence.  The swordfight with Thurman vs All of Japan is the best part.


                
I really wanted to like Kill Bill. I thought (and still think) Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece of creativity that was still realistic.
Kill Bill is a masterpiece of creativity, but is a cartoon. I'm sure Tarantino meant it to be so (at least I hope he did!). But it just fell in love with itself a bit too much. Especially the massacre in the restaurant, which had no particular point to make after the fourth amputation. Monty Python did it right -- four amputations in one scene is the max. Anything more is wasting my time.
I'm just guessing that Kill Bill would've made a good movie, but expanded, extended and then carved into two "volumes", it just gets a bit too narcissistic.


                
I have been a huge Tarantino fan myself. I have always loved his insight and wit in his works. I know he owes Asian film-making tradition much in his creation, but I never thought that he lacked his creativity or originality. I rather admired his sense of style introducing flawlessly the part of that film history to his works without really ripping it off. He might have borrowed some ideas, but there have been many other things brilliant other than just HOMAGE to its tradition. At least, BEFORE KILL BILL Vol. 1.
Unfortunately, Kill Bill Vol. 1 can never be one of Tarantino¡¯s masterpieces so far. At best, it is no more than his so-so work. Although I am hesitant to say ¡®ripping off,¡¯ it too much depends on Asian cinema stereotypes, especially focusing on the cheesy ones.Do not misunderstand me. Trust me. Kill Bill Vol. 1 was really entertaining unless you hate his bloodthirsty taste. Acting was overall good. Especially Uma Thurman's performance was very impressive to me. All the characters are well defined. The chain-throwing school girl (you know, she is really almost 20 years old, not 17 years old.), one-eyed Daryl Hannah, and the Japanese-speaking Star Track vixen are all lovable. (If you did not watch the movie, you may not understand what the heck I am talking about.) The scenes are well captured and connected. Especially, if you have never seen the real Japanese animation (I am not talking about Pokemon!!), you will have the taste of the finest of the finest of its kind.
Also, as an Asian that I am, I have to admit that his understanding of Asian movies, stories, and even music are more than just a superficial level, although he probably got some helping hands. I laughed a lot listening to typical Japanese note of the background music on the scene after the duel of Uma and Lucy, and especially, when Uma and Lucy are talking about the craftsmanship of the sword even at the very end of Lucy's life, I was quite impressed.HOWEVER, it was too typical, nothing new, especially for Asian people. Let me say one thing to the people saying that the movie has something new, unique, or saying that the movie is the best of this year or all-time. Asian moviegoers have gone through tons of better ones if Kill Bill is that great. For example, Jet Li has had tons of better mass fighting scenes in his early works than ¡®Uma-to-Everyone else¡¯ in Kill Bill. I have even seen those one-to-everyone fighting scenes in TV soup operas many times this year. So PLEASE, SAVE the expression, ¡°THE BEST¡¯ until you see the originals. In addition, another complaint would be that I almost smell of stereotyping and orientalism. However, while it is not certainly pleasing, I would not discuss it more because stereotyping and school girl fetish certainly sell.
Again, don't misunderstand me. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I am just saying that it cannot be the masterpiece like many people think and that Tarantino could have done better than this. Kill Bill is nothing more than just a mishmash of things Asian unlike his real former masterpieces and Tarantino just succeeded in entertaining people putting the mishmash in the context of Hollywood.
KILL BILL!!! Just saw it and was I ever pleased. Tarantino's hiatus has left all his fans yearning for another blistering flick from the cinematic genius. He returns with KILL BILL: Vol. 1. He returns with style.The performances are all over the top, but this kind of tongue-in-cheek moviemaking calls for that kind of behavior. Uma Thurman is sensational, as well as Lucy Liu. Vivica A. Fox doesn't have much time to develop, so her performance can't be lauded too much. Daryl Hannah is promising, with more to come. Michael Madsen is almost non-existent. However, as with Daryl Hannah, he has more to come. David Carradine has yet to show his face but comes off riveting as the title character.The scenes move quickly and the flow of the movie is uneven. The movie really shines for its style and little bells and whistles. There is a great amount of detail, and the nods to martial arts culture such as the music, the formats used (there's even Anime), the costumes and the characters themselves are very enjoyable.In the opinion of this viewer, Tarantino, who is known for his great dialogue, has abandoned cleverness and gone more for emotion and in-your-face action. This film isn't very talkative and when characters are talking, it isn't engaging dialogue. You don't have fun with it. The dialogue is always building up to something and you almost always know what it is. The film is very straightforward. The flashbacks are a kick, giving further insight into the characters.This isn't totally important to talk about, but it still is a major part of the film. Violence. I mean some serious violence. This is one the bloodiest films I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot. Some of the deaths are appalling, and for that Tarantino needs to be praised. When you go over the top with a film, you have to go all out. One of the characters has an accident, ala the movie Hannibal, that has to be seen to believe. Innumerable limbs and oceans of blood are lost. It's great. This isn't a movie to take terribly seriously, you 're just supposed to have fun with it the way Tarantino probably did making it.Last but not least, twists. This film starts with a twist, cut off by a bang. I think most who saw the movie knew what Uma Thurman was about to say before she got that bullet in her head, which obviously didn't kill her, but only made her more angry. The bullet was courtesy of Bill, as mentioned in the trailers so I'm not giving anything away. He has a nice twist of his own, which serves as the last line to Vol. 1, leaving it in a cliffhanger.Where Vol. 2 will go, it's hard to say. If it is anything like Vol. 1, which I imagine it will be, then most are in for a real treat. KILL BILL is a great movie experience, with Tarantino at the wheel. Enjoy!


                
Kill Bill Vol.1 is a revenge story pure and simple. There are no gimmicky subplots, no characters that are not fully developed, it is a cut and dry film that leaves you craving for so much more.Uma Thurman was absolutely fabulous in her roll as "The Bride", she was perfect for the roll, and boy can she kick some tail.She is left for dead on her wedding day by a group of assasians and becomes comatose after the incident.She wakes up, hunts down the "Death List Five" and thats your story.Tarentino never fails to put out something remarkable and this left me in awe. It had to have been a tough decision for the studio to break this down in two, because you do sorta feel screwed at the end.But none the less, a really cool film with tons of blood and one of the most gorgeous heroines to ever grace the screen.And from the looks of the way the story went, Volume 2 will be better!Brew
