 One of those films you have to watch multiple times

 One of Kubrick's best

 Kubrick's best

 Kubrick and the Art of Violence.

 My brief review of the film

 amazing, the greatest villain ever, nothing has scared me more

 Best movie ever made

 The number one film of all time. **** out of ****

 The most thought provoking film of all time

 My favorite movie

 Academy Award nomination despite it's initial 'X' rating inspired fans along with Alex's sweet smile as he imagines the old in-out in the finale

 One of the greatest films ever made

 One of the most beautiful films I've seen...

 the story of a young vicious hoodlum whose primary interests are rape and Beethoven and his supposed cure.

 The art of violence.

 Sick in a way, but excellent

 Everyone is the Villain

 Of course it's perfect!

 A Terrific Masterpiece

 Brilliant piece of film making that will burn you.

 Kubrick's Artistry At Work...

 psychological, entertaining, brilliant.

 "A Clockwork Orange II - An Aeon of Failure"

 A most unusual and disorienting movie experience

 Perhaps Kubrick's best?
