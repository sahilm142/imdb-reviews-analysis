 Rear Window is 64

 Our Obsession with Voyeurism

 Another Hitchcock masterpiece

 A Deep & Entertaining Classic

 Well of course when you've got nothing better to do with a broken leg you will accuse your neighbor of murder!

 Reading from Top to Bottom...Hitchcock's Sophisticated Masterpiece

 In the mid-fifties, Hitchcock brought remarkable suspense by reverting to the logic of a silent film (with an observer behind the lens as the hero)

 "Rear Window" describes Hitchcock at his best...

 Pure Class

 The Best Thriller I've Ever Seen

 Voyeurism, Murder, Stewart and Kelly Make for a Hitch High

 A Review on Rear Window

 The Master at his best.

 Repeat watch this Classic

 Hitchcock at his best!

 One of my all-time favorites that could justifiably be named Hitchcock's second best (with PSYCHO being number one).

 Great thriller

 An original, intruiging work... brilliantly cinematic

 Note, death, humor, suspense and genius.

 Hitchcocks Best, Cinemas Best

 Minimalist Suspense at its Best

 One of the best Hitchcock films ever besides Vertigo!

 You'll never leave the blinds up again...

 Looking at Urban Life ... through binoculars and voyeurism

 One of the greatest Hitchcock films, but not his best
