There's simply too much of those things taking away the screen time. I doubt anyone has a problem with gore and sex scenes, but when they fill up every episode with poor cgi, breasts and blood everywhere you only get that small % of the actual plot, which itself isn't that bad at all. Maybe it isn't that historically accurate representative of how the lives of the gladiators were during the ancient times, but they surely got the equipment right. Well, that is if you leave out a couple of bizarre weapons you see some of the 'gladiators' using.Also,Most of the fight scenes look way too unreal because of the slow motion topped with horrible cgi and way too much blood pouring from every edge of the screen. Speaking of cgi they seem to have hired people with a skill level of your average photoshop user. Still, from all the Spartacus series this one, God of the Arena, seems to have the least of cgi and blood pools.
