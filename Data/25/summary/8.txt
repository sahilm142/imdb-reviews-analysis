 Review

 Dramatic Turnaround Makes It Unforgettable

 Visually stunning, but uneven. For me the second half was better than the first

 A brave movie

 Beautifully-executed celebration of human spirit - no more, no less.

 What an Achievement

 A beautiful movie to learn beauty of the life regardless of any situation

 I cannot even begin to understand what an important film this is...

 I almost missed a truly wonderful film

 To See the Good Side of Life

 "When can I see Mama?"....

 Life is beautiful as to make it smart as everything depends on your attitude.

 a genius script

 American people really must see more foreign movies !

 Maybe not accurate, but important!

 Optimism, wits, and a bit of luck go a long way

 Touching Comedy-Drama

 "Life is Beautiful"

 Good movie,
