 In this criminal subculture, they cheat and rob each other.

 Good fun, but ultimately failing to live up to the comparisons

 Lively and influential

 Good start for Guy Ritchie

 Hugely enjoyable, but ultimately lightweight

 Tons of fun

 Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels

 Funny and ironic

 The dialogue will make you work, but it's worth it

 Deja Vu

 Clever but superficial comedy thriller

 the fun luck

 Keystone Cockney Crime Caper!

 Completely ridiculous, but loads of fun

 Guy Ritchie brings it home

 British films get better - but only just

 Gritty look at East End crime

 Laughs, Shocks, and Much Incredible Twists

 Fun, not totally original but somewhat, but definatly BRITISH!

 I didn't think it was that great. I liked it though.

 Some flaws but generally a fine introduction to the gangster movie Guy Ritchie style

 A brilliant British film

 Very good, but Snatch surpasses it.

 Guy Ritchie's directorial debut Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is a work of artistic originality as well as an accurate portrayal of life as an Eastender.
