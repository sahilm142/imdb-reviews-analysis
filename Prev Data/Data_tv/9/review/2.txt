It's funny and that's it
That's It
Lazy writing at it's finest, uses immature humor with scientific depth and that's it
I like it but it's too atheist and toxic and it just pisses me off, again it's a pretty good show but.....
It's not that good


                
If you think that an alcoholic burping after every sentence and a kid with little to no confidence at all being unsure about something sounds pretty funny to you, you might wanna give the first episode a go. If you think that sounds extremely funny, you might wanna give the entire series a go, because that's all it is in a nutshell
