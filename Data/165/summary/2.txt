 What Did I Miss Here?!

 I don't get why people liked this...

 A highly overrated piece of garbage

 In retrospect, a very mean and insensitive film

 Incredibly mediocre film for Academy Award Winner

 Just as wretched as any other Coen Bros. epic

 Oh, and some gruesomeness with a wood chipper.

 Thriller? Hardly. Overrated? Certainly

 "Fargo" is highly overrated

 Over Rated

 Remind me never to visit North Dakota

 This Movie Is Tragic not Comic

 Disappointed.

 Quirkiness for quirkiness' sake

 Coen Brothers .. overrated as per usual

 Whats wrong whit you people?

 not a bad story but at the end American type of flick!

 Great movie, but FALSE

 I just don't understand it...

 Its just not funny

 What an amazingly and thoroughly disappointing movie.
