 Great entertainment that deserves to be judged by its own merits

 Endeavour Magic

 Fantastic and surprising in the good sense, despite my initial doubts as a Morse's fan

 The difficult first of the 'real' series is an amazing success

 Best Ever!

 Excellent, but Allam steals the show

 Charming drama

 The last TV show worth watching

 A show that proves TV dramas can beat movies any day.

 Endeavour stands on its own, even if you've never seen Thaw's Morse

 Stellar TV

 Every episode an evening well spend.

 The very best of PBS

 A more than worthy, and almost as good, prequel series to Inspector Morse

 Homages

 Liked Morse but I really love Endeavour.

 Initial fears blown away

 Why has this gripped me more than Morse

 Outstanding, intelligent and emotive

 Enjoy, even if you can't turn back the clock.

 Best detective series

 An intriguing and engaging period piece of detective fiction

 No spoiler here, just an encouragement to embrace "Endeavour"

 Morse cleans up the colleges of Oxford

 If there were 11 stars, I would rate them
