Tarantino's brutal debut film. From the original initial dialogue, to the final outcome, the director astonishes everyone and makes clear his style: anthological dialogues (pay attention to the discussion in the distribution of colors that will identify each gangster, hilarious) a breakthrough structure, very good soundtrack (as in all his films), great doses of violence (although not at all gratuitous, but rather ironic) and, above all, a lot of black humor. In addition to superb performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. In short, a great example of good noir cinema (with all its ingredients: shootings, violence, betrayal, suspense, etc.), but with the innovative and very personal touch of the brilliant director, who would later continue to dazzle with the wonderful "Pulp Fiction". Oh, and the scene from the beginning with "Little Green Bag" is legendary. 10/10


                
Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that "less is more." This doesn't apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen, you're looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors, there's no make-up to make them look pretty, there's little to no comic relief, and most important of all, there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in, a detrimental trademark of so many action films, as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage, Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible, and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery. Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.
Make no mistake, Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made, and some scenes are really painful to watch, but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten.


                
The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying "Wheres all the violence", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.This is one of the movies I don't get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: "Are you gonna bark all day...", "I'll make you my dog's bitch". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don't know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there's a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino's best movie. I didn't care much for the "Kill Bill" movies, but who cares, I'm not reviewing them.If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now.


                
A couple of weeks ago, I was blessed with a rare opportunity. one of the movie theaters in town did a midnight showing of this. Naturally, being a "Dogs" freak, I went down and saw it.To say I was blown away would be an understatement. I have only seen two of Mr. Tarantino's films in the theater. This being one, and "Kill Bill" being the other. I only became a fan of his a year ago and have subsequently seen all of his films and own them all.It really was a treat to be able to sit in the movie theater and watch this while eating grossly overpriced popcorn and drinking a grossly overpriced soda.For those who don't know, the film involves a jewelry heist. Six strangers including Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Eddie Bunker, Tarantino himself, and Tim Roth are recruited by a crime boss named Joe Cabot, (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Eddie, whom everybody calls "Nice Guy" (Chris Penn). The six are almost all friends or associates of Cabot, particularly Keitel and Madsen. Cabot gives them colors for names (Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blue, etc.) And expressly forbids them to reveal anything about themselves to each other, so if anyone is caught, no one can inform on anybody. But the heist goes wrong, the cops seem to show up way to fast, some members of the group are killed, and the rest start returning to the rendesvous point to try to sort out what went wrong. After the arrival of Mr. Pink, They realize that one of the number is a police informer. The arrival of Mr. Blonde, and the present he has in his trunk, complicates things even more. Things are also complicated by the fact that since no one knows each other, discovering who the informer is is given added difficulty, since no one trusts each other.This film, Tarantino's first, is one of the best, if not the best one he has ever done. but part of this credit has to go to his outstanding cast. Keitel is an old pro at this type of thing, he has the distinction of being the first older actor who's career seemed to be going into a slump and who has recovered thanks to Tarantino's casting. But Tarantino can't claim sole credit for that, because Keitel really got the ball rolling on the project and help him score his budget and the prominence to gain his cast. Buscemi IS Mr. Pink. Tarantino wrote the role for himself, and he would have been good, but Buscemi brings a type of weasly professionalism to the role that no one else could. Penn and Tierney are ideally cast as the father and son who are left to sort out the mess of the robbery, Bunker is only in a few scenes but livens up the proceedings. Tarantino gives himself the perfect monologue for his character (Like a Virgin is a metaphor for big d*cks), and Tim Roth gives a spectacular performance as Mr. Orange, who is relegated to bleeding on the floor for a large chunk of the movie. His scene in the car when he has just been shot is particulary outstanding. But then, of course, I have to throw out a special nod to my favorite character in the piece, Mr. Blonde, as portrayed by Michael Madsen. Blonde is the definition of "Bad*ss", and Madsen fits him like a glove. His first scene back at the warehouse is particularly memorable, as is the "Ear torture sequence". Without Madsen's portraying of Mr. Blonde, I don't think the "Ear" scene would have worked, Madsen just does something with it that nobody else can. Not only does Blonde have most of the coolest lines, he's fun to watch on screen, especially his reaction to a gun pointed in his face by Mr. White. Madsen rocks!"Dogs" Is one of the few movies where I don't think thae casting could have been any better. Part of the reason it works as well as it does has to go the the way the cast works with each other. No one seems to think that they are better than anyone else, and no one seemed to approach the project with the stuck up feeling of how bad it was that they were doing an indie film on a low budget and with an unknown director. Every single member of the cast gives everything he (or, to a much lesser extent, she) has. It's this mindset that, I think, has made "Dogs" the classic it is today. Little could be improved upon.As a side note, This came out a year after "Thelma and Louise" which also stars Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen. However, in "Dogs" They play ruthless characters. In "T&L" they play the only sympathetic Male characters in the entire movie. An ideal would be to watch "T&L" then "RD" and really see the difference. They are two great actors, and they deliver. And for those who enjoyed Madsen in this, I also recommend "Kill Me Again", made a few years earlier, and which also features a scene where he tortures someone."Dogs" is a great film to watch. Not a date flick, but for a cops and robbers movie, it's perfect. Seeing it for the first time in a theater, it hasn't lost it's touch, and the "Stuck in the Middle with You"/Ear sequence has never been more intense or memorable.*****/***** !0/10
This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen and definately deserves its position on the Top 250. It's an acquired taste, but if you've been desensitised to violence (as i have), then you will want to watch this again from the minute it ends. Every single actor was perfectly fitted for its character. Steve Buscemi as the squirrely Mr. Pink, Harvey Keitel as the veteran Mr. White, and of course, Michael Madsen as the phsycotic Mr. Blonde. The list goes on and on.Some people said that the violence was unnecessary and didn't move the plot forward as it did with Pulp Fiction. I agree, but the violence was used to develop the character's personalities. It showed their disregard for human life and that our anti-heros saw killing a cop as being as stepping on a cockroach .I urge future viewers of this movie not to instantly compare it to Pulp Fiction and enjoy it as it's own film. An interesting thrill-ride crime drama from beginning to end, I give this film *****/*****


                
I watched this movie for the first time without knowing what the movie was about. I remember hearing about how cool this movie was and I saw people wearing shirts and listening to the soundtrack, but I had never seen it. So when it first came out on DVD, I bought it without ever watching it before. In Tarantino I trust. For good reason. This is a classic movie, a throwback. A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a great cast, great script, and flawless direction. Taratino films are great because they stress the story more than anything else. In all of his movies, the script is strong enough to carry the movie. Now add good over the top acting and you have a hit. The realism of this movie is what grabs you. You really feel like you are in that abandoned warehouse. If felt privileged to have bought such a movie without watching it first. An instant classic. I love this movie!


                
Bloodily violent, irreverently shocking, politically incorrect, inventively funny and so on and so forth<U+0085> I'm trying to find the right expression to describe "Reservoir Dogs" and I finally got it, it stands in three letters: N-E-W. There was something waiting in the abyssal wombs of cinema, so repressed it was waiting for deliverance with a fierce impatience, a deliverance with a quite original and cool-sounding name: Quentin Tarantino, the new incarnation of modern violence with STYLE. "Reservoir Dogs" is more than a debut; it's a sensational entrance that consecrated Tarantino among the most influential directors of his generation, and THE reference in independent film-making.Tarantino invented a new style that would never desert his films, and would make each of his creation, the epitome of coolness. It's so fresh to watch "Reservoir Dogs" now and to realize how new it was at that time. I remember the first time I watched the film, I was 17, and the movie literally blew me away in every single aspect, and I guess the fact that I wasn't familiar with the Internet or IMDb was a good thing since it didn't intercede with my approach of the film. I didn't want to know what's so cool about Tarantino, I just discovered him with his film, shortly after watching "Pulp Fiction", and for some reason, I loved "Reservoir Dogs" a little more. Tarantino quickly became my favorite director as a teenager, and in my early 20's because of this level of creativity in the writing, the directing, and the editing.The writing is Tarantino's trademark and his greatest quality, the movie starts with a whole discussion about the meaning of "Like a Virgin" told by a fast-speaking Tarantino, himself as Mr. Brown, then a whole debate starts about tipping and non tipping. That's the question raised by the first minutes of "Reservoir Dogs" and the least we could say is that the talk is so trivial it sounds real and authentic in its rawness and makes the characters more human, if not sympathetic. More generally, the whole characterization is driven by dialogs so delicately vulgar you never miss the action, or wait for something 'to happen'. Script 'happens' in Tarantino's films, like meals you've already eaten but with a new special taste, something juicy, creamy, and spicy. It's almost an indigestion of creativity <U+0085> I don't need to tell you the lines, if I start them, you know the rest : "You shoot me in a dream <U+0085>", "Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?" etc. etc. And these dogs not only bark, but they do bite a lot.Indeed, if the movie was all dialogs, it wouldn't have had the same impact. It's like Tarantino already knew his lesson, and wanted to make something big, from the beginning. From the iconic slo-mo walking scene down the alley with the opening credits, you get the idea that this "Little Green Bag" song will be the 'hallelujah' glorifying the birth of a new style of film-making, and instinctively, you know something special will happen after these credits, and you're not disappointed by what follows. Blood, blood all over the car seat, and probably one of the most convincing painful screams ever. You really can feel for Tim Roth in that scene, it's like the real actor got one real bullet, and the rest is the touching expression of a growing friendship between Roth as Mr. Orange, and Mr. White, his mentor played by Harvey Keitel. He combs his hear, whispers something that provoke Orange's cute but heartbreaking smile: the chemistry is so believable, you understand that the movie is not just about cool dialogs. Then, comes Mr Pink as Steve Buscemi, asking who the rat is! Because this is the first serious element we have. It's the story of a botched jewel robbery, with a traitor among these gangsters. This question will be the starting point of the narrative with three specific back stories told in flashback.The three characters depicted in flashback are Mr. White, Mr. Orange, and Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde. And in the memorable-action department, the winner is undoubtedly Mr. Blonde: the one who provided the most iconic and recognizable moment of the film. The iconic ear-cutting scene with the "Stuck In the Middle With You" music, like a reminiscence of "A Clockwork Orange" rape scene with 'Singin' in the Rain' as a musical background, the scene is disturbing, violent, bloody, but also <U+0085> iconic. The violence is not meant to be cool, but just to show how psychotic Mr. Blonde, one of the most twisted gangster villains, is. And his torture is also crucial because it will unmask Mr. Orange as the snitch, and will make his relationship with White, even more complex. In one minute, the movie raises a new dimension, deeper and more tragic.Forget the cool and raunchy dialogs, the creative editing, where flashbacks interfere with parallel stories, as when we witness a great scene where Orange tells a story within another story. Too many insertions as to create a confusing feeling until the last iconic scene : after the slo-mo opening, the ear-cutting, the Mexican stand-off, as the last memorable scene that would lurch this movie into Pop Culture. Forget the wonderful ensemble cast with so many colorful characters (literally) and such believable actions and reactions like childishly arguing about nicknames instead of preparing a serious job. All these elements are great, but it would have been nothing without the tragedy <U+0085> The beauty of the film relies on this profound relationship between Mr. Orange and Mr White, made of respect and honor, and the last minute of the film was something that reminded of Peckinpah's films, a moment of honesty and loyalty, incarnated by Orange's last confession, and White's heartbreaking gesture as to redeem the act of a man he still loved as friend <U+0085> Keitel's last look before the movie ends will haunt me forever.
Four of six ruthless criminals await for their boss at an abandoned warehouse. After finding the diamond heist that they had all teamed up to accomplish was a trap, they realize that one of them is a police informant.The movie is told through a series of flashbacks from each of the criminals. I have never seen this done so breathtakingly. "Dogs" is an absolute masterpiece. It may not be Tarantino's best but is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. There is absolutely nothing between the satirical writing or the hard-to-watch murders that could possibly make the movie any more perfect. Overall, the movie is absolutely incredible and I do not wish to say anymore to give away any sense of the ending.I highly recommend this movie.


                
...this is the whole damn meal. "Reservoir Dogs" is about a crime gone horridly awry, and it makes no apologies for its violence, slurs, and language.  It doesn't have to, because of its brilliant, gripping script and plot twists, acting that makes you think these people are real, and a flashy presentation of it all. Quentin Tarantino came on the scene not with a whimper but a bang with this story of a diamond heist which is foiled by an undercover cop--one of the criminals.   The story unfolds backwards, beginning with Quentin Tarantino waxing poetic on Madonna's "Like a Virgin", and manages to cover Tim Roth writhing around in Harvey Keitel's backseat with a bullet in his stomach, Michael Madsen with a straight razor and a bound & gagged cop, Chris Penn crying rape in his father Laurence Tierney's office, and other insane, violent, and/or hilarious plot lines leading to a dazzling end.  The soundtrack adds just the right amount of style and superiority, which you'll understand immediately when the Dogs walk in slo-mo to the tune of "Little Green Bag". This movie can only compare to "Pulp Fiction" with its brilliance, otherwise, it is completely and utterly a unique experience.
Reservoir Dogs will always go down as one of the most violent yet brilliant pieces of work ever to be shown on the silver screen. Tarrentino's script is brilliant and what is even more amazing is that it is his first movie. The acting is top grade , all the actors seem to come up with the performance of lives. There were calls when the film was released for it to be banned by the lilly livered liberals and while this is bloody and the language is coarse, for it to be banned would have deprived us of a classic Hollywood movie that oozes class as well as blood! 10 out of 10


                
I have to say- coming back to this film after so many years- it still packs a Tarantino punch. Very witty, edgy and gritty. Painful moments and perhaps some of the most violent scenes of our times. Not for the faint hearted but if you're into quirky badass gangster films, this one is for you.


                
Despite not being a high budget Tarantino film, it is my favorite one. I saw Pulp Fiction indeed, but there are some things:
1) The cinematography in Reservoir Dogs (for me) is slightly better, as it captures every moment perfectly.
2) Characters are more understandable.
3) Movie focuses on same characters who are connected to the same story which makes it easier to follow.I believe all of the actors did a pretty good job. Movie is violent no doubt so be careful if you're new to Tarantino. If you already know him and like his movies you've probably seen this but if you haven't, go see it. Also note that the gunplay is remarkably good.10/10 (Orginally a 9/10 but I had to give an extra point for the rewatchability factor)


                
"Reservoir Dogs" has great casting, an amazing script, awesome characters and a classic sound track. Perhaps Mr. Pink should move to Australia, a society that tips only when someone deserves it and not because they are doing their job. It is very rare that I give a movie a 10 out of 10, but this movie is just gold.


                
Reservoir Dogs (1992) is a slow paced story-driven flick about a heist gone wrong.It's a Tarantino's movie, so go on for it knowing that: plot is not linear, there's a lot of swearing, acting is great, story is awesome. Enough said!


                
This movie was so boring and long I dont see why you guys like this so much. I rent this because of all the hype around it but it sucks. I know you will hate me for saying this but point break was better than this. Now the acting was good but it couldn't save this crap of a movie that you call a classic.


                
Whenever the name Quentin Tarantino is mentioned nowadays, people treat him with the same reverence as Scorsese, De Palma, and other directors as such who have fiddled around with the crime/gangster genre to create personal, heavy-duty masterworks.  However, at the time this film was first released, as was with his still best picture 'Pulp', he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies, filled with violence, chock full of violence, "too violent" (if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies), etc. This is unfair.  True, Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there, and true he shows the blood, he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair, and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame.  Yet he never exactly displays any truly violent acts (he decided to leave the shot of Masden slicing the ear on the editing floor, unlike a director like David Lynch who gets right inside the matter) - his technique is to evoke and strive for all of the emotions one would feel in such asituation, movie or in real life, to the most honest, near heart-wrenching limits, and thus to someone who may have even not even seen the film the images that appear in a trailer or on a video box bring the notion of this being an overly violent movie immediately.  That the images we see throughout the film, bloody or not, stay with us long after the credits roll, is a testament to his dedication, and obvious trust, to his craft being as it is.The plot, while lifted from a Chow-Yun Fat film from the mid-eighties, is the first one to include his trademark non-linear storytelling design. Sure, this is not uncommon in most films, but since each scene has a meaty quality to it, with line after line of (purposeful, to story as well as character) dialog is spoken, you really don't know what to expect.  A crime boss (Lawrence Tierny) assembles different criminals of different backgrounds, removes them of their given Christian names, and gives them pseudonym colors as the heist comes up.  The robbery itself has a big hitch- cops are alerted sooner than thought, shoot-outs occur, some colors are wiped away, and the remaining assemble in the rendezvous to sort out what went wrong and who's to blame.  For most films with such an ambitious and grounded script, nearly every performance is a crucial asset to the film's success, and Tarantino knows this in his bones, as well as in the casting of the right parts (i.e. Steve Buscemi auditioned for Mr. White but got Mr. Pink, makes sense doesn't it): Keitel and Tierny are like old pros merely portraying old pros; Roth has a true breakout performance as Orange; Busemi himself proves why he's needed in film today; Chris Penn makes for a fine supporting role; Masden is one of the most convincing of the 90's psychos; even Tarantino makes a perfect monologue for himself in the opener.  Right away these actors give off the only impression they should - these are people that we can care about, despise, or watch in a lack of judgment as they float away in a flash - they've got to be human all the way.  So, is Reservoir Dogs for everyone?  Not necessarily- children under the age of nine or ten, I'd suggest, should stay away even if they can understand and take the violence since it's really an film for maturer mindsets.  But, for the passionate movie-goer, or for thrill seeking screen nuts, it's worth the ride.  For one thing, I'll never think of "Stuck in the Middle With You", or Steven Wright for that matter, the same way again.  My opinion- Tarantino's 3rd best effort behind Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn, and nearly superior over Jackie Brown.  A+


                
#1 Best Film of 1992When most people are asked what their favorite movie or the best film of all time is they are quick to give general responses like 'The Godfather' or 'Schindler's List' or 'Apocalypse Now', but not me. Yep, my favorite film of all time didn't even get one single Academy Award Nomination. It did get a couple of Independent Spirit Award Nominations though, and received an award for Best Supporting Actor. This movie is 'Reservoir Dogs', Quentin Tarantino's absolutely amazing film debut that stayed with me for longer then any other film I've seen. I don't know how to explain how much I love this film, but I'll try.The film plays a lot like a play (it takes place mostly in one location - a warehouse.) The story follows six small-time crooks from different backgrounds, they are Mr. White (Harvey Keitel - Bad Lieutenant) a middle-aged old-school con with a mean streak but strong conscious, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - Kill Bill Vol. 2) a psychopathic hardened criminal with a sick sense of humor and a deep hatred for cops, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - Fargo) a nasty, cheap and down-to-the-point little guy who's very street smart and has some hysterical one-liners, Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino - the writer/director of the film) a wise-ass con with a grudge against Madonna, Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker - writer of Animal Factory) who we don't really know much about, and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth - Pulp Fiction) a young and ambitious guy who's really an undercover cop trying to frame the other cons. These six guys are put together by a gruff old timer criminal Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney - Dillinger) and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - Rumble Fish). Their plan is to knock-off a jewelry store in downtown Los Angeles that's getting a shipment of polished diamonds from Israel. The robbery doesn't go as well as they planned and the cops show up. The crooks get the diamonds but two of the six get killed during the robbery. The film never actually shows the robbery, because pretty much the whole movie takes place in an abandoned warehouse (the con's rendezvous place after the robbery). The surviving criminals start showing up there and try to figure out who set them up as they talk about the heist in retrospect. This powerhouse of a film features one of the very best screenplays ever written filled to the brim with rich and engrossing dialogue that will intrigue, repulse and shock you all at the same time. The acting is absolutely incendiary, with award worthy performances from Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and especially Steve Buscemi in a role which won him the Best Supporting Male trophy at the Independent Spirit Awards in 1992. The characters are so carefully detailed and layered that it seems like you've known them for all your life, which is probably thanks to not only Quentin Tarantino but the group of immensely talented veteran actors who play the four main roles. The directing is very impressive for a first-time filmmaker, Quentin Tarantino, and the cinematography is definitely worth noticing. Another wonderful factor of this incredible crime-drama is the the collection of 70's rock music. This will probably stir up memories of viewers 45-55 years of age.'Reservoir Dogs' is a marvelous achievement in cinema, but it's not for everyone. If you are squeamish this isn't the best movie for you. 'Reservoir Dogs' is perhaps one of the most violent American movies in recent years featuring gut-shots, prolonged bleeding, ear slicing and an extremely violent and sadistic torture sequence that is both horrifying and darkly hysterical. In conclusion, 'Reservoir Dogs' has enough energy to power a 747 and then some. To quote another movie critic reviewing another movie, Reservoir Dogs is better than perfect, it's thrillingly alive. That description impeccably describes Quentin Tarantino's first masterpiece. Grade: A+MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #1
When viewing information about different movies, and their respective reviews on this website, officials posted that this movie was likened to the film "Diner". At first, I found this to be a very peculiar comparison!! The minute I popped this movie into the DVD player, I realized the similarity to both movies, particularly with regards to the introductory dialog... I like this type of opening scene, the gist of it being whereby the incongruity of conversation effectively depicts the twisted character portrayals of the pivotal actors in the film !! The camera angles to the coffee shop pontifications, as illustrated in "Diner" and in "Resevoir Dogs", were extremely poignant!! As was the case with "Diner", "Resevoir Dogs" depicted an overtly energetic camaraderie with everyone conversing at the coffee shop table. The film, "Diner" provided a succinct illustration of kindred spirits which were precocious, with "Resevoir Dogs" the bonds were rather macabre!! Focusing now on "Resevoir Dogs", that guy who was adamant about not tipping the waitress struck an intensely sensitive nerve cord with me, as I used to be in the food and beverage industry. How did I feel about that guy? Put it this way, if he thinks his manner of killing someone is gruesome and sickening, once a bunch of bartenders get a hold of him, he ain't seen nothing yet... While I detest the term "ain't" as it is a colloquialism for the illiterate, it is seemingly appropriate in this case!! Speaking of colloquialisms, this movie was full of them. The F word was habitually used in the film "Resevoir Dogs", in fact it was the movie's favorite colloquialism!! The F word is basically an interjection, however, the usage of the F word demonstrates an amazing versatility which accommodates virtually every part of speech, it is very amenable when used a as a gerund as well!! Such an excessive use of this word in "Resevoir Dogs" bares a precarious resemblance to the movie "The Departed"... My G-Rated euphemisms are not displayed here because I am so delicate, rather, it is because I am aware of IMDb's comment guidelines!! This film was about a bunch of reprobates who were amused by their irrational conclusions, and delving into a complacently convoluted logic became their favorite hobby!! Why were all of the characters in this movie so thwarted? Come on!! I have to be at another appointment in about a half an hour!! When someone talks about seriously engaging in a first class felony, they get attention, once they totter with the idea of murder, people are all ears, at least they should be!! Such lamentations evoke a very lethal excoriation against the "establishment". Quentin Tarrantino directs this film, and, he is without a doubt, an unprecedented cannon of creativity!! His overall motif of blood and violence is his notoriously successful trademark, "Pulp Fiction" being his prize piece!! While compared to the movie "Diner" I may be one of the few who likes "Diner" better, of course, I am civilized!! Nevertheless, "Resevoir Dogs" is a remarkably well made movie which tries to use the recreation of murder as the ultimate and prevailing diatribe of circumstantial justification!! It ("Resevoir Dogs") has an innovative approach to larceny, and a criminal's code of ethics!! You watch "Resevoir Dogs", I will guarantee you that you will not be bored!! The acting, the directing, and the aggregate creation of this film, falls into the category of sensational entertainment... I give this film a perfect ten!! See it when you're angry!!


                
Reservoir Dogs, at least for me, is one of those films that sneak up on you in terms of long term opinion. The first time I'd seen Reservoir Dogs was after a wave of Tarantino enthusiasm having watched and loved Pulp Fiction, a film released two years after this little masterpiece. But I was disappointed; I felt like I hadn't been taken through the roller-coaster ride of emotions; laughs and thrills that I had been with Pulp Fiction, a few months prior. But looking back and after many further viewings, Reservoir Dogs has snuck up on me because I now value it a little higher than Pulp Fiction and bizarrely enough, I get more of an emotional kick out of this film then Tarantino's follow up.Perhaps it was my naivety in regards to independent film at the time that I didn't take to this after the first viewing, but any doubts towards this not being an excellent and spell-binding film have since been laid to rest. Reservoir Dogs is a film that delves into the past from the present, setting up several characters; situations and stories within flashbacks that all combine to deliver a hair-raising climax with plenty of other dramatic, some more gruesome than others, moments thrown in for good measure. Reservoir Dogs is at its very core, a brilliant and emotionally fuelled film that twists, turns, creates doubts and delivers on levels of artistic creativity, out and out action and stupendous dialogue without ever feeling like a gimmick.Some of my favourite scenes in the film rely on slow motion such as the German Shepard police dog barking in the cloakroom amongst the other officers and Cabot (Tierney) lighting up a cigarette as he gives his opinion on the false story, smoke flying up all around him as another voice-over kicks in. Then there are the scenes in the warehouse in which Steve Buscemi playing Mr. Pink and co-producer Harvey Keitel playing Mr. White deliver some fantastic performances aided with dialogue that sums up the situation, mentality and emotions running high given that scenario they find themselves in. But the film knows how to rope us in and juxtapose our feelings and emotions without ever feeling manipulative. Some examples of this is are at the very beginning when, after a quiet and relatively subtle breakfast conversation, Mr Orange (Roth) lies screaming and bloody in the back of a car <U+0096> something has gone wrong. There is also the incidence when Mr Blonde (Madsen), during that infamous 'ear' scene, leaves the action to go to his car in order to get a can of petrol. These juxtapositions and toying with the audience sums up not only the brilliance of being able to switch between scenarios but also highlights Tarantino's skill as a writer/director.The truth is that any scene that takes place in the warehouse rendez-vous is just pure genius, whether it is dialogue between two or three people or the torture scene or the unforgettable climax. A diamond robbery has gone wrong and the immediate theory of an undercover cop crops up thanks to the quick thinking of Mr. Pink; the more outgoing and independent of the thieves. But this seed planted in the audiences mind is one of a few things we are to concentrate on throughout the duration. Twinned this, we get numerous flashbacks and, indeed, flashbacks within flashbacks that tell us a greater deal of information involving the heist and the characters past situations. But here several things work at once: Nice Guy Eddie (Penn) arrives and maintains there is no 'rat', perhaps disbursing the theory of a traitor, challenging the audience to work it out. Mr. Blonde is established as someone who is just out of prison and his awkward situation involving parole officers and such doesn't faze him as he accepts the new job from his former employees of the heist. This creates a dangerous opinion of him in our minds, further emphasising the earlier opinion we had of him when it was established 'Blonde went crazy' and shot several people, including a young woman. It is an appetiser for what's to come, especially when he has a policeman at his mercy; but my favourite bit is when we learn he went to a drive-thru restaurant at a time of crisis and with a policeman in his boot.But these criminals in suits are not caricatures of mobsters from other crime/heist films. Mr. Orange screams and squeals in agony after being shot thus expelling any 'tough-guy' stereotype we may have of these guys in this genre. It is later established to great effect that he is a very humble and humane person, with bigger fish to fry. Tarantino executes a film here with random flashes of violence such as the torture scene climax and Mr. Pink's breakaway flashback. He lands his pop culture dialogue with talk of Madonna; The Silver Surfer and likens Gene Tierney to 'The Thing'. It even transpires some of the guys enjoy Lee Marvin's work. Shot on a budget with the help of Harvey Keitel but written with a budget of a lot less in mind, Reservoir Dogs shocks but entertains; humours but does not glamorise and generally gives its viewer a kick every time they watch it.


                
STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs A film telling the tale of the after-math of a botched bank raid by a gang of professional thieves. The rapid alert of the police and word-of-mouth has also drawn the conclusion of an undercover police officer in their midst.Upon it's initial release, this flick caused the biggest stir in movies since The Exorcist. A generally violent, foul-mouthed movie at the best of times featuring the notorious ear-cutting scene. Although having seen it, I can't really see what all the fuss was about. The camera veers away from that shot, whereas in Robocop you saw a man get blasted to bits by a gang of crooks with guns (as well as seeing him writhing in agony whilst they laugh at and taunt him!) and another scene where you see a man's testicles apparently get blown off after an attempted rape, yet to the best of my knowledge that was never banned, or even Candyman 2 where you actually see a man's hand being severed off with a rusty blade whilst similar taunting is going on which was never banned. I suppose the graphic, real shot of the man who's been shot in the stomach at the beginning might have played a big part too, though (in a way, it's certainly a lot more shocking than that scene.) But all that controversy aside, we are dealing with a truly legendary film here. A small, low-budget, art-house production that leaves you more fulfilled than any big-budget, Hollywood production ever could. There is a genuinely impressive, shining quality to the writing, dialogue and story-telling at play here that no doubt cemented Tarantino's ascension to his current glory. Moreover, you can see what are probably the earliest hatchings of the 'reverse-plotting' trend starting here that lead to such films as Memento getting made.All of the cast are excellent, and it can only be the work of the hands of fate that while some went on to really make names for themselves (Tarantino, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi) others (Michael Madsen, Chris Penn) just got delegated to either supporting roles or straight-to-video roles. I suppose if I had to pick particular favourites, they would be Buscemi as the edgy, mechanical brains of the group, and Madsen, who has a quiet, un-nerving edge to him that seems typical of a genuine psychopath.It is basically a film driven by dialogue and atmosphere, with a cracking soundtrack from artists as diverse as Steeler's Wheel to Dolly Parton. It's controversy may have given it a helping hand and the name 'Reservoir Dogs' is never actually explained, but for far better reasons than that, this is a film that deserves never to be forgotten. *****


                
Tarantino's first film is perhaps the best. The dialogue is just people talking about normal stuff like music, TV, movies and random stories. The action has a realistic brutality to it which causes audiences to cringe and it has the best soundtrack a film has ever had. The cast is the stuff of indie film legend. Keitel, Madsen, Buscemi and Roth. Madsen shines above all these others due to his performance and the actions of his character. This film has been called overly violent but I didn't find it shocking to watch, entertaining but I grew up on Braveheart, Terminator and Pulp Fiction, three films I saw before I saw 'Reservoir Dogs'. This film is truly great, an instant classic and a must see film.


                
Simply put, "Reservoir Dogs" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This 1992 predecessor to 1994's "Pulp Fiction" is truly in a class by itself.  This film has been a blueprint for basically every other wanna-be-like-Tarantino movie made in the last seven or so odd years.  The acting is truly superb.  Every one of the main characters turn in top-notch performances.  Harvey Keitel's turn as the o'er-the-hill criminal MR WHITE is perhaps his best ever.  Micheal Madsen's take as the psychopathic MR BLONDE is perhaps one of the most realistically frightening performances I've ever seen.  This was truly the role he was born to play.Rounding out the cast, you have the always enjoyable Steve Buscemi (MR PINK), Tarantino favorite Tim Roth (MR ORANGE), Tarantino favorite Quentin Tarantino (MR BROWN), Chris Penn as NICE GUY EDDIE and finally.....(whew)....Lawrence Tierney as the cranky mob boss JOE CABOT. The cast is utterly superb.One aspect of Tarantino's is his ability to say so much with so little.  Though the scene involving MR BLONDE'S shooting spree is never actually seen in the film, it is all too easy to picture Micheal Madsen in his JoeKool shtick, blasting holes into anything moving with eerie unemotional detachment.   Tarantino BUILDS his characters with amazing style. (see Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, etc...)  MR WHITE'S compassionate struggle to protect and save the life of MR ORANGE is gutwrenchingly moving. True "honor among thieves" type stuff here.All in all, this movie is a classic.  Be cool.....man.


                
"Reservoir Dogs" is the baptism by fire for Quentin Tarantino, an obscure actor who is at his first experience as a director. And let's say that, for a first time, Tarantino knows how to draw the attention.Released about 15 years ago, "Reservoir Dogs" is looked up today as a classic, just like the other subsequent Tarantino movies would be, should I say it."Reservoir Dogs" tells the story of a group of gangsters recruited by an eccentric, but serious boss, in order to rob diamonds from a jewelry store. The film shows the before the operation and the after. But not the during. There are indeed some clues which allow to build a script in our mind, but that's precisely what Tarantino wants: that the viewer let his imagination working.What's more, there is no straight line. The before and the after are alternated in such a random way that it becomes almost impossible to get all the scenes back in the actual order. The only thing we can know for sure is whether we're watching the before or the after. Generally, we can have a certain idea. But it would take several days of viewing and checking the scenes one by one in order to determinate where they go in the story's actual chronology.This strategy is reminiscent of older movies like "Citizen Kane" where we could see a young Orson Welles, then an old, younger, older<U+0085> We almost get lost.Anyway, whether it's the before or the after, one thing predominates throughout this movie: the politically incorrect. Some would say that Tarantino's trademark is the extreme and aesthetic violence, while others would say that it's his characters' monologues. But one thing unites each of these elements: they're all politically incorrect. And this is precisely Tarantino's real trademark: the politically incorrect.Tarantino fills his movie with violence at one point we could believe that he's compressing several war movies at the same time, so they could get the same size as only one. There's as much blood in "Reservoir Dogs" as in a Red Cross collecting center. But Tarantino can't get satisfied by only showing violence. He shows it in several ways.He can show violence in its most simple expression, like in the pursuits between the police officers and the gangsters or he can elaborate it. The most striking way is by turning on the radio. In this way, we can see the sadistic Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slice the ear of a police officer taken as an hostage while listening (and dancing) "Stuck in the Middle With You" from Stealer's Wheel. For baby-boomers, it's called nostalgic violence. It's horror and happiness. It's been rarely seen before.Another way, more expected, is black, even philosophical violence. Thus, we can see Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), completely beaten up, who still shoot on each other. Two gushing sponges who battle themselves till it's the end for both of them<U+0085> And the gun zigzag at the end. That's what we call a shooting line.From a philosophical point of view, we can add the monologues from the different characters as they chat about subjects like the real signification of the song "Like a Virgin" from Madonna (is it about dicks?) and why people should tip when they go to the restaurant.Each actor has his chance of having his own monologue or a long and endless scene where the importance of knowing his text by heart is primordial. If the actor bluffs, he has to shoot this endless scene all over again. But the director seems to trust his actors totally and he trusts their talents for such scenes.With its generous violence, its anti-heroes without honor, its numerous blasphemies, its macho and racist dialogs and its countless sexuality references, "Reservoir Dogs" truly is a pollution.But with its numerous references to old TV series and movies, music from the 70s and popular culture, "Reservoir Dogs" is also nostalgia.In the end, much like "Pulp Fiction", "Reservoir Dogs" can simply be summarized in two words: nostalgic pollution.
By owning this movie you own a little piece of movie history.The absolute most fantastic thing about "Reservoir Dogs" is the brilliant dialog. The movie is one big memorable quote and it alone makes the movie more then worth to watch.Another wonderful thing about the movie are the characters. Rarely has there ever been so many great, cool and memorable characters in one movie. Maybe it's because of the amazing cast, everyone is perfect in their role I'm not going to especially mention a few because I feel I then won't do enough credit to the others and credit they deserve!The story is told in an unique way by using flashbacks from how they all got the assignment for the mission and flashbacks from after the robbery, not shown in the right order. And it works wonderful! It's a shear pleasure to watch from beginning till end.The hand held camera work gives the movie an extra cool feeling, it might look a bit unprofessional but it's nothing more then a brilliant addition to an already brilliant movie. The nice and cool "Super sounds of the 70's" soundtrack also adds to this, especially the now world famous thanks to the movie "Little Green Bag" from the George Baker Selection.The movie is full with memorable moments such as the fantastic opening, the cop torture sequence and the Mexican stand-off at the end. But between all those scene's there are lot's of other moments which you will never forget.Brilliant movie. An absolute must see! 10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
