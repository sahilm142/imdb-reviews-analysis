 "Hello, I'm an artsy dark comedy"

 Completly unrealistic storyplots, extremly overrated

 Great acting in utter trash

 Overrated quirk-fest from playwright turned screenwriter, seeks redemption for vigilantes

 Indulgent, Afraid of Sentimentality

 2 Long Bored hours outside Hastings, East Sussex

 An attempt at replicating a Cohen brothers movie

 Unbelievable plot line and open ending was a let down

 You can't make a good movie with a bad script

 it stinks!!!!!

 Over Rated

 Too many barking cats! And I hoped to like the film.

 Dark, Yes - Comedy, Not So Much

 Quit Liking Bad Scripts

 In Bruges, MO

 Thank god there are other bad reviews

 Sophomoric and mindlessly vulgar film that falls flat as a "dry" murder mystery comedy

 Highly Overrated

 Frances was good , every other aspect was overrated.

 missouri.........

 Emperor's New Clothes syndrome

 Great Performances-Horrible Writing/Story

 Terrible and Unrealiic

 No deserved Oscars in this predictable, cartoonish movie

 Overrated.
