 Cockfights in space

 Great production values ... but drags in places

 Characters are very dramatic unlike the fun loving characters in the book

 Not sure yet...

 Very solid new Sci-Fi series.

 Good take on great fiction

 Elizabeth Mitchell?

 Series 1&2 very fast, tight, action packed. Series 3 changes 1/2 cast, slows right down.

 Mixed feelings here... Rating between 6 and 7.

 Starts off strong tanks in the third.

 SciFi has had its day...

 The best show Syfy ever had..

 Good Show, GoT's comparison ABSURD

 I rank it with Firefly
