 Strangely Enjoyable

 Sloppy clash of moods, but it's genuinely touching at times and certainly worth a watch

 Beautiful but bleak

 Woah

 Mary and Max

 Unique,sad and at times weird

 Long last the friendship

 A different animation...

 Mary and Max Review

 Interesting, dark, witty and depressing.

 chocolate hotdogs....

 Claymation fantasy, long distance pen pals.

 84 Charing Cross Road meets The PJs...

 Grungey odd-couple comedy/drama...but how true is it?

 Tragedy & Claymation do not mix well.

 Sweet and beautifully animated

 A sad and true account of how a rencontre fails
