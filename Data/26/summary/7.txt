 great visuals, good characters but not a great story.

 Visually innovative, but has a lack of focus and is overstuffed.

 Rock solid Spiderm-Man Movie with superb visuals

 "What would I do if I were me?"

 Style over substance.

 Refreshingly Unique

 I understand the hype and the movie is pretty good OVERALL

 Good!

 A little to much Hype

 Real and Objective Review

 High energy animation the mixes things up

 Where it belongs

 Fresh take on Spider-Man

 Overrated and overhyped

 Arachnophobia

 "The film was so good I didn't pick my nose"

 Web Of Parallel Lies.

 Nice casual movie

 I like it

 Your Average Neighborhood Spider-Man

 It always fits, eventually. (Copied from myself with permission)

 Action packed, lots of Spidy action

 Refreshingly Multicultural

 Thank Donald Glover

 Best Spider-Man movie since the original trilogy
