 Review for the third season (6/10)

 Season 2, how you broke my heart

 The world needs bad men...

 Dark and Mesmerizing Series!

 Very good show.

 THE best crime mystery show.

 This is not for someone who reads books with pictures

 The critics were way too hard on Season 2

 Truly a Good Show

 masterpiece

 Holy wow!

 Both Season 1 and 2....just brilliant, probably the best to be seen.

 Unexpectedly good character-driven show

 One of Hollywood's rare moments

 Season 1 was a masterpiece, but give season 2 time.

 The new best show on TV.

 Awed by the supreme talents in True Detective

 Acting superb; excellent directing

 Season 3 Masterpiece!

 True Detective season 1 is a novel masterpiece!

 Almost a perfect trilogy... ALMOST.
