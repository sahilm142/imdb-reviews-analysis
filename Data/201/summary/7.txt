 Outstanding!

 Good acting but generally overrated

 A great movie I can't recommend

 pretty good, not great

 A sour lesson

 This movie was not a sports movie.

 Best durn western of the year!...

 Technical issues are obstacle to greatness

 Probably wouldn't crack my top 50 of 2004

 Good

 Cringeworthy at times and brilliant at others

 Ponderous, not at all bad.

 Fine until insincere final reel

 realy good one.

 Hard hitting, emotionally wrenching

 A Million Dollar Experience

 Master class in drama

 Average people can do incredible things

 Excellent

 Good but it could have been better

 Million Dollar Baby: "I Don't Train Girls"

 It's so sad.....

 are you a boxing fan??

 Not a knockout but a solid effort

 Fine Movie
