Jemaine (Jemaine Clement) and Bret (Bret McKenzie) are struggling musicians from New Zealand trying to make it in New York City. The duo has a band called Flight of the Conchords. They're managed by incompetent Murray Hewitt (Rhys Darby) who has a day job in the New Zealand consulate. Mel (Kristen Schaal) is their number one fan and possibly their only fan. Their friend Dave Mohumbhai (Arj Barker) works at a pawn shop.The guys are doing a dead pan comedy duo. Bret is a bit flat although he's funnier in the second season. I think his character got dumber. I would like Jemaine to play up his jerky meanness. The funniest is Kristen Schaal although Rhys Darby is consistently fun. The show should have more Schaal. I can do with less of the comedic songs. It's fine when the comedy hits but it's not like it's good music. This is mostly a fun watch.


                
Somewhere, someone is trying to come up with an original show. I just hope they get to it soon. Flight of the Conchords is pretty much a copy of Tenacious D. Replace Jack Black and Kyle Gass with 2 guys from New Zealand, and Ta-Da. That's not to say it's not funny. The jokes are pretty good, and the songs make me laugh, but the show is pretty much the same format. All in all, "Flight of the Conchords" is pretty much the same show, but on the opposite end of the spectrum. It's a little less "Rock-and-Roll", and a little more New Zealand folk. Brit and Jermaine aren't as lively, and a little more "dry-wit" British humour then Jack and Kyle. The shows alright, but I hope they stop the 'D copy here and stay away from the Silver Screen.
