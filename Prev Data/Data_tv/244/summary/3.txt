 Turn the Paige

 Season 5 Boring

 Too overrated

 Great until now- Season Five

 could be...

 Overrated, dull, stereotypical and soapy.

 Wanted To Love It, Wanted To Like It

 stupid...

 Slowing to a Snails Pace

 Dull cold war,touchy,feely 'drama'

 Kerri does not know how to fake smoking

 Pretty Good But With Some Silly Bits
