Nathan for You is like watching The Profit except it takes out all of the seriousness and replaces it with laugh out loud comedy. The main character Nathan, goes from business to business with unexpected and clever ways in hopes of having the owners gain money and/or fame. He is not a stranger to making fun of the guests as well as himself. He puts on a creepy, awkward personality that fits in with the jokes he tells. I enjoy this program very much and am so happy it was recommended to me by YouTuber H3H3 Productions!
