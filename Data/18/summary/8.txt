 Guns. Leather. Keanu Reeves. How cool can it get?

 A Bit Confusing But A Big F/X Treat

 I think it was good

 A classic that still holds up.

 Highly overrated film

 A wild sci-fi classic.

 The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...

 Overrated, but still excellent entertainment

 Great Sci-Fi effects can create a classic

 A daytime computer programmer is recruited by mysterious group of people, because he could be "The One"

 Excellent movie

 Setting News Standards

 Good sci-fi movie

 Original and great, but with one important flaw

 Sometimes the truth is merely an illusion

 Life is about choices we make

 Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun

 Good movie!!!

 Stylish visuals, clever sci-fi and awesome action!

 Philosophical and artistic sci-fi!

 the special effects are spectacular

 "A deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix, when they change something"

 Interesting, well-delivered concept

 This will remain a classic, even in 20 years time.

 The Best Sci-Fi movie of the 90's---8/10
