 Solid performances and an astonishing third act make the pilot a winner

 Season 3

 Dark comedy at its finest

 Good series, trailed off a little at the end

 Fargo

 an absurdist & macabre western

 Great casting

 Fargo (Channel 4) – Review

 It's certainly not 'Fargo' (1996), but...

 Pastiche. But a forgivable one.

 Fargo Breaks Bad

 Dark comedy that is a crowd pleaser

 Season 3 was disappointing.

 Entertaining but a bit too convenient for its own good

 Season 1.... then 2

 Two hilarious lines from the new series, Fargo

 Good start with a couple of issues

 Intriguing series

 Fargo

 Season 1 - Fascinating Fiction with Some Glaring Flaws

 Pity you can't rate by season

 Superb

 Good show.
