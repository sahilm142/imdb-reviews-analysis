 Brilliant, quirky dark comedy with expert performance by Bryan Cranston...

 Fantastic show that killed my spirit.

 Splendid series about a chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer and his helper to ensure his family have a financial future create Methamphetamine

 Too much hype

 What's the big deal?

 Decent show about the increasingly poor decisions of Walter White

 "Breaking Bad" the most overrated TV series of all time.........

 Good, but rather overrated...

 Good but not a 9.5.

 Interesting series but gradually losing consistency

 Breaking Bad maybe probably the most overrated show ever

 Ridiculously overrated show

 i don't get the hype

 Starts of as the greatest action drama ever made. After a few seasons, not so much...

 Gradually climbing down the ladder of cinematic art for every Season

 Interesting, but not that above the curve

 Decent, but incredibly overrated

 A good show but not an iconic show.

 Surprisingly Good. Incredibly Annoying.

 A decent show but poor acting lets it down

 Breaking Bad goes bad just as it approaches the finish line.

 Pretty good

 Overrated

 Not Must See, but Good

 Too dark for my taste
