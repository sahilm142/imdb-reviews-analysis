 My favorite Anime

 Dear, Dear, anime fans who obsess over Naruto and Bleach-YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET

 The Greatest Anime Series I Have Seen

 Without a doubt one of the best anime series ever made

 The Godfather of anime

 Change "free time" to "time well spent".

 Very fine anime-MY FAVORITE!

 Possibly the best Anime I have ever seen

 FMA... best series ever??? maybe not... but Top Ten at least!

 Best anime out there.

 Absolutely Brilliant In Every Way

 Great show!

 My favorite show(some beginning spoilers)

 BEST BY FAR ( Prefer the Japanese version )

 Beautiful Series

 The best anime ever!

 A world where alchemy outstripped technology

 If you like to be surprise or like a very emotional story this is the greats anime you will ever see.

 Amazingly touching and detailed story about the mistakes the Elric brothers make, and their journey to fix them.

 A must see anime

 One of the best examples of balance

 Epic Anime

 Simply Beautiful!

 Despite being overshadowed by its more faithful sister series, the original FMA is one of the best anime series, PERIOD
