 brilliant concept

 Fantastic but not perfect

 Male, Female, and All Other Options, This Is for You!

 A Joyful Shinkai Film

 A beautiful and unique film

 Beautifully Detailed and Enjoyable for Non-Anime Fans

 They're no strangers, yet they've never met.

 Not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general, but I did like this film.

 I am confused

 Beautiful love story
