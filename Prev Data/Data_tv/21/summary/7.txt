 A miniseries that is - in my opinion - overrated.

 Highly entertaining, but not the best out there.

 Some bad, quite a lot of good

 That was fun

 Thousand curses to you FOX

 ..the 'Brown Coats'...

 Entertainng, Not life changing

 It kinda Grows On You

 Not Whedon's best, expectations were too high.

 Overrated but very good indeed

 An enjoyable watch but not Buffy

 So "The Earth got used up"

 Good show but my least favourite of all Joss' creations
