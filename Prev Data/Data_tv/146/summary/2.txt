 What?

 Again!?

 Pretentious and boring

 Should have been much better.

 Very disappointing - avoid at all costs.

 Not what I expected at all

 How the heck did this get 8,7 on IMDB? LACK OF DEPTH

 Plodding with saturated blacks and uninteresting characters

 The slowest time travelling show ever !

 Exciting concept, bogged down by melodrama

 Cliche with voice over
