 A bittersweet symphony of life and love

 crying on film

 A Universal Story

 Best silent film I ever saw

 Beautiful - I can't say it enough

 A great silent film with an artistic feel to it that many other silent films lack

 Sunrise is real scorcher of a film. It really does shine.

 Worth the watch

 okay story, unbelievable cinematography

 One of the Best films I've seen period...

 Performed at a pop festival

 90 Years Later, Sunrise Still Holds Up Really Well

 Love conquers all!

 Dated but historically and aesthetically interesting

 Sunrise indeed withstands the test of time

 great style and compelling story

 Stylistic Peak of the Silent Era

 An excellent precursor to several genres of film today.

 A Truly Great Silent Film

 Great cinematography

 Most beautiful silent movie ever!

 Silence is the best

 Sunrise
