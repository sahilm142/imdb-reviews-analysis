I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks!  True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable.  Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears.  It's perfect.  The end could not be better.  I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin.  I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way.  So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it.  It's very effective.  Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man.  He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope.  They all do so well.  They are believable characters.  Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development.  Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on!  She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!).  Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant.  It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius!  What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.Bravo!


                
My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.


                
Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.


                
Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.This is the best of the series & not just because of the victory over the Empire. It springs a surprise in Luke having a sister, & completes Luke confronting what is left of his father. It destroys an empire & an emperor. It introduces Ewoks & then has them join in an alliance to create the victory. It even makes C3PO a God, & you can't top that.While it does not have a miracle create the complete victory, like Ben Hur does with Christs Crucifixation & events erasing Ben Hur's mother & sisters Leprocey, it does create a man made miracle alliance which ultimately destroys the evil Empire. This really counts big in the scheme of things.There is an ultimate satisfaction in the victory, especially when everyone including Ben, & Darth seem to be a part of it. That is what makes this the ultimate celebration.
So the legendary original trilogy "Star Wars" came up to its logical end, for 6 years it excited the minds of the audience. Lucas and the company present to us the long-awaited finale, which will finally put all the points in the fates of the heroes and give us one of the most spectacular space battles between Good and Evil.This time, the little-known Richard Markwand sits in the director's chair. All of us favorite "father" STAR WARS George Lucas acted only as a screenwriter. For which it can be praised, because the script was very good, without long actions and dialogues, and most importantly-exciting.The Far-Far Galaxy becomes the battlefield between the Empire and the Rebels. The construction of the second Death Star is coming to an end, and anticipating an early attack of the rebels, the head of the evil galactic state Emperor Palpatine arrives at the station to watch the battle, arrogantly hoping for the victory of the imperial forces. Meanwhile, the drama continues to develop between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The former farm boy knew the Force and now he is waiting for the final fight with Lord Sith. Luke believes that there is still good in him and that there is still a chance for salvation.In addition to meeting with Vader Luke, in the company of his friends: Leah, Chewbacca and the droids R2D2 and C3PO saves Han Solo from the slippery claws of the gangster Jabba the Hutt. And soon the main characters are reunited with the forces of the Rebellion to prepare for the final battle.Actor's game, once again, you can praise. Mark Hammil again shone. The tension he felt, fighting inside himself with anger, spurred by the Emperor, was transmitted from the screen and made him feel empathic with the protagonist. Carrie Fisher, this time, supplemented her game with a beautiful figure, so often flashed at the beginning of the picture. Harrison Ford once again proved that he is an excellent actor who does not give up his position. I would especially like to note Ian McDiarmid. The image of the Emperor was excellent. How much evil, arrogance, excessive pride. This actor played Palpatine just as well in the prequel trilogy.Visual effects, as it should for STAR WARS, are performed at the highest level of quality. The abundance of space battles, fights on lightsabers, technology - all this due to high quality becomes a matter of good nostalgia. I really liked the new characters - Ewoks, little bear cubs-aborigines of the green planet Endor, on whose orbit the "Death Star" was built.I want to say a big thank you to John Williams for the fact that this magnificent composer rejoiced with his delightful melodies throughout all the sagas, both original and prequel trilogy.The picture has once again proved that, no matter how gloomy and dark the world is, even the slightest ray of light can illuminate this world.George, along with Richard, completed the saga dignifiedly, in a big way. But, as we know, Lucas's imagination is unlimited and the departure to the history of the Star Wars has been postponed, since 16 years later a new episode appeared - "The Hidden Menace", which marked the return of the phenomenon to the screens.


                
The Return of the Jedi was George Lucas's last Star Wars film for 16 years, until he followed it up with the disappointing prequel The Phantom Menace in 1999. At the time that I am writing this review, Episode II has come out and proved that George Lucas is still able to produce an action packed space adventure (although he also proves that he is relying far too much on computer generated effects), and we are eagerly awaiting the release of Episode III in 2005, the film which has more possibilities than any of the Star Wars films since the original in 1977. The Return of the Jedi is the film in which we are introduced to the hideous Jabba the Hutt for the first time, as well as a score of other repugnant creatures. When I first watched this film, the first thing that struck me was an enormous increase in the level of gruesomeness that is seen in the creatures in the film. In the first film, even the antagonist creatures were at least mildly pleasant, but now we see Jabba, we see Jabba's disgusting sidekick with the snake things growing out of his head and around his neck, that tooth-riddled pit in the ground, as well as scores of other sickening things. We also get to the first glimpses of the badly damaged Death Star, whose post-explosive appearance is probably even more famous as an image in film history than its original appearance.  The Death Star is the focus of much of the conflict in the film. The Rebellion is making an elaborate attempt to destroy the Death Star, a nearly impossible excursion that involves timing an attack perfectly so that star-fighters can make an internal attack on the Death Star at just the right moment that their rebel partners are on a nearby planet, shutting down the defense mechanism that the Death Star is deriving from it. Clearly, this is not going to be an easy thing to do, and the majority of the film presents the efforts to get all of the forces coordinated to pull this task off, with the ultimate climax occurring as the rebel attack coincides with the revelation that the Death Star is fully functional as a weapon despite massive damage (a little secret they have tactfully decided not to reveal), and that they are already aware of the impending attack and more than capable of squishing all of the attackers like a lot of space-bugs. 
Great story, I think. And it's a good thing, too, because there were at least a few other things that I was less than impressed with about this particular installment in the Star Wars saga. The Ewoks, for example, just didn't strike me as something that belonged in a Star Wars film. I am more than willing to accept them, if for no other reason than the fact that they are now one of the more recognizable things from the old Star Wars films (although it seems like there are thousands of recognizable things from the old Star Wars films), but there were several battle scenes that failed to generate much excitement due to all of the cuddly little snuggle bears running around. Besides that, the Ewok costumes were some of the least impressive outfits in any Star Wars film to this day. You could almost see the seams along the sides, the faces were about as realistic as any stuffed animal, and the pads of the feet, which occasionally were in view, were just as toy-like. They were little more than cheap Halloween costumes.
On the other hand, the rest of the film is so entertaining that I am willing to forgive things like this. It's 1983, for crying out loud, so I'm not about to downgrade the movie for something like that, even though both of its predecessors had universally better costumes despite being older films. It's clear throughout the film that we are watching the conclusion of the conflict between the Imperial Forces and the Rebellion that we saw develop in the last two films, which is why it does not quite reach the same level of stupendous excitement and entertainment of them. There are a lot of fascinating characters and creatures introduced here, and some of the battles scenes in space far surpass anything in Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, but despite the fascinating story, there is just too much an element of conclusion and tying up loose ends for this movie to be as fresh and exhilarating. There is great concern in the last act of the movie with the metaphorical presentation of the dark side and the, well, the light side, I guess. Maybe the bright side? Yeah, the bright side, that sounds better. The dark side and the bright side. Luke is being held captive by Darth Vader and the Emperor and being forced to watch his friends careen helplessly into a battle, unaware that they have no chance of winning. As this happens, we are just itching to see Luke go for that light saber and strike someone down with it and do something heroic, but then the Emperor starts trying to convince him to do this. He encourages Luke to give in to his anger and officially become part of the dark side. It's easy to see how Vader was seduced by the dark side, if all it takes is the killing of someone that you bitterly hate because they are forcing you to watch the deaths of your friends. Throughout the entire Star Wars saga, one of the things that I always wondered about was how exactly Vader was seduced by the dark side, and in this scene I found myself seduced by it because I so badly wanted to see Luke do exactly what the Emperor was asking him to do. 
Clearly, the story of The Return of the Jedi leaves very little to be desired, with the exciting battles that come from the struggle between the Rebels and the Empire, and with Luke's struggles against the dark side as well as his interaction with Vader as Vader lay dying in his arms (another heavily metaphorical representation of the dark and bright sides). And despite a few elements of the film that prevent it from really rising to the level of quality and pure entertainment that it could have risen to, this is a powerful installment in the Star Wars saga. Given the relatively cheesy end that we saw in this film, with all of our heroes partying and hugging at an Ewok party in the woods (and with Luke giving the stereotypical grin to the ghostly images of Obi Wan and Yoda and the image of his father before he became Darth Vader (?)), I am curious about the future of the Star Wars saga. I've heard rumors about the production of Episodes VII, VIII, and IX, which seem a little far-fetched at this point, but it also seems almost as far-fetched that old George would end one of the greatest film sagas of all time with the closing scene of The Return of the Jedi.


                
"Return of the Jedi" is almost on par with the previous "Star Wars" films. There's more special effects (some good, some cheesy) and more new characters and creatures, including the Ewoks.  What makes Jedi the least perfect, is that it's very routine -- more of a reworking of "Star Wars." There's more new surprises, though.  A victory is celebrated at the end.  New scenes are featured in the "special edition." The ending is very satisfying.  My evaluation: ***1/2 out of ****.


                
Some people have disliked this film, and I truly don't see why. "Return of the Jedi," does not, contrary to popular opinion, ruin the original "Star Wars" trilogy but rather ties it up in a perfectly satisfying way. The opening scenes at Jabba the Hutt's palace are well done. Jabba is a much meaner and scarier villain here than the short clip in the 1997 re-release of "A New Hope" showed him to be. Luke Skywalker is forced to make his most difficult choices in this film, and the intensity of the film's last half-hour is some of the most compelling film-making I've ever seen. The themes and messages of redemption and good vs. evil are superbly done here. "Return of the Jedi" is a very exciting and engaging film, memorable and worth watching many times, especially now that Episode III has been made. It's not as perfect as the previous two Star Wars films were, but it is a very pleasing and happy conclusion to an amazing story. The fourth best in the saga, behind the two originals and Episode III. Nearly perfect.***1/2 out of ****


                
Quite an amazing ending to the original trilogy. Little did I know when I was 9 years old watching this that this was not the ending to STAR WARS, but rather a door was open to create another 9 movies to date. This was my favourite film for a time being until I fell in love with another George Lucas creation in Indiana Jones.The group of rebels including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) to name a few are now off to the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt's palace. The bounty hunter Boba Fett has brought him his new prized possession in Han Solo (Harrison Ford) frozen in carbonite. Meanwhile, the Empire is recreating the Death Star and yep she is fully operational. So Luke must turn and face Darth Vader to complete his Jedi training and also save the universe.I truly love the first 45 minutes or so of this film and really to me out does the amazing battle on the ice planet of Hoth from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. It really is an amazing way to open up a film. Quite action-packed. While there really are no boring moments in the rest of the film at times in a couple scenes it does seem to become dialogue heavy while there is very little visually going on. A very minor problem though, as it doesn't lessen the film really. Written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas with excellent score by John Williams.There are a couple scenes that were changed in 1997 that personally I prefer the original. First being a scene in Jabba's palace when in 1997 they added a couple very-CGI characters that sing a silly song. In this version it seems that the movie stops so it can go into a musical number. The second being the very end of the film. Even though the music in both versions are similar, I seemed to love the music from the original 1983 release. While the 1997 release added footage making it seem more universal.So, if you did enjoy the first two you must watch this one. You will likely enjoy just as much as the other two.


                
Unfortunately, this movie has a bad reputation because of the Ewoks. The fans need to let that go. Sure it wasn't the best idea, but it certainly wasn't the worst idea. I'm probably letting nostalgia get in the way, but the Ewoks never bothered me. I can see why people don't like them, and I know that the idea of teddy bears using bolas and sticks to defeat highly trained soldiers is ridiculous. But hey, at least it wasn't Jar Jar and I'll take the Ewoks over Jar-Jar any day of the week. All in all, I love Return of the Jedi just like I love the other two films in the trilogy.Story: After rescuing Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt, Luke Skywalker and Leia rejoin the Rebel Alliance to destroy the 2nd Death Star while Luke prepares for his final challenge to confront his father, Darth Vader and the Emperor.What makes this movie great? Like I said in my review of the first Star Wars movie: the characters and the story are the main focus and not the spectacle. The acting once again delivers 100% with Mark Hamill giving in my opinion probably his best performance as Luke Skywalker in the entire trilogy. Luke has matured at this point in the trilogy, more patient and the scene where he first uses his new green light saber at the Sarlaac pit is so awesome. Harrison Ford once again is great as Han Solo with the character being more mature in this one than the first two outings. Carrie Fisher once again is great, and I remember the first time I was watching this and the revelation of Leia being Luke's sister really surprised me. Billy Dee Williams once again brings his own charm as Lando, and Ian McDiarmid is really great at playing Emperor Palpatine.There are so many other things that work in this movie: the Sarlaac Pit sequence, Yoda telling Luke there is another Skywalker which Luke learns through the spirit of Obi Wan that it's Leia, the speeder bike chase on Endor and the space battle where Lando destroys the 2nd Death Star. But most of all the final confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader with the Emperor relentlessly taunting Luke with lines such as "Use your aggressive feelings boy! Let the hate flow through you!" Luke of course has learned to use the discipline that he learned from Yoda and Obi Wan and not give in, and tries to get Darth Vader to come back from the dark side. But Luke nearly falls into the dark side when Darth Vader threatens to turn Leia to the dark side and Luke loses it and cuts off Vader's hand. Luke stops himself and refuses to give into the dark side, and the Emperor responds by shooting lighting out of his hands at Luke. Then comes in probably my favorite scene in the entire movie: while the Emperor is electrocuting Luke, the camera pans up to Darth Vader's mask showing Vader looking back to the Emperor and back to Luke, and all of a sudden he lifts the Emperor and throws him down the reactor pit and the Emperor dies. The reason why I love this part so much is that the way the camera focuses on Darth Vader with the music playing in the background, the audience gets the impression that Vader's conflicted and then without saying a word, he decides that he will not let Palpatine kill his son, and is redeemed (Whatever you say, don't even get me started about the change George Lucas made in this scene). I have to admit, the scene where Luke removes Vader's mask gets me a bit emotional, especially when Vader says "You were right about me".Watching this again recently made me realize how great and underrated this movie is despite the common complaint about the Ewoks. Again, the Ewoks don't really bother me and the Yub Nub song (the one before came another change I'd rather not talk about) makes me feel like a little kid again. This film works terrifically as the final chapter in the original trilogy with the character arcs ending on a positive note for the main characters and all is right with the galaxy. "Return of the Jedi", along with the other two will always have a special place in my heart. This set of movies shaped my life in so many ways and gave me so many great experiences with my friends who also loved Star Wars, and my Dad who saw them in theaters back in the 70's and 80's and even my Mom (though she isn't really into Star Wars, even after she watched them with me. But it was worth a try). Regardless of how much hate George Lucas gets these days because of the prequels and "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", people need to watch this and the other two original films again to be reminded of how great a saga George Lucas gave to the world. This is in my opinion one of the best conclusions in any trilogy, and like I said about the Ewoks, the fans need to let that go. In light of the recent news of Episode 7 currently in the works, let's hope whoever decides to direct the new trilogy in the future can bring back the spirit of Star Wars that was missing from the prequel trilogy.
The finale of the original Star Wars trilogy!! The entire cast returns for a thrilling installment I must say. Mark Hamill is Luke once more and he looks bad ass in the all black Jedi outfit. Especially with the new green light saber, yes!!!! Chewbacca even gets a new hairdo, which I prefer over the 'greased' back look. But now let's get serious. The opening scene on Tatooine is great to say the least and Jabba's palace is excellent. When Luke enters it gets only better, the dark and mysterious entrance being great. Now a true Jedi, Skywalker has no need for a blaster and simply uses the force to silence his foes....PERFECT!!! The Rancor was a nice monster but the next scene is even better at the pit of 'Sarlac' where Luke nearly single handily defeats Jabba and co. The action here was great, Lando (Billy Dee Williams) having a bigger role in this film and I like his performance. Boba Fett seems to die, but if you're a fan ( a FAN- FAN) you know this isn't so.Any who, Luke visits Yoda on Dagobah for the last time and it is a sad moment. We learn Liea is actually Luke's sister so in the end it's a good thing they didn't get together (lol). Would've been kind of awkward if they had. Apparently the Empire has a new Death Star under construction and the Rebel Alliance mobilizes immediately to try and take it down before its completion. It is here my opinions jumble a bit...The Barc Speeder sequences are just incredible, my second favorite action scene in the film. The SFX here were simply amazing. Sigh, then the Ewoks arrive.. The admittedly cute little teddy bears totally backlash on the film's darker story. They somehow not only stand a chance but actually defeat the Imperial forces with minimal casualties, despite using rocks and trip wires! The tone is nearly ruined here thanks to the annoying Ewoks. At the same time, we have THE GREATEST LIGHT SABER DUEL EVER going on!!!!! Luke finally gives into his rage and attacks the Emperor, only to have to confront his father, Vader. This leads to one of the greatest duels in Star Wars history! It's emotional and cleverly choreographed and the music by John Williams is probably the darkest and one of his best pieces EVER!!!! Luke defeats Vader in a fit of rage, an excellent performance no doubt and the music continues to be no less than stunning. Darth Sidious, aka the Emperor, now prepares to kill Luke for his "lack of vision" (my favorite quote of his) and the all the emotional turmoil finally ends as Darth Vader himself destroys his Master. We see his sacrifice and now realize he is no longer Darth Vader but once more Anakin Skywalker, and I just loved that part of the story. The music really embraced this moment and it all seems to be one of the greatest movie moments ever, until we see the Ewoks celebrating...damn!!! In conclusion, Episode VI is still emotionally powerful, has great action and compelling music, but the Ewoks still take a star off. 9 out of 10, not so bad.
I know this is the lowest on the top 250 films of Star Wars, but this was a film I enjoyed even more than the first two. It has a very powerful ending with answers that you have been searching for since the first Star Wars.9/10


                
This is in my top 3 favorite movies, and i think it is the best star wars movie that George made.The movie is like the movies in one, it has a beginning then a middle part and a end part that comes together in one movie.I love how this movie is the first star wars to use a lot of lightsaber, and have the great scenes on the planets and a lot less space.George Lucas out did himself with return of the Jedi, and this movie even has my favorite lightsaber fight out of the entire series.This movie has been my favorite star wars since i was a kid, and i always think people underrate it as not being as good as the empire strikes back.This is the best scifi movie i have ever seen, and one of the best movies i have ever seen period, with all of the great things this movie is i say watch it.Star Wars is my favorite movies, and i think this one is the star wars to really watch and may the force be with you.


                
This movie exceeded all expectations, one of the best films in the saga and one of the best movies ever. With good actors (like Mark Hamil, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher); It also has a great soundtrack and other special effects. I just do not give 10 stars, because I found the end quite weak. Highly recommend.


                
One of the best star wars movies in my opinion, I always loved the ending and how Vader did what he did.


                
Fast, fun and freakin' awesome! The third film in the original Star Wars trilogy is definitely a step down from its predecessor, but is no a doubt a fitting, satisfying conclusion to the legendary original Star Wars trilogy!The themes from the last two films are here and are very rich! The action is fun and fast-paced, the dramatic stuff is moving and the Ewoks, who get waaaaay too much hate, are awesome!!! If you haven't seen Return of the Jedi, you simply must...especially if you've just watched the first two entrees. The Force will be with you...always!


                
Return of the Jedi is a nice conclusion to the original trilogy and it is very entertaining and has some of the best moments of the franchise.However the issues are very obvious, the Ewoks and everything surrounding them. They aren't bad but they are definitely weak when compared to everything else in the film. I could have ignored them but the Ewoks subplot in this film is quite sizeable and takes up a lot of the runtime.Now the negatives are out of the way, Return of the Jedi has lots of things to love. There is the great opening where Han gets rescued from Jabba the Hutt, the speeder bike chase, the amazing Darth Vader/Luke/Emperor fight sequence and the ending.Overall, this film is very good but doesn't quite compare to Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. Some things can feel a bit rushed at times due to the Ewoks subplot taking up more than enough runtime but other than that, this film is great.
Best Star Wars movie ever. Watch this movie before you die.


                
Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe third installment in the Star Wars series is the weakest. The film takes a lighter tone and this is its downfall. The story is still very complex and the characters are amazing yet the film has a light tone. The ending is good and the introduction to Yoda is amazing. I am not a big fan of the Ewok scenes only because it feels cheesy.The acting is very good. All the actors in the film perform very well.The pacing is perfect but the runtime is overlong.The special effects are once again amazing, the music is wondrous, and the sound effects are perfect.Even though this film has its flaws, it should be seen by all Star Wars fansPros: Complex story, amazing characters, great special effects, wondrous music, perfect sound effects, great acting, a good ending, and good pacingCons: The light tone is bad, an overlong runtime, the film is a little childish, and the Ewok scenes are cheesyOverall Rating: 8.7


                
This movie is up there as probably my number one star wars movie it changes with episode 3 Revenge of The Sith, yes a prequel, now for this movie people complain because of one simple thing the little teddy bears, but if you really think about it how long are they actually in the move? they are there for 1 battle and a celebration, rogue one has very small creatures running around with blasters and that ,movie is praised highly why only difference is one uses more practical objects to defend themselves, also it has one of the the best light saber fights as you can see that neither wish to fight but to influence the other to their side, very emotional film.everyone says tat empire strikes back is the best because of how dark and how cool the Hoth battle is but come on, not every movie has to be dark and mysterious to be a hit, movies can be very good oriented and have a happy ending and still be a spectacle.
Another superb movie from the original Star Wars trilogy.I watched this thinking it must surely fall short of the brilliance of the first two movies, but it most certainly did not.It introduces yet more weird and wonderful iconic aliens into the mix - most notably the grotesque Jabba the Hut and the adorable Ewoks.It matches the other movies for thrilling set piece battle scenes, culminating in the excellent space battle between rebel forces and the Imperial Destroyers and Death Star.Best of all, it delivers superbly on the ever evolving relationship between Luke, Darth Vader and the Emperor. The scenes toward the end where the Emperor tries to persuade Luke to turn to the dark side, and Luke simultaneously tries to get Vader to turn back, are deftly managed and quite terrifying.Oh, and we're treated with all the usual delightful characters of Leia, Solo, C3PO, R2-D2 et al.The only time the movie does show its age is in some of the initial scenes where alien monsters are shown using unconvincing stop-motion techniques. Fortunately there's less of these as the movie goes on.Return of the Jedi is yet another piece of brilliance from the Star Wars franchise.
I love the entire original "Star Wars" trilogy and I grew up watching them. And as a child I did like the ewoks a lot. But now having grown up I find it way too much that the military-trained forces of the Galactic Empire were bested by the primitive ewoks.The whole segment with Tattooine and the events with and around Jabba the Hutt were great. Although I always found Boba Fett's fate to be very anti-climatic.Story-wise then "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" is good fun and wholesome entertaining. The love romance between Han Solo and Leia Organa comes to a good conclusion, and Luke Skywalker's journey to become a jedi knight also holds some good events and surprises.The cast in "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" did great jobs, as they had been doing since episode IV."Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" has lots of great creature designs, vehicles, spaceships, characters and atmosphere. All in the spirit of the "Star Wars" universe.I am rating "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" nine out of ten stars, since the ewoks (despite their cuddly cuteness) does bring something silly and childish to the movie. And the movie had fared better without the teddybears.


                
Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi concludes the stories of the galaxy's greatest feat. This franchise is now owned by Disney, a 7th installment is scheduled for 2015. It should be bad I think. Anyway this review is centering on the 6th film of the series and possibly my second favorite. In 1983 when this film came out it was quite a loud, but sort of quiet film. There was no where near as much roar than there was for Episode 4 or 5. But George Lucas had to write it one way or another. And so it was settled that the 6th installment was going to be released. I like this film a lot, especially the ending. I think this was a great film because of the desperation put into it. Not many sequels live up to the original but this one did. This was maybe the final good sequel the 80s and 90s would ever see. I thank the makers of this film for all their desperate work and astonishing special effects. Without Star Wars, the world as we know it today would be the same but not in every pop cultural aspect.
I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies.But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's evil) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.Some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.


                
'Return Of The Jedi' is a bit like a kid who grows up to be a successful neurosurgeon only to stand in the shadows of two older siblings; one who landed on Mars and the other who became President... we're talking like Abraham Lincoln, not Chester A. Arthur. It's a cruel fate, really, as such a child might ultimately have been better off being born in a family where they're the first to get their high school diploma (GED, of course). In the land of the blind,... but I digress.There are flaws here, and they've been dissected ad nauseam for over thirty years now (Ewoks, burp jokes, Ewoks, rehashed plot devices, Ewoks, the dumbing down of Han Solo, Ewoks). I have nothing fresh to add to this, but suffice it to say, none of them is fatal. Third acts are notoriously difficult, and 'Return Of The Jedi' had more challenges than most thanks to its predecessor's leftover story baggage. The entire first act is spent tying up loose ends. By my math, that only leaves 2/3 of its runtime to, I don't know, wrap up the definitive work of cinematic mythology of the late 20th century. No small task, that. But it does it, and in grand, rousing fashion. And, at a time in the story when you don't really expect any twists, we get perhaps the biggest of all; the redemption of Darth Vader.People talk about Vader's reveal in 'The Empire Strikes Back' as one of the greatest shockers in movie history, and it is, but I contend that his redemption is at least as shocking. You have to remember, this was Vader when he was the icon of evil, before the prequel trilogy (clumsily in my opinion) humanized him. To think in 1983 that Vader would ultimately come back to the light after what we'd witnessed in the previous two films... not many saw that coming.'Return Of The Jedi' stumbles, it even falls, but it keeps getting back up on its feet and races to a thrilling climax that puts a triumphant exclamation point on the saga... or so we thought.
