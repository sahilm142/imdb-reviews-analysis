 Just as good, but harder to watch (emotionally)

 Gets better each episode

 Not as good as the prequel, but still the best Animation in awhile

 Excellent but a little rushed

 Wow

 A show about big ideas

 Don't Let The Ratings Mislead You! At The End of this Series, I'd Say Korra is Almost A Great as The ATLA

 While not reaching the heights of it's predecessor, TLOK is an amazing series in its own right.

 The second-best cartoon IMO

 Paving its own way while honoring the previous series

 Fantastic show, although deeper than TLA

 Great anime series

 Simply Marvellous....Loved it...

 Phenomenal series not given the credit deserved

 Magnificent, beautiful, superbly written and thankfully isn't a copy of its predecessor

 Our New Avatar

 One of my favorite shows!

 I hate to admit it, but...

 For the amount of episodes given...

 Pretty much perfect

 Surprised and happy to see

 One thing that does not give me rest ...

 Action packed and full of suspense!

 Legend of Korra is a great animation!!! YOU SHOULD WATCH IT!!!
