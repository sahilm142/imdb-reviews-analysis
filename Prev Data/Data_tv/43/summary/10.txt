 The smartest thing Fox has done yet

 UNparalleled

 It's all about the original run

 Putting the "vision" in television.....

 Hilarious and well-executed show.

 Funniest Show in Television- Brilliant!!

 The best show, for the most part

 writing as complex as DNA

 The Greatest Comedy on TV "nobody" saw

 Could Well Lay Claims To Being the Greatest Comedy Series Ever Made

 Brilliant Comedy.

 Comedy Gold.

 Cancellation the worst decision FOX made

 really is as good as everyone says

 A bright light went out the day this one was cancelled...

 Best Comedy of ALL TIME

 Incredibly hilarious, clever and original comedy (just ignore Season 4)

 Loved it! A great come back from an original series.

 People Suck. This Show Doesn't.

 4th Season BETTER than the Original Series

 Please do a 4th Season

 The weird thing about Arrested Development

 At it's best the funniest TV Show in Decades, at it's worst one of the funniest TV shows in decades

 You should be arrested if you haven't seen it yet !

 A sad day for humanity when it was cancelled
