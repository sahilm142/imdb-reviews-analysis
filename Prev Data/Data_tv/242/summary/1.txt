 Complete Waste Of Time

 Worst show Ever !!

 Fringe Fails in every category

 Bad show

 Worst Science Fiction Show ever

 Fringe is Cringe.

 Just stick to Lost JJ. Too much mystery BS now.

 Another J.J. Abrams Snoozefest

 As Boring As Expected

 Initial disappointment followed by continued disappointment

 Horrible!

 So far, so bad.

 Disappointing X Files Imitator

 God-Awful Show

 X-Files<U+0099> copy & paste

 Interesting but flawed.

 JJ Abrams - bad writer !!!!1

 Horribly cheesy, baseless assumptions

 more like cringe

 Waste of time.

 An alternate future, bl-eh, too bad they ruined this great show!
