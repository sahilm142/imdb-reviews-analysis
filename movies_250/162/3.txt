A surprise hit of the year, and completely undeserving attention at that. The plot of this slow-building horror-noir, heavily drawing on cult classics like the certain 1980 movie directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick, is not without merits, courtesy of a poignant treatment of a disturbed, misunderstood child prodigy. The supernatural elements of the film, on the other hand are contrived to such extremes that they are not believable at all and lack the power to truly frighten. Bruce Willis, as the child psychologist with a tough case and an unhappy marriage, should be given proper credit for restrained, realistic acting. But neither he, nor his gifted young patient can fix the holes in the scenery, which, if properly scrutinized, will reveal inexcusable and ludicrous inconsistencies. The consistently solemn, dour tone set to painfully conventional "gloomy suspense" music, does not improve the picture either; and the so-called "surprise ending" which everyone seems to be so fascinated with, makes VERY LITTLE SENSE if given sufficient thought.


                
big time spoiler alerts so go away if you haven't seen the movie yet. or even if you have and enjoyed it. plot holes always ruin it for me. plot holes, like bad math. very simple math. if it doesn't add up, its wrong. if the equation is long enough with more digits than able to easily keep track of, then the mistakes are more easily missed. this guy shammer the scammer is bad at math and is only good enough at slight of hand to pick your pocket and run away with your money. i love a good magic trick where i know I'm being fooled but i cant ever see how. but picking my pocket, i know you fooled me but only long enough for me to look the other way in trust you are entertaining me, not picking my pocket. Bruce dies, in the beginning, but we are not 'officially' told this until the supposedly twist ending, and then becomes a friend of a kid who sees dead people. but the red hearings we keep seeing to keep us from this twisted are misleading and in the end, i felt betrayed. the kids sees dead people, Bruce is dead. all the other dead people's wounds can be seen, not Bruce's. not until the end. misleading. all the scenes where the kid starts talking to Bruce, he is supposed to be interacting with the kid's mom or others and such. its supposed to be cool that he isn't really and we are not supposed to notice that. so in the end, we are only tricked into thinking this. but as the rest of the dead people are replaying out what was their life before they died or how they died. Bruce is on an unknown to him mission. very good idea if properly written into the movie. but what ruins it is the kid must know Bruce is dead and says nothing about it. all the rest of the dead people scare the crap out of this kid, but not dead Bruce. and then why does Bruce not realize no one else but the kid is answering him? the unknown mission is to save the second daughter from being poisoned to death by her mom. again, the kid is scared of the ghost girl first daughter while she leads him to the video she made of mom poisoning her. OK, cool, but why didn't she run away instead? but that whole bit seemed so out of place with the rest of the movie even if you did know the twist. why not have the twist realized before this part and then realize that's why Bruce is stuck haunting this kid to finish this mission. otherwise, how did Bruce and the kid really find out about Munchhausen mom? how is it not better to have a tighter better written script with the same twists?
The Sixth Sense is an average film with an excellent gimmick ending.  I enjoyed watching the film quite a bit, and the ending came out of nowhere and really blew me away, however, in retrospect, and upon my second viewing, the film did not.  It emerges as a slow moving film with a few high points and several lows, Bruce Willis acts tired and the lazy screenplay relies too much on its over confident ending.  Don't get me wrong, The Sixth Sense is a good film, but not a great one by any means, and has no right to be regarded as a horror masterpiece, that is just absurd.  Check out Kevin Bacon's Stir of Echoes, a similar films executed much better.


                
This is my friend Emma's review!'The film starts off with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) getting drunk as a celebration of Malcolm's honour plaque given to him by the Government/Council. After running upstairs, ready to jump into bed together, they hear a noise in the bathroom. It turns out a mental ex-patient of Malcolm's has broken in ("Vincent Gray"), and in the end of the scene Malcolm is shot by him, but the audience don't know yet that he is, in fact, dead.The first plot hole my friend and I came across was the notes Malcolm has on Cole Sear, his new client. How did he get the notes? We don't know. As it turns out in the very end, Malcolm has been dead the entire time, so he finds out for himself then why nobody has spoken to him for such a long time (yet another plot hole, because you WOULD notice that). You can rule out the idea that 'Coles mother filled Malcolm in with all the details' because Malcolm is dead and nobody can see him. A ridiculous detail I found out was that Bruce Willis had to write with his right hand in this film (he is naturally left-handed) to hide the fact he is not wearing his wedding ring since his death in the first scene. Plot hole number three comes up soon after, when we find Malcolm and Cole's mother sitting opposite one another in chairs in the Sear's resident lounge. I started to wonder; how did the very-dead-and-invisible Malcolm actually get into the house in the first place? Did he simply knock on the door and dart in as a confused Mrs Sear opens the door to an empty space? That, of course, would be ridiculous. So we are left wondering how the Hell he got in. Anyway, it is "cleverly designed" to make it look like Mrs Sear was speaking to Malcolm before Cole enters the house, returning home from school. Of course, when you figure out he's dead, you end up thinking how stupid that technique was because it was pointless and confusing, NOT a 'twist' in the plot. Later on in the film, a few scenes later, there is the scene where Malcolm is supposedly 'unravelling the secret' Cole has about his sixth sense, seeing dead people. The scene is where Malcolm is listening to a recording of himself and Vincent years ago in one of the counselling sessions. This scene soon gets on your nerves as all you can see is a confused Malcolm with a ridiculous expression on his face listening to what sounds like an out of tune radio. Yes, spooky, Shymalan. Apparently, from the "information" Malcolm gets from this event, he "figures out" that Cole has a similar condition as Vincent did. Diddy-Mao, Malcolm, we already figured that out for ourselves scenes ago! Now would be an opportune moment to mention that the actor that played Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is incredibly irritating throughout the film. He gives off that 'theatre-brat' attitude that makes you not want to give him any sympathy for his issues, but instead put him in a cage and throw away the key.After a scene where a pathetic Malcolm tells Cole of his "explanation" regarding the ghosts Cole sees, that the ghosts are actually wanting to have Cole's help, they summon up this idea for Cole that he should indeed help the people he sees. The acting is, again, ridiculous and melodramatic as Cole sees more hanging dead people.Plot hole number 5 occurs when Malcolm visits Cole in his school play. Why didn't anybody sit on him? He's not there, after all.In the next scene or so, Malcolm returns to his home, where he finds his wife asleep on the couch with the couple's wedding video on in the background. As she sleeps, Anna's hand releases Malcolm's wedding ring, which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing. Ding, ding, ding! Plot hole number 6! A shocked Malcolm has only JUST realised he hasn't been wearing his wedding ring! Oh dear! What an atrocity! I think not, just plain stupid. He then attempts to open the cupboard door he attempted to open on more than one occasion during the film, and then realises he can't open it because Anna has blocked the door with boxes, as revealed by the camera as it falls back to show the boxes. Yet another unfulfilled, pointless, random scene. Wouldn't you notice the boxes before then? A confused and upset Malcolm then rushes upstairs to the bedroom and discovers his wound from the gunshot. Cue plot hole number 7; who in their right mind doesn't notice a gaping hole in their stomach for over a year? Malcolm really isn't on the ball is he? Anyway, he realises he's actually dead now and puts two and two together as to why his wife has been ignoring him. After a few flashbacks we realise Anna wasn't actually in a mood with Malcolm, she just never saw him! Oh the twists and turns of this film just get worse, don't they? Cheesefest. Malcolm has a conversation with Anna, as Cole told him to. He says he loves her and that she wasn't second best to his job. Oh, what a lovely ending. The screen then fades to black. Fin.Another plot hole/random 'detail' I noticed was the amount of red props used in the film (Lynn's red nails, Cole's red sweater, the red balloon at the birthday party, etc). The camera makes a bee line for all these random red items but we never really find out why. According to Shymalan, it symbolised something the audience had to figure out. I didn't figure it out, it's just too out of place and stupid.'
I -like many thanks to good promotion - went to the cinema without any idea of "the oh-so clever ending" and came out not really caring. I'm not going to critise anyone involved in the film as the direction was exellent and Bruce Willis put in a very good preformance, the kid, whatever his name is, was believable and on the whole the story was well told.But so what, the script was nothing more than another quirky idea from Hollywood and really didn't drag you into the situation, it was nothing special and the reason it did so well was because it posed as an intelligent film with blockbuster selling points. Add to this the fact that the cinema was more popular than ever this year and people aren't wanting to see ***** in another "I have more guns than you have" film and it was bound to be a huge hit, but it didn't really deserve it.


                
Let me begin by saying that Sixth Sense is not a "bad" movie, instead it is an average movie.  The whole film was built ground up from the ending, and no film has ever made it so painfully obvious that the ending was written first and then a story was added to make it long enough.  Also I have a terrible bit of information to tell everyone, Bruce Willis is really bad at acting like he cares.  It didn't work in Armageddon, it doesn't work here, and it's not going to work the next time he's cast as a truly caring man. Though in all honesty if you think about this film in great detail you realize he does not care, and is simply incredibly self-serving.  Despite all my personal distaste for this film, it is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is nothing more than average.  The plot is relatively simple, and if you go into the theater actually thinking you'll know how the movie is going to end within half an hour.  The only real reason to see this movie is so that you can see if you can figure out the ending before the end of the film.  After you've seen this once and seen how it ends, it is incredibly unlikely that the weak plot line will be enough to draw you back for a second time.  This movie can be fun as a one-time mind quest to figure out the conclusion, but once you know the ending, this movie really has very little, if anything to offer.


                
My friends had all told me that the Sixth Sense was an incredible movie.Some even told me it was better than Blair Witch Project.So, since I had some free passes to the movies, I took my friend Cathy to see it last night.The first 100 minutes or so passed at an incredibly boring pace. Nothing much seemed to happen at all.After being shot by a former patient, child psychologist Bruce Willis decides to help a child who shows the same symptoms that this patient did. At the loss of his family life, he throws himself into helping this boy who can see dead people. That's the basic premise. Boring, I say.The movie plods along at a snail's pace, and the lines are tired cliches, ie: Bruce Willis: "My plan is blah blah blah". Boy: "Will it work?" Bruce: "I don't know..."Give me a break! Come up with something original! The idea of seeing dead people is pretty interesting, and they could've done something cool with it, but instead you get 100 minutes of boring film stock and tired cliches for dialogue and plot movement. The filmmakers even employed the standard "shocking" music to get you to jump at the slightest "gross" thing, things that weren't even scary.In the final 2 or 3 minutes, the film pulls itself together and comes up with a completely amazing ending that made me not hate the film. It did, however, make me angry for not hating the film, and left me wishing that I had left in the middle of the movie so I could have been left with a feeling of utter disappointment.In a summer of movies like American Pie, Blair Witch Project, South Park, Eyes Wide Shut, and Austin Powers 2, maybe I just had too high of expectations. Don't waste your money on this crapfest.


                
The story moved like molasses from the opening title screen on.  I was having trouble staying awake for most of it.  Little and no musical accompaniment didn't help.  There were about 3 'gotchas' when considering the length of the movie, there could have had at least 10.  I figured out the 'surprise' ending less then half way through the film.  The only bright point was the acting in the kid.  A couple of scenes were overacted just a tad, but this little guy is overall a fine actor.  The mother did a good job too in a working-class role.  I did love the shots of Philadelphia.  It was nice to see Bruce Willis without a gun in his hand.  I feel he did an adequate job in his role.  I think the only reason people are raving about it is because he has had so many macho roles that people had typecast him. I think most people liked it because they didn't foresee the ending.  For those of us that did, the movie wasn't nearly as fun.  My recommendation is if you have to see it, wait for it on video.


                
The problem I, and everybody else in my party, had with this film, was its' apparent inability to decide what exactly it was trying to do.  Was this a psychological thriller?  Was this a ghost story? Was this a horror film? A scene that featured a young teen with the back of his head blown off as he turns away from the camera seemed to suggest this was a horror/ghost story type of film, but the script verged on more thoughtfullness than that. Pensive performances punctuated this schizo feeling.  The film had dangling story lines throughout - but we all admitted, the twist at the end of the movie salvaged it.  We saw a sneak preview, and the audience, too, seemed to agree with us.  Some fool brought their 7 year old child to the screening, and the kid, seemingly bored out of his mind, started tossing his hat up into the air.  Somebody hollared out, "If your bored, why don't you leave?" Uh, nobody said he was bored, but it was a good supposition.


                
Before seeing this movie, I had heard there was a surprise ending.  I knew no more than that and was able to come up with a nice twist ending before seeing the movie.  True to my instincts, this movie ended exactly as I predicted.  Because I had already figured out the ending, the clues in the movie seemed so obvious to me, I wondered why people were not figuring it all out.  But people are surprised are by the ending, and I can't understand why.  This movie might be worthwhile if you can't pick up on clues.  But I could not enjoy it.  Some reviewers say once you see it once, you have to review the movie to understand everything.  Well because I had already guessed the ending, I felt like I had already seen this movie and every scene just led up to an already known end.  I don't know whether to be proud or disappointed.  Proud as in I guessed the ending before seeing the movie or disappointed as in the writers couldn't come up with anything better. I was left with a "that's it?" feeling.  So if you already have an idea as to what the "surprise" ending is, then do not go see this movie, you're probably right.  But if you can't even fathom a guess or don't like to think during a movie, then by all means go see it.At least the actors were good...


                
With all of the good commentaries I read about "TSS" I expected much more out of the film than I got.The main problem with the film is its persistent slowness and confusing development. Some of the supernatural the child "sees" is given without any explanation, like the "ghosts" in the story have no other purpose but to frighten the viewer. The film suffers from a short attention span, jumping from one storyline right to the other with no explanation. The film also focuses too heavily on the score; there is a point where Willis and the boy are sitting in a room by themselves for about a half minute, not saying a word, while the film's music is playing at full forte. Had there been an important plot revelation at the time it would have seemed sensible, but the attitude was more like, "we spent x number of dollars on this score, so we darn better well use it anywhere we can."The ending of the movie is genius (which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of one) but by the time I reached it I was so bored and disappointed that it did not have much of an effect on me. It seemed like the writer dreamed up of a perfect ending to a movie but could not put anything worthwile as filler. If the movie was more like an hour-long "Amazing Stories" episode, it would have been perfect; but as is it was a little too drawn out for me.***/out of ten


                
This film is SLOW.Much of the first hour is spent repeating similar dialogue over and over.  Bruce Willis is far better suited to his roles as a laconic super-hero than a stuffy child psychologist. As for the "surprise" ending, I'm afraid I figured it out about forty minutes in, and once you strip that element away, the film has next to nothing.My advice.....wait for it to come on TV for free, there's no way I'd pay to see it again.3 out of 10  (at the most)


                
How can a ghost throw an object at a window? How can the grandmother, who is a ghost, steal a physical object? They might as well have ended the movie with the same absurd outlandishness as the utterly silly movie "Ghost" with Patrick Swayze, and just have Bruce Willis hug and kiss his wife goodbye at the end. They already ruined it as a serious, believable horror movie, so why not finish it off in the same ridiculous manner. I mean if Patrick Swayze as a ghost can beat up a fellow with a physical body, and Bruce Willis as a ghost can pick up and throw corporeal objects, why not go all out and just give the movie an ending with the same silly elements they already added in to the movie. At least they would win over people like my elderly mother who would rent it for the silly, "feel good" 100% Hollywood ending. As it stands now, mature Horror fans rate this movie closer to "Ghost" due to the superfluous inane segments, far away from something more sophisticated like "Rosemary's Baby", which treats its subject matter with more seriousness, depth, and overall respect.


                
What can I say... Points for Bruce Willis. Points for Haley Joel Osment. Negative points for insufferable auteur M. Night Shyamalan. Bad dialog, poor pacing. A "surprise" ending telegraphed well in advance. The gulf between the talents of the actors and the writer/director have rarely been so obvious.I suppose if you like M. Night Shyamalan's work, you might like this as well. The only thing on his resume which would recommend him to me is as the writer of "Stuart Little" - and even that was hardly world-class!If, on the other hand, you like the works of directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanly Kubrick, Mimi Leder, or Joe Dante as I do, "The Sixth Sense" is a pretty poor waste of a couple of hours of your life.


                
How did he last so long being ignored by his wife?Why does nobody get freaked out by the moving chair in the restaurant?How did he book an appointment with a kid? Did his Mum ring a dead mans phone? Did the kid arrange the appointment? Does he not need to confirm with his guardian he can talk to their kid? How did he get in the house? Did he knock on the door and not get acknowledged by the mother but still decided to walk in? Can he walk through walls? Does he not think it's weird he can walk through walls?Hmmm.
Well I'am very confused about myself concerning this film. The first time I saw it (about two years before) I was greatly impressed and its end really shocked me. Recently I recommended it to my wife and proposed her to see it together. The video player started and I was sitting by her ready to respond to her admiration (as I expected). What happened really shocked me. It was not about her but rather about me. I discovered a sluggish scenario, an intolerable cool looking Willis, an unrealistic performance by a 10 year old child, gaps, Jumps and oversimplifications in the story and so on. Approaching the end my wife told me, what kind of crap you made me see and lost my evening, he is also dead isn't he? I surprisingly responded, how did get it? well!! piece of cake, she replied, even a child can foresee it. That was the end of all. She has a good judgment of movies so her phrase shock me. The magic was all lost. Conclusion. This is the first time it happened to me. Usually when I see a film again it is because I am sure 100% that it worth it. I am a voracious film eater and I cant be wrong. Final comments. A childish scenario, a commercially promoted film that otherwise could be a masterpiece in another director's hands. If I rate this with 3 then "The others" and Nicol Kindman as the key actor is rated 10.


                
This was the first Shymalan's flick and i have to say that he made a good work creating a dark environment which is essential for a thriller. I guess the end was also a bit unexpected which gave some points on the project. Thats all with the positive side of the film. I'm afraid that the negative overcomes the positive easily. When i first saw this film i thought it was OK. I gave the creator the benefit of the doupth since it was his first movie and all.This changed rapidly after watching his second movie.You see i didn't like the first one, i didn't liked it at all, but i convinced myself i didn't hate it cause i thought the director, as a first timer, having a low budget to work with he presented at least a honest effort to the public. Later on, after i watched Unbreakable and realized that this was the way that M.N.Shyamalan really wanted to direct i let myself free and expressed my true opinion. This movie sucked as his second one. The budget of the flick wasn't small(we are talking about 60.000.000 dollars) and the absence of the visual F\X wasn't something of a trick to cover the absence of money in production. The Matrix was shoot with the same amount of money and you can see where the money went. Here nothing really happens. The action is slow, the acting is just tolerable and the script was a bit boring except the very original ending. This is one of the few ghost stories that i've seen with absolutely no visual effects(the others were mostly b-movies and low budget cults which by the way i enjoyed more). I don't want to get into details but i've also noticed some mistakes-gups in the script which, i'm sure, most of the people that have seen this film also noticed. The only thing that's annoying for me is the money that this film gathered at the box office, which were a lot. Watching all of Syamalans films makes me believe that he tricks people to watching them. He selects catchy topics for his movies and then he plays a game. The game is shooting the movies using minimum f\x trying to gather maximum people at the cinemas. I can say that he does this with success but i think that he is already a castaway in the minds of the true Sci-Fi of Horror fans. Don't take me wrong, i'm not into senseless use of CGI effects which can turn a movie in a video game(see Van Helsing) but when the topic is from the world of fantasy the director should add effects and substance creating a unique result.Anyway i believe that people who haven't already seen the "Sixth Sense" should probably do it but i "sense" that this will be a one way ride and probably will never watch it again......I sure didn't.


                
The only positive thing I have to say about this film is that it had a nice ending which tied everything together.  Other than that, it had absolutely ZERO plot or character development.  It's obviously Bruce Willis' attempt to break into "serious" acting...it seems more like his attempt to revive his previous career of pointless movies like Die Hard or its thousand sequels. See it  once for the ending, then burn it.


                
The most surprising thing in the ending of this film is that it actually ended - it seemed to drag forever, never getting anywhere. Bruce Willis, after getting tired of standard issue action films, became rather irregular in choosing scripts. After the superb "Fifth Element", I had high hopes for the "Sixth Sense", but, other than the ending, there is nothing original here, it's just "Ghost II - The Mission".Of course, once you accept the existence of supernatural phenomena there are very few surprises left; anything is possible, since the supernatural laws seem to be very flexible. In this film there is no evident clue to strictly define it as a "supernatural phenomena" sort of film, so I kept wondering if there would be a natural explanation that put everything back in our physical universe, transforming it from the "terror" to the "thriller" category. No such luck. We get the same old story, so many times told. "Some people are able to see ghosts and become scared by them at first, but ghosts are just people who died with their missions in the Earth incomplete, and they need help from living persons to finish their tasks so they can progress further to their final destiny". Please, tell me something new, this story can become boring after a century or two.All in all, it's a linear plot, corny, absolutely humorless, full of clichés, with flat characters. Its only redeeming quality is the photography, appropriately dark, cloudy outdoors and sparsely illuminated indoors.Better see again that old Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore tape, rather than waste your time watching this crap.


                
I wish people would stop calling this a horror movie... it's an overly-sentimental wishy-washy piece of Hollywood tripe that is way too slow-paced. if you consider this a "horror" film, why doesn't "Ghost" get a horror classification,


                
I really dont understand why people like this movie so much. Most of the time it was unexciting and bland, and the storyline just seemed to drag on to an implausible ending of confusement. bruce willis was absurd as usual, when is this guy gonna give up trying to act in what could be top-notch thrillers and go back to meaningless action romps? Osmond was okay, you have to give him credit for working with such a 'twilight-zone' script, though I must admit Toni Collete did outshine as the disturbed boys mother.The simple fact is, for me at least - this movie would have looked better on the small screen as an episode of the X--files or the Twilight-Zone. It just didnt have the strength in characterisation or thrills to make it exciting as a two hour holywood movie. And of course.. like most hollywood entertainment reviewers do..they hyped the movie up and it was applauded by all alike, just beacuse the genre was 'unique' and 'different' from the rest of the crap that hollywood produces.Though the storyline and genre are certainly unique. And the movie is interesting to watch..it certainly isnt as brilliant as what everyone makes it out to be.


                
Neither a terrible movie nor a great one.  Just one of the many movies that fall in the middle, despite the hype.  The supposed "twist" at the end is telegraphed early on, and so isn't surprising when it comes, although it is well handled when it finally arrives.  While Haley Osment and Bruce Willis are good actors, the dialogue between them is stilted, and the movie drags for a long stretch in the middle.  When the situation between them finally gets resolved, it is handled in too perfunctory a fashion given all the time spent leading up to it.  A lot of time is spent between Willis and Osment accomplishing little, then one incident is shown leading towards the resolution, and then the situation is resolved, and that's it. 4/10.


                
This is without a doubt the most overlooked movie of the decade. All the talk, all the excitement, all that buzz. But for what. Just a very simple story, with a very thin line, that has (I have to agree) a truly great twist at the end, which makes you remember it. But having said that: one great twist can't make up for this boring story with very bad acting performances. So let someone tell you the story, fast forward the movie and then watch the end. That way you have a very satisfying ten minutes and you don't have to sit through the rest.


                
SPOILER ALERT I cannot believe that this was so highly commended by others. The phrase of Latin which meant *nothing* to the plot, the ineptitude of a man who, after a year of trying to eat or go to the bathroom without avail, discovers that he is a corpse only through a child, are only two of the many silly elements in the plot. A cute kid actor and a committee-written plot certainly seemed to play well with the public, but when you look beneath the hood, there was very little there. Fight Club, for all its own inconsistencies, had much more to say to the soul. This is where the best version of Sixth Sense lies.
SPOILER ALERTFirst of all I must admit that most of the movie is quite OK. But this ending .... Well I have to SPOIL, you're warned :So the guy is dead. And he notices that when he sees his wife crying over his wedding ring or whatever (I can't remember exactly). And that's supposed to be very powerful. In fact we're given clues (no one ever really speks to him, but it's not very obvious so you can't guess). Well, that's just PLAIN STUPID ! How can the guy hang around for month without noticing he's dead ??? - No one speaks to him - How can he open doors ? Does he walk through walls ? - How can he eat ? If he doesn't then he should realize there's something weird, shouldn't he? etc etc etc (See slothfratelli's review, it's more complete !! ) In one word it is impossible. I really felt cheated when I saw this. So, please if you liked the end, check it twice : you've been cheated.By the way, I read some reviews where the author supposedly guessed everything and found this movie predictable. I wonder how you can predict such an illogical end. Really, I wonder.Above all, I still don't understand why such a small amount of people noticed the conclusion of this movie was awfully illogical (less than 10% if we admit IMDB reviews are statistically representative).Considering all this, the 6th sense deserves no more than 4/10.
