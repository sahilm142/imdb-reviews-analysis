 Good but not quite one of the greatest films of all time

 A Hitchcock classic, but not among his best

 "A little more polished than the others... but I'm afraid just as obvious."

 Engaging From Start To Finish

 An Exciting Spy-Thriller!

 Hitchcock once again

 "I never make love on an empty stomach..."

 Influential spy epic

 Harder to love than to solve a mystery

 Ordinary Man - Extraordinary Situation - Classic Hitchcock

 My wives divorced me. Said I led too dull a life

 It's because of the airline he flies with, people.

 ahead of its time

 Mr. Kaplan where you at?!

 Good Hitchcock film except for the abrupt ending

 North by Northwest

 Fun,fast paced and entertaining Hitchcock ,but don't expect depth,

 I rank it as Hitchcock's 19th best, myself

 A bit disappointed

 Disappointment. But still a good movie to watch

 The master of suspense forgot to put the suspense in

 "Games . . . must we?"

 Good just good

 A Well-Constructed Spy Romp

 The last of the really good Hitchcock films? Not so sure.
