 Season 1 got me Season 2 is looooosing me

 Season 2 not living up to potential of Season 1 AT ALL

 Too many cooks- not enough quality ingredients.

 Season 1 really good, season 2 was a chore to watch

 We need to talk about season 2

 Brilliant first season, disappointing 2nd

 Some thoughts seeing this series

 Brilliant first series...

 Season One is great, Season Two, not so much

 They should stop it after season one

 Season 1 excellent, season 2 confusing

 Watch it

 Season one outstanding, season two very mediocre

 First season = WOW! Second season = WHY? (edit/update)

 Intriguing but perhaps too bleak.

 Well done but...

 Season 1 Good Season 2 Bad

 Disappointing

 Season 2: The violence makes them feel less human

 Westworld review

 Season 2 sucks. No strory

 What's it with Season 2?

 Good Enough For A "B-"

 I'm Yul Brynner..., and I'm dead now.

 Over exaggerated
