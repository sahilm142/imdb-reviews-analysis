Boring, tedious, a hugely underwhelming experience. This could have been a good movie with a director and an editor who were not asleep at the wheel and knew when enough was enough! Huge unwanted pregnant pauses, moody silences, all the narcissistic art house red flags, on the same par with the equally boring "The tree of Life" from a few years ago! A major disappointment, I was actually looking forward to it but after slogging through the first slower than slow 70 minutes I realized that it was not going to get any better, yet I stayed for till the end, bigger fool I! "Winter Sleep" is an ironic title because it certainly lead me to the land of nod!


                
Reasonably engaging but slow and seemingly interminable.A man, Aydin (played by Haluk Bilginer) and his wife run a small hotel in a small village in central Anatolia, Turkey. The movie examines the relationships between Aydin and some of the other people in the village, and how these relationships change.Fairly engaging - you do feel for Aydin in his various predicaments. However, the movie is ponderously slow and, at over three hours, incredibly long. This tests your commitment and engagement, and ultimately the movie is quite dull. Is it too much to ask to move things along at something other than snail's pace, and to wrap it up quicker?


                
I really didn't enjoy the movie, the characters are not deeply interesting, the feelings it shows are not even visceral, it is not innovative, its not dramatic, there are no breakdowns or changes in history, not interesting at all. Even if the landscapes are impressive, the history is too flat, the regular life of almost everybody would describe better the human behavior. This movie its more like a thriller that shows only the barren aspects of peoples interactions with each other.
