Nicole and Christina believe they have committed the perfect murder of a lover and husband who was anything but the tenderhearted, most loving person in the world. That man is Michel, a principal of a male boarding school his wife Christina paid for with her wealth. Michel holds everyone at bay because he has this powerfully vile hold over everyone from his perpetually "walking-on-egg-shells" wife to the teachers under his watch. He is really abusive toward Christina who is weak with an exterior so shaken with fear she suffers from a heart condition. What makes the opening of this film so fascinating is Clouzot doesn't show the building of the set-up for murdering Michel, but we hear through their dialogue this planning of the event for quite some time. What is also jarring is that Nicole and Christina seem to be friendly with one another which is startling since Nicole is Michel's lover. There's an instance when Nicole is about to share what Michel told her in bed regarding his wishes for his wife's demise to Christina! It is quite interesting that Nicole is the instigator of the actions that soon occur regarding how they set-up Michel and kill him. We watch as this whole scenario takes place which leaves little doubt that Nicole and been premeditating how to kill Michel for quite some time. One mistake of course is deciding to include Christina in her plans to the whole set-up and murder since she's so weak-kneed that any little minute ordeal would throw her into a frenzy.Once the deed is indeed over and they toss Michel's body in the nasty, murky pool beside the school, it's all about someone discovering it. That tricky part really ratchets up the true tension in the story. Christina, who is finding it unbearable waiting day after day as that body is supposedly waiting on the bottom undiscovered, has the pool drained but, to her horror, no body is found. Where did that body go? Who removed it? Was he dead? Throughout the film, Nicole and Christina deal with the underlying guilt from their deed and mistrust which starts to loom over their "relationship" like a rain-cloud when going to the police station often becomes a topic of conversation.A detective makes things even worse as he represents a constant reminder that their crime is always on display as awaiting that final axe to chop never goes away. Christina is also a devout catholic which only adds to the luggage of guilt already weighing her down.Good casting, very intelligent story-line(that develops after the "perfect murder" rather than focusing on it as what usually takes place in mysteries), and a suspenseful build-up with questions abound that keeps the viewer guessing at what will happen as that body stays missing. Though clues of his existence as a living man seems possible, the film is slippery at actually showing him while pulsating the theme of Christina's inner strife at what she has done. Great film-making in every possible way.
Before I saw this film, I wouldn't go near a 'thriller', or a foreign film, and definitely not one that was made thirty years before I was born.Afterwards however, I couldn't get enough. Vera Clouzot is, quite frankly, mesmerising in the lead, and the film has plenty of genuinely chilling moments, not least with the image in the window.Foreign language films can be a bit daunting at first, but this is a great place to start, and fans of any age would be well advised to check it out.Henri Clouzot has been compared to Hitchcock, but this film seems to creep up on you even more than Psycho, and for its age, is doubtlessly one of the best films around.
Greetings from Lithuania."Diabolique" (1955) is a really good mystery drama. It starts as a drama and then later some of the characters must done something horrible, but the true suspense comes after something very "not according to a plan" happens.I liked the performances in this movie. Directing and writing was also great, as well as the involving story. The ending was surprising as well.Overall, "Diabolique" isn't a horror movie as its genre description says - its a very solid mystery drama. It has involving story and it is very well done. Good movie overall.


                
Diabolique is the kind of film that one should never see more than once, and no film maker should ever try to make it again. My first viewing in the mid 1950s was a great movie experience. I was drawn to the wonderful suspenseful picture that M. Clouzot had made and was blow away by the ending. That should have been the end. Last night after more than 50 years I watched it again. Poor me. I was doomed to watch a great suspense film but I knew how it ended. There's something punishing in that. So all I could do was to be impressed with the acting, the photography, the film sets, and criticize some of its implausibility (What well- off French family would send a kid to this school? Who wouldn't want the two woman to kill off "The Head" someone without any redeeming human values? Why was the ending made so abrupt when it was the key to the picture and needed some digestion?) I must say that Mdm Clouzot's death portrayal was worth seeing again. It's better than anything James Cagney ever did. And the retired police commish could have been good for a series of about four more mysteries.
I just saw this 50's mystery thriller, and I was surprised. Most movies made in the 50's don't scare me, but this film left me trembling.The film tells the story of two women working for a cruel and abusive boarding school principal. Tired of being hurt, verbally and physically, the women plan and execute the man's murder during the holidays. I don't want to give away too much, for it's vital you see it without knowing the ending. The last fifteen minutes of this film pack a strong and chilling punch with wonderful suspense and subtlety you don't see anymore. It is a masterful thriller with a twist ending matching that of "Psycho" and "The Sixth Sense". I recommend it to anyone who is able to watch older movies. Fans of slasher and killer films that get their scares from gore and shocks, stay away.


                
For a brief period during the 1950s, French director Henri-Georges Clouzot temporarily swiped the title of "The Master of Suspense" from Alfred Hitchcock, owing to a string of well-received suspense thrillers, most notably 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' The latter was an adaptation of the novel "Celle qui n'était plus (She Who Was No More)" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac; it was released in the UK as 'The Devils,' and in the United States as 'Diabolique.' Upon its initial release, the film was extensively likened to the work of Hitchcock {who, popular legend tells us, missed out on purchasing the novel rights by a mere few hours}, with its slow-burning, deliberately-paced suspense, and a shocking twist that I never for a moment saw coming. Though, with the notable exception of two scenes <U+0096> both involving a murder, with only one of them being real <U+0096> the film isn't particularly scary, the tension, the paranoia and the blackened shadows often become overwhelming, and Clouzot deftly toes the line between supernatural evil, and the evil that lurks within all of us.Christina Delassalle (Véra Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), both teachers at a boarding school for young boys, have a rather peculiar friendship. Christina is married to Michel (Paul Meurisse), a violent and tyrannical husband who derives pleasure from humiliating his pretty but physically-delicate wife. Nicole, conversely, is Michel's mistress, a proud and independent woman who knows how to take control of a situation. At one point in the film, upon witnessing the two woman quietly conversing, a fellow professor makes a fascinated remark: "I may be reactionary, but this is absolutely astounding - the legal wife consoling the mistress! No, no, and no!" The mere fact that Christina and Nicole have become close should already hint at a sinister situation underlying the surface, and, indeed, it is soon revealed that the two women plan to murder Michel and ridding themselves of his oppression. The "murder" itself <U+0096> a sedative in the alcohol, and drowning their unconscious victim in the bathtub, is exceedingly disturbing, as we guiltily and uneasily ask ourselves if we'd have the courage to carry through such a scheme.Alfred Hitchcock often delighted in creating suspense through the audience's subversive empathy for a film's villain, as a murderer attempts frantically to remove all traces of their crime. Clouzot uses a similar technique in his film, though, given the loathsome nature of the murder victim, our sympathy for the two women is almost demanded of us. However, the disappearance of Michel's body from the school swimming pool is completely unexpected, and either hints at a supernatural overtone, or that somebody else is quite obviously aware of their terrible crime. The paranoia from here rarely lets up, and we continually bombard ourselves with an endless stream of questions, unable to provide an answer for any of them. On a weaker note, despite the ever-present air of tension, few scenes actually succeeded in getting my heart pumping at a mile-a-minute, which was a slightly disappointing response that I can't quite explain. Perhaps a few sequences need to have been shortened slightly, just to swipe off ten unnecessary minutes, and allowing for a brisker pace that never gives you a chance to exhale.
Diaboliques, Les (known in the US as Diabolique or also The Devils) is one of the greatest suspense films.The acting is solid.Paul Meurisse plays Michel Delasalle a nasty head master of a boys school. He abuses his wife Christina (Vera Clouzot - wife of the director in real life.). Simone Signoret plays Nicole Horner a teacher at the school. Charles Vanel steals the movie as Alfred Fichet a private detective. Vera Clouzot is beautiful as the abused wife and Simone Signoret is also good as her friend.Made in 1955 it was directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. His films are similar to Alfred Hitchcock's and he was known as "the French Hitchcock." Clouzot barely beat out Hitch for the rights to The Pierre Boileau novel upon which Dialbolique is based. Hitchcock considered Clouzot a rival and partially made Psycho in order to top Dialbolique. Unfortunately, Clouzot had ill health which diminished his film output. Another great Clouzot film is Wages of Fear (Salaire de la peur, Le (1953) which was remade as Sorcerer by William Friedman. The movie is subtitled but don't let that put you off. You will recognize many scenes in this movie that have been copied over and over in suspense films. This is a film you can see many times and enjoy. By all means avoid the remake of the movie with Sharon Stone which is terrible.


                
Les Diaboliques is not only a classic of the genre, it is the blueprint from which so many of today's suspense films use as a guide. Even the great Alfred Hitchcock was inspired by this macabre masterpiece from French director Henri Clouzot. I just finished watching the Criterion DVD of this gem and, although it is not as pristine as some other Criterion offerings, it does represent the best quality you are likely to find of this better than 40-year-old film.There are three reference standard items to watch for in this film. Naturally, the ending is what garners the most attention and the fact that Clouzot originated the idea of asking his audience not to reveal it to other would-be filmgoers. But, the cinematography used here is excellent in all its black and white glory. The opening credit sequence with raindrops splashing on the pavement in the background is captivating. The third item to watch for is the portrayal of the police inspector. Not only is it an uncanny resemblance to Peter Falk in his Columbo character -- this is in fact the very character that inspired Columbo and his idiosyncracies (ie. rumpled look, cigar, seemingly distracted manner).Most people who are students of film or just plain looking for a good suspense flick will not be disappointed in this landmark feature. Don't even think about confusing this with the 90's schlock attempted copy.

Perfect murder plot? Clouzot sets the mood- 
Boarding school turns sinister, 
Mystery abounds! A tad outdated, 
But clever camera work 
And fine directing. Far-fetched with plot holes, 
Too dawdling for "suspenseful"- 
But still worth the wait. Masterminded twist ending- 
That in hindsight seems so clear! Haiku Sonnets are comprised of 4 3-line haiku plus a couplet of either 5 or 7 syllables, adding up to 14 lines, the same number of lines found in a sonnet.

. . . of this often mislabeled flick. If you cut out the groaning toilets, bellowing pipes, thundering bath tubs, and plugged up pools gurgling throughout DIABOLIQUE, you wouldn't have much of a movie left. As the plot takes its characters from city to village to last chance gas station all around France, the one constant here is lavatory facilities that no doubt date back to the Era of Napoleon (if not Charlemagne). Should anyone in a large building unleash a loo, the resulting racket proves ear-shattering for folks several floors or hallways removed. Tubs are even worse, easily drowning out the din made by lawn mowers or revving jet engines, as these "Moaning Myrtles" register 150 decibels plus. It's not too hard to understand why the average French swimming pool is filthier than the waste tank at a pig farm, given the lacking of being drained after their initial installation. DIABOLIQUE documents why no one from Nice to Dunkirk dare empty a natatorium, because the ensuing cacophony is enough to literally raise the dead. My brother-in-law is a master plumber, and he tells me that his French counterparts are eligible for "Poolitical Asylum" in the U.S.
I'm in two minds, however, about H.G. Clouzot's Les Diaboliques. It is certainly a movie that captured audiences in 1955. On a recent viewing of Criterion's excellent DVD, however, holes in the plot became more evident, and, even worse, the acting of Simone Signoret deteriorates badly. The similarities to Vertigo (which Boileau and Narcejac wrote for Hitchcock when Clouzot outbid him for the rights to Diabolique) are also a minus. Fortunately, the squalid boarding-school setting is still rich in atmosphere and veteran actor Pierre Larquey's impersonation of a put-upon schoolmaster rates as one of the finest of his extensive (well over 200 movies!) career. Charles Vanel, however, is wasted in a minor role as a last act, intrusive, yet ultimately miscalculating ex-policeman.
I'm not generally given to superlatives and was quite taken by the number of reviewers here who make the claim for "Diabolique" as the most suspenseful film of all time. I too actually thought it was very good with a caveat that comes with the finale of the story which I'll get to in a bit. Director Clouzot really did a masterful job in extending the long exposition of this mystery. If one is fully engaged in the story, it's like chomping at the bit to figure out what's going on with the missing corpse from the pool and unexplained sightings of Michel Delassalle after he'd been 'murdered'. One should probably be able to see the twist coming, and maybe you could in another film, but this is one that plays on one's imagination in a way that blinds you to the eventual outcome. I thought it was just magnificently done.The thing that bothered me about the ending are twofold. In the first instance, even if Michel (Paul Meurisse) and his lover Nicole (Simone Signoret) did manage to scare the frail Christina (Vera Clouzot) to death, what would be the basis for retired police commissioner Alfred Fichet (Charles Vanel) to arrest him for? Scaring someone to death to my mind seems more like conjecture than a chargeable crime. Who could prove it? Even though Fichet overheard the conversation between the conspirators, I don't see why a sharp lawyer couldn't put the blame on Christina's easily confirmed medical history and recent weakened condition.The other issue comes courtesy of the young boy Moinet (Yves Marie-Maurin) who was disbelieved by all who heard him state that he saw the school principal after he disappeared. When he says he 'saw' Christina after she collapsed and was presumed dead, there was no confirmation in the story to prove the point. I'll grant that it was a good hook to keep the viewer guessing, just as it was the first time with Michel's 'murder'. But with former cop Fichet on hand, and school personnel around who would have to have removed the body, wouldn't it have to be established that she was actually dead? If one presumes so, then the scene with Moinet is a moot one.One thought I had while watching was that this would have been a good film for Alfred Hitchcock to take under his wing, and was pleasantly educated by a handful of reviewers who stated that he missed getting the script for this film by a whisker. "Diabolique" was certainly worthy of a Hitchcock treatment, as I found it better than some of his venerated films like "Strangers on a Train" and "Shadow of a Doubt". If one disregards some of my earlier critique, I think it holds up as a pretty suspenseful thriller that keeps you guessing right till the very end.
Les diaboliques is a compelling mystery with a hint of crime & horror elements. It is about two women who conspire to murder their lover and the mysterious series of events that occur after his body disappears.The two protagonists', Nicole Horner (Simone Sgnoret), and Christina Delasalle (Véra Clouzot), performances helped add the horror aspect to the movie. They were captivating and navigated skillfully the guilt- determination dilemma. The settings were not that varied yet sufficient to the story's development and the lightning tricks helped fuel the viewer's curiosity and attachment to the story line.The innovative, eventful story line is complemented by the actors' performances and a spot on cinematography to amount to one of the few movies that could compete with Hitchcock in the genre he defined.An appropriate tag-line for the movie would be "things aren't always what they seem"It's a classic masterpiece of the genre that any film aficionado should not miss.


                
A slow-burn thriller about the fragile wife of a sadistic boarding school master and his mistress, who hatch a plan to murder their husband/lover to pay him back for all the abuse they've both had to endure.Vera Clouzot, real-life wife of the film's director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, plays the wife in the movie, but Simone Signoret, as the cool-headed and cynical mistress, steals the show. It was hard not to come to the film with a heap of expectations given its reputation, and I have to admit I was a bit let down by it. The real plot of the film begins not with the headmaster's murder, but with his corpse's disappearance and unsettling episodes that begin to lead the wife and mistress to suspect that he may not be dead. I thought the film was going to venture into some interesting psychological terrain, and even began to suspect that it was going to go into Bergman territory and have some sort of twist in which we learn that there aren't really two women at all, but rather two different facets to the same woman's personality -- the cold and cruel strength of the mistress representing what the wife would be if she weren't a near invalid. But the film doesn't get that intellectually complex, and instead tells a literal mystery story with a twist ending that probably seemed much more shocking at the time but is blunted now by the fact that we live in a culture of twist movie endings. It's not exactly a fault of the movie; I can't blame it for not being something it never intended to be. But I can't help my reaction to it either and my disappointment that it didn't end up being more interesting than it was.Still, it's a very good and effective movie and has a great look to it. There are a couple of genuinely creepy scenes, the kind that make it the perfect film to watch on a cold, rainy night.Grade: A-


                
"Diabolique" is a horror movie in which we watch the wife of a cruel and very strict headmaster and his mistress conspire to kill him. After this murder is body is disappeared and some strange events begin to happen and disturb the two women.I liked this movie because of the plot which had much of suspense and mystery in the whole duration of it something that I found very nice and interesting for a movie. It also had many swifts that did not let you even think what will happen next. I also liked it because of the direction which made by Henri - Georges Clouzot and he did a very good job on it. About the interpretations I have to say that the interpretation of Véra Clouzot who played as Christina Delassalle was simply outstanding. Equally good was the interpretation of Simone Signoret who played as Nicole Horner.Finally I have to say that "Diabolique" is a very good and interesting movie to watch because it combines very well mystery with thriller and the result from this combination is success.


                
This movie is a great thriller! For me personally it's about 20 minutes too long. Condensed version would be more spectacular and even more enjoyable.Still, the plot of this movie is absolutely amazing!!!!! Plot really is somewhere around a 10 /10.**************SPOILER ALERT******************************************The distractions that you suspect might be the plot twist are just distractions, behind that there is another greater twist awaiting.1st distraction: "oh, how are they going to hide the murder" ; then later 2nd distraction "oh, what, did he actually survive! Wow! He is going to avenge himself!!".. And then later .. the truth is revealed and it's wow!! He was cooperating with Nicole the entire time. And it doesn't end there, because there is one final twist in the one final scene of the movie. It's ambivalent , but it could be that Mrs.Delassalle is actually alive! So yeah, great great plot!The cast was good. But it could be better I must admit. Nicole was very average. Mrs. Delassalle was average. Mr. Delassalle was pretty good. And the detective was pretty good as well. So, basically female roles could be much better. Average just doesn't cut it, when you want to make a great movie.Also, the first 20 minutes of the movie are a bit shaky. It could be so much better. The relationship between Delassalles is not well established.Then, once it starts going it is great. But it should trimmed down some 10-20 minutes. A very good movie.Real rating: 8.3
The wife of a cruel headmaster and his mistress conspire to kill him, but after the murder is committed, his body disappears, and strange events begin to plague the two women.I really feel little need to comment on this film, which has widely been seen as one of the Top 100 horror films ever made, and has been increasingly seen as one of the best films overall. IMDb (as of October 2013) has it in the #150 range, and the relatively recent Criterion special edition certainly did not hurt.The best scene happens later on, so I cannot talk about that in this review. But many good moments happen, including the wife having to identify a body as her husband's. The process is interesting and puts her in a tense position.


                
A classic, psychological thriller with a totally unexpected twist at the end! Diabolique, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, the French master of suspense, stars Michel Delassalle as Paul Meurisse, a sadistic and abusive headmaster, Vera Clouzot as Christina Delassalle, his frail, long suffering wife, and Nicole Horner as Simone Signoret, the bitter 'ex' mistress.Signoret is brilliant as Nicole; sultry, sulky and cynical; she 'chums up' with Vera in a plot to dispense with her husband, a nasty character by all accounts, for whom it is very hard to drum up any compassion. Apparently Diaboliques was the inspiration for Hitchcock's Psycho and one soon sees why. Christina and Nicole are diametrically opposite characters with only one thing in common: their hatred for the malicious and cruel Michel. Christina is decisive and clear about what 'must' be done, Nicole is beaten down, world weary and 'ill', one presumes from the emotional abuse and infidelities she has endured throughout her marriage, and 'flip flops' about their diabolical plan. In the end she is persuaded, and they lure Michel to his demise; tranquilizing and drowning him and then dumping his body in the school swimming pool. It is at this point that the plot seems to have been fulfilled and one can only wait in suspense for Michel's bloated corpse to rise to the top of the pool and for the two women to celebrate their freedom and live out the rest of their days in contentment. However, things aren't as they seem, and when reports and sightings of Michel begin, Christina becomes increasingly paranoid and appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Nicole has no patience for Christina's panic and anxiety and the two argue, threatening to expose each other as the perpetrator of Michel's murder. Has Michel really arisen from the dead as a taunting, vengeful ghost? Is Christina going insane? How can he possibly be alive when we saw him drowned , weighted down by a heavy object, eyeballs bulging, before he dies? And that's where the unexpected and brilliant twist comes in, which I shan't give away because I want the clever suspense and well crafted plot of Les Diaboliques to be enjoyed by all. If you love Psycho, you'll love Diaboliques and you will see why it caused such a sensation upon its release in 1955.
Spoiler? maybe...This is more of a goof on the director, then a spoiler..When the victim is on the bed, he asks his wife to remove his shoes, and we see that she does. Then Simone, as she is running the water in the bathtub, asks the wife to remove his shoes, as she is preparing to carry him into the tub. This time we don't see her doing this. When they carried him into the tub, you can see him still with the shoes on. Other than that goof, a well made suspenseful movie, that outshines Hitchcock. I think there was an American remake which fell far short of this masterpiece.


                
Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Diabolique" is a suspense film based on a novel by collaborators Boileau-Narcejac, best known for writing the novel which formed the basis for Hitchcock's "Vertigo". According to film legend, Hitchcock nearly got his hands on this property too but Clouzot beat him to it. While it's interesting to ponder how the film would have turned out in Hitch's hands there's no denying that Clouzot made the most of his material.The film revolves around a pair of women who plot to kill the man who holds a domineering influence over both of them (Paul Meurisse). The fragile wife (Véra Clouzot) doesn't have the nerve but is pressured into co-operating by the strong-willed mistress (Simone Signoret). The murder goes as planned but when the body disappears it introduces an unexpected element into the proceedings.Both actresses turn in standout performances and Meurisse makes for a fine antagonist. The supporting cast is also good but the film's main claim to fame is its twist ending. While the ending's impact has been dulled somewhat by subsequent imitations the film nevertheless maintains a high degree of suspense throughout. Clouzot's mastery of suspense rivals Hitchcock and you probably won't even realize that he's working without the benefit of a mood-enhancing score.In the end, "Diabolique" emerges as a top-notch suspense film. Even if Hitchcock had gotten his hands on the rights I don't know if he could have done any better. It's unfortunate that the big twist has lost some of its sheen over the years but the film remains thoroughly engaging even today.


                
***SPOILER ALERT** Suffering for both psychical as well as mental abuse form her tyrannical husband Michael Deassalle, Paul Meurisse, his sensitive and very fragile, from a serious heart condition, wife Christina, Vera Clouzot, who owns that boarding school that Michael is the principal of had just about reached her breaking point. That happened when her cheap skate husband forced the students and herself to gulp down the school's lunch menu of spoiled and rotten fish that he got, who else would want it, free of charge from the local fish market. It just happened that Christina's friend Nicole Horner, Simone Signoret, a teacher at the boarding school, and Michael's former mistress, has also reached her limit in putting up with Michael's abuse. The night before Michael in one of his rare moments when he isn't drunk-and can zero in on his target-let her have it with a straight left to he head and ended up giving Nicole a king-or queen-size shiner! Nicole comes up with a plan to finally put the abusive and somewhat unstable Michael out of her-and Christina- as well as his life.Tricking Michael to come to Nicole's place in Niort, some 50 miles away from the boarding school, both Nicole and a very reluctant Christina plan to get him good and drunk on a combination of cheap wine and barbiturates and then drown him in Nicole's bathtub. It's then that the two plan to drive, with Michael's corpse, back to the Delassalle Boarding School and dump him into the school's swimming pool making it look like Mchael got himself smashed and then, being too drunk to see where he's going, fell into it and drowned himself! Everything went perfectly with Michael drowned in Nicole's bathtub and then disposed off, in the school swimming pool, but the next morning Michael's dead body that was supposed to float to the surface is nowhere to be found!Not knowing what to do in Michael being a no-show at his own murder site, the school swimming pool, both Nicole and Christina panic feeling that the very dead Michael has suddenly come back to life to exact holy revenge on them! Or in fact could it be that Michael wasn't killed at all despite being held under water for at least ten minutes by his two murderers! Still this doesn't explain how Michael could have possibly survived being at the bottom of the swimming pool for, what turned out, five whole days! It's when the pool was finally drained and Michael was nowhere to be found that the shock caused his wife Christina to suffer a massive heart-attack that laid her up in bed for almost the entire movie!***MAJOR SPOILERS*** With the former town police commissioner Alfred Fichet, Charles Vanel, showing up at the scene and offering his services to Christina free of charge, if he doesn't get results, to find her missing husband is when things really started popping in the movie. Acting like a French version, some twenty years earlier, of the famed 1970's TV detective Francis, yes that's really his first name, Columbo Fichet had a lot more on the ball then what he lead Christina as well as Nicoel on too. As it turned out the plot to murder Michael was just a cover for something far bigger and more sinister then even Christina and Nichole could have ever imagined! In both its execution and then its backfiring on those who so cleverly concocted it!


                
One cannot imagine a wife (Vera Clouzot) and a mistress (Simone Signoret) knowing each other, much less plotting together to murder the husband (Paul Meurisse), who is abusive, but that is the plot of this thriller that reportedly was snatched from Hitchcock by just 30 minutes. One can imagine it might have been his greatest film, but Henri-Georges Clouzot gets that honor.It's the common case of the wife who has the money, and the abusive husband that is living off her largess, but doing his own thing (think Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook). Nicole (Signoret) is the strong one, and you might even think there are subtle lesbian intentions here. Christina (Clouzot) wavers constantly in her intentions, but a visit from Michel (Meurisse) and more abuse, firms up her resolve.They have a good plan, but something happens when they carry it out. They drown the husband in the bathtub and dump him in the school pool. When the pool is drained, no Michel! Then his suit appears from the dry cleaners. A body shows up in the river the next day.She goes to the morgue to identify him, and meets Colombo. Actually, it is Alfred Finchet (Charles Vanel), but you would swear Peter Falk stole his character from this film. It was not Michel in the morgue! How does this end? The Director requests that we not tell you. But, the last 15 minutes will astound you.


                
I enjoy great movies, and LES DIABOLIQUES is not one of them.  It is a great idea, story, and plot.  But it lacked the needed suspense and mystery, as the only possible solution is too easily figured out minutes into the film. The only real excitement comes in the last fifteen minutes, but it takes you ninety minutes to get there.  Not worth it.Paul Meurisse's acting was dreadful, Vera Clouzot's was only adequate. The exception in all this was Simone Signoret who gives a brilliant performance; the only main character offering any believability, and in her case it was total and absolute.  Watch for Charles Vanel's performance as a "Columbo"-like Inspector Fichet.A good but not great movie, LES DIABOLIQUES is only worth a rental if all the Hitchcock films are already checked out.


                
LES DIABOLIQUES is a spooky and intense classic from France, a psychological thriller in which a pair of women decide to kill a bullying and controlling school headmaster. One of them is his wife, the other his mistress, and both hate him for good reason. Their plot goes to plan but the psychological toll of what they have done weighs heavy on them, compounded by further mystery when the body goes missing.There's very little to dislike about this classic movie which has a sheen of quality to it. The expert direction draws out the suspense of the situation without resorting to jump scares or sinister music; the camera-work is very fine and the slow-moving nature of the narrative allows you to become fully immersed in the realism of the piece. The actors are exemplary, as you would imagine, and the film features some quite wonderful ghastly set-pieces involving corpses rising from baths and the like. That it is still frightening when seen today says plenty.LES DIABOLIQUES is also an influential movie; try watching Hitchcock's PSYCHO and in particular Kubrick's THE SHINING afterwards, you can see this film's fingerprints all over them. The Shaw Brothers studio even went ahead to make their own, even more involved spin on the story, the quite wonderful HEX which turns out to be very nearly every bit as entertaining as this film, albeit in a quite different genre. Horror and thriller fans will be in their element with this outstanding lesson in movie-making.
