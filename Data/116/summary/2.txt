 NOT the Batman film I've been waiting for (Just like that, Marvel wins)

 Horribly disappointing

 Two-Faced Feelings

 I wanted to like it, honestly!

 It could have been better.

 Worst than Cat Woman! If thats possible

 A ham-fisted attempt at morality, and a bad movie to boot

 Batman Begins should change its name to Batman Disappoints.

 what an awful movie

 the end of Batman as you knew it

 "Batman Begins" smells of guano!!

 i fell asleep

 Not Worth Even Watching Once

 The Emperor's New Clothes

 This reminds me of a really big firework..

 If it were meant to be satire, it would be quite good.

 What the heck!

 Yet another Hollywood Let-down

 An average big budget action flick

 It was way worse than i expected

 Spectacularly Bad

 not brilliant

 Overrated

 What I think Of The Driection of Batman Begins

 don't remake great movies
