 The parts were greater than the whole

 Oily

 Good but overrated

 Technically Perfect, but Boring and Without Emotion

 Great acting, but not moving

 There will be Yawns

 Don't believe the hype. Everything you've heard is as exaggerated as the title is misleading.

 there will be no good reason

 Overrated but very interesting nonetheless

 it's good, but oddly unsatisfying

 The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is superb.

 A film that desperately tries to be a masterpiece, but forgets what that means

 Markets more than what it delivers

 very long, story could have been tightened up

 Unusual - Worth Watching

 Greed is not good

 Odd music and even more odd film

 Paul Thomas Anderson's Inferno

 There Will Be Salad Tossing

 Blood runs cold

 Perfect as an art pieces, but so-so as a piece of cinematic entertainment.

 Ehhhhh,,,

 There will be......DANIEL......

 No change here

 A Very Well-Made Film, but No Best Picture
