 I'm probably an outlier on this one: It is well crafted, but predictable

 Respectable effort, but I wished for more depth to the characters, as well as less frustrating character actions!

 Harsh to watch

 War is bad. No, really!

 A Hard Film to Watch

 All around depressing yet it's well executed

 A well done War movie

 great movie, but not hyped too much for me

 Touching but not a classic

 Well worth the view

 I disagree with all the reviewers ! an unnecessary pain

 relentless depression

 A Good Film, In Spite of its Sentimentality

 Human side of war

 I liked it, but not too much

 An Interesting Story, but a Little Unclear and Predictable

 I've never seen its like

 Definitely *Not* "the saddest movie I've ever seen"
