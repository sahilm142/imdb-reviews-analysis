 La-la Land

 NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND (Hayao Miyazaki, 1984) ***

 Eco-warrior!

 An animation that inspires a lot of other movies

 Better Than Average Anime

 One more masterpiece from Hayao Miyazaki...

 One of the Finest Anime of Its Time

 Miyazaki's Early Masterpiece

 Ahead of its time, still poignant Japanimation

 I liked it... but I didn't love it

 A less involving film than expected.

 Science Fiction masterpiece

 Weird, but pleasant.

 An Early Classic - Has It Aged Well?

 Great movie but......

 Amazing animation but too many environmental messages stuffed inside

 Overrated Classic

 A little too long but still very Ghibli!... Worth a look?

 An old jewel with a fresh message

 Bullet With Butterfly Wings
