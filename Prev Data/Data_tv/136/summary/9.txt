 Brilliant and Challenging

 Future Emmy Winning Show

 Interesting characters and moral dilemmas. Excellent.

 Why this show is rated lower than it should be.

 Room filled with News

 Sorkin is brilliant as always, with some room for improvement

 Breathtakingly Awesome

 Absolutely Intriguing

 Amazing

 An Entertaining Show That Makes You Think

 Very well done.

 We just decided to - Episode Review

 Worth a try

 West Wing - Different Setting

 A little over reach

 The Newsroom - A Work in Progress but Starting High.

 Just hate what's between Maggie and Jim

 Great show

 Sports Night seasons 3-5

 Absolutely riveting

 A must watch TV series

 I liked it, so sue me.

 If TV is a recipe...Sorkin is Masterchef

 'Bullies' - BRILLIANT work....

 thank f for this show
