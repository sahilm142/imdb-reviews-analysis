 Pretentious and ponderous, but ultimately very weak

 Climbing on the shoulders of others.

 I dare to call this turd a turd!

 Remake of the 70's classic but fails badly.

 A huge disappointment

 What a load of PC BS

 Melodramatic adolescent pap of no value, depth or significance whatever.

 Badly Written and Badly Shot - Why is this still on the Air?

 Worst "Update" of Classic Television in History

 Ouch!

 Unhealthy aspects of this show requires some thoughts

 I thought I was going to be entertained.... and I was - on how not to make a TV-show

 Quite bad, actually

 So bad I created an account just to warn you

 Trash TV

 Crikey!

 A Triumph of Hype Over Quality

 Talking Points

 A Good Idea Turned Disaster

 These people are very deserving...

 Don't Waste Your Time...

 Fails miserably on its own terms - Scifi should cancel quickly

 This is not Science-Fiction Perhaps Religion-Fiction

 Reminiscent of those teens yelping about "DAAAAHHHHKKKKNEEESSSSSS!!!!!"

 Gave up after watching Episode 7 of Season 1
