Beautiful photography and the commentator has a good voice, but the plot was so exaggerated that it became intolerable. Everything is ultimate: "THE MOST..." dangerous, fatal, life threatening, hostile. Nearly every story had two threads, each obviously scripted to be overly dramatic, and destined to collide.I am sad to see this subject saturated with this content, as it will probably out shadow better alternatives. It was a big letdown compared to other recent BBC nature content.Stopped watching after three episodes, and only kept going for so long because of the excellent photography.
