The series was a landmark in television history and broke a number of taboos and boundaries. And there are scenes which have been and continue to be laugh-inducing, such as "Ypres 1914", "The Ministry Of Silly Walks", and "The Spanish Inquisition".But what really made Monty Python work was mainly not the jokes but the performances. If the actors hadn't been able to play everything straight, the whole thing would have fallen apart. The series depended not just on wit but on silliness and absurdity, which in itself isn't automatically funny. And many of the scenes are dated or funny only to Britons...and some of them are genuinely not funny. But not everything Charlie Chaplin was good either (and I'm talking about his early silent films as well as his late talkies.)


                
It's....."Monty Python's Flying Circus". This show has too many memorable, priceless bits to count - and not a few duds. At their best, the Pythons invented a new language for comedy (and TV): anything goes, anything can happen, at any time and any place. It bends the mind. Perhaps as good a summary of their primary purpose as any can be found in a Graham Chapman line: " we need to cure people of their sanity". But sometimes they take an idea that's not very funny in the first place, and they stretch it out too long. The first two seasons are generally the strongest; the third is also good but more uneven; the fourth is by far the weakest (though it still has its moments) - their hearts and minds were more in the upcoming "Holy Grail" by that time. Objectively speaking, an episode like "Mr. Neutron" is as awful as "The Spanish Inquisition" is brilliant. But my single favorite episode has to be the early "Ant - An Introduction" - don't miss it! *** out of 4 as a whole. P.S. Carol Cleveland - what a WOMAN!
