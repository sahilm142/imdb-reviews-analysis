 Not for everyone...but if it's for you, you'll love it

 A great show

 My favorite show

 Cartoon Network's Crown Jewel for good reason.

 Strange, but Good

 Brilliant show

 Fresh & surprising every time

 A Work of Art

 a fantasy that live up to its name

 Some episodes are better than others but the majority are great

 Far better than I hoped

 Adventure time!

 Welcome to the Land of Ooo!

 Good

 Amazing but not for everyone

 It May Not Be One of the Classics, But It Nevertheless Exeeds Expectations

 I loved this show's characters so much. Precious is the word.

 WTF Did I Just Watch?!

 Mmm

 A very creative cartoon with a fun sense of humour.

 A "Adventure Time" Review

 A brilliant show, though it seems to falter a LITTLE in season 4
