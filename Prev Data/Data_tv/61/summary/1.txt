 Do NOT pass go, do not travel down this "Yellow Brick Road"...

 More genius from the creators of "Homicide: Life on the Street"

 Not only the best show on TV currently, but one of the best shows of all-time.

 Brutal, difficult, uncompromising, unpleasant, unsettling and utterly brilliant

 The most underrated show on tv

 Oz is a great series

 oz The show i've seen from Hbo.

 Promising first season, but did the writers abandon ship?

 Graphic, shocking, brutal...with plenty of bunk.
