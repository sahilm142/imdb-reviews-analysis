 Stunning film with great sense and sensibility ; being compellingly directed by Giuseppe Tornatore

 First half is great, but that's it

 heard great things about this film, but

 Different Versions- significantly different run times

 Entertaining but not on my all time classic movie list

 The magic of the movies

 A Movie-Lovers Film

 A sweet little Italian film

 "There are only ghosts here."

 Celluloid nostalgia

 Movie Magic!

 Cinema Paradiso

 Very original
