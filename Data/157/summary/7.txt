 Emotional and symbolic masterpiece by the genius Ingmar Berman

 Not very impressed

 Farewell, Victor Sjostrom

 Bergman lite

 interesting Film

 The Sweet Smell of Sorrow

 Meticulous and Languid

 The change of a man...

 The road called "life"

 Black and White Bergman.

 Introspection and nostalgia

 Victor Sjostrom, major figure of early European cinema, gives the performance of his career in old age as a man haunted by the past

 Another Bergman Road Movie

 Touches of cruelty

 The road trip of life

 Good, but boring

 Typical Bergman

 Early fruit
