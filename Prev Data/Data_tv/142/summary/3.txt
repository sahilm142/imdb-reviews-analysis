 Movie Sign!

 Excellent! Ranks right up there with "The Simpsons" and "The Daily Show" !

 Should go down in history as one of the greatest shows ever written

 A consistently great show

 One of the Greatest Ideas ever come to TV

 I love it!

 From Trash to Treasure: Rich Genius on a Salvation Army Budget

 My Best TV Friends at the Movies!

 One of the funniest shows around

 The most Intelligent show created by the Imperfect race of Man

 The best comedy series ever.

 Now THIS is funny.

 Originality would be nice.

 Best Cult Show EVER!!

 In my opinion, the greatest thing to ever happen to T.V.

 Right On!!!!

 Tragically cut down in the prime of life.

 Infantile trash.

 What the hell?

 Joel Hodgson is my idol.

 Consistently brilliant, one of the finest shows of our time

 One of the few reasons I watch TV

 Who told these guys they're funny?
