This is A Film of A Conservative Man Who Is Stuck In The Past - Unlike Harold Lloyd who was open-minded and progressive and who eagerly produced his first talkie in 1929 - Chaplin continued to live in his fantasy world of the past and released a silent film in 1931 which could have been made in 1890 - The Synchronized Score could well have been replaced with a violin playing "Hearts And Flowers" because the story is as interesting as a revival of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" I give this a 1 - Don't bother watching this film - read a good book instead.
