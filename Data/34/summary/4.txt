 2nd rate melodrama, unbelievably overrated..

 a preachy self-important mess

 Weak Movie............About A Strong Subject

 So much hate, so much anger

 Well meaning but poorly made

 What a disappointment!

 Extremely simplistic

 YET ANOTHER HIGHLY OVERRATED FILM

 Are you serious

 Left-wing racial propaganda

 A Good Movie that was almost great
