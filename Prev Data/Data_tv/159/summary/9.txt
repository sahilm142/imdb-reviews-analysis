 Ignore the Blind Patriots Reviews

 Things we saw

 Rises above the anchors of patriotism and nationalism to deliver facts

 Untold, as in "never told this way"

 Great Doc Series So Far....

 100 Years of Megalomania

 Brilliantly Done Revisionist History

 gives you enough to mentally chew on to revisit - where there's smoke there's fire

 A Little Closer Look

 Untold History is a breath of fresh air, but it's not as daring as some of Stone's earlier works.

 Interesting Point Of View

 My rating: 9

 i think Oliver Stone is one of best man i had ever known. he looking to the world with completely open eyes.

 Excellent ..
