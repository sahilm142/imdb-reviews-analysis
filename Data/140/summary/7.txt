 An enjoyable watch

 Beautiful but Nothing New

 Cliché almost overcome by professionalism

 GUESS WHO'S DRIVING MR. DAISY TO CHRISTMAS DINNER?

 I think this movie be different about racism

 Innocent and warming

 It was OK

 Two commanding central performances.

 Phenomenal tale of hope and empowerment

 A Charming and Well-Acted Film!

 A fine performance by Mortensen, but an underdeveloped script

 Everyone Can Learn Something From Everyone

 Over the top

 Driving Miss Daisy with a slightly different prespective

 Decent, enjoyable but standard prestige film based on a true story

 comedy within a scary era

 Reverse Driving Miss Daisy meets Big Bang Theory with social commentary

 The hilarious and heartwarming character dynamic is what works best here

 Good, but déjà vu

 Superb first half; unnecessarily long, moralistic and schmaltzy second half
