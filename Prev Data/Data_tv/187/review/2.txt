I have been waiting for the return of Spartacus: Blood and Sand for quite some time now. Unfortunately, Andy's cancer delayed this for a long time, so Starz gave us Gods of the Arena in stead.All I can say is well done! We are introduced into the same society and atmosphere we were presented in Blood and Sand, but a few years before Spartacus's arrival. Most of the cast from the previous show is back, and the producers did a good job with making them look a bit younger. I will not give out the names, to avoid spoilers, but rest assured, you will not be disappointed by the number of familiar faces.And, most importantly, everything that we've seen in Blood and Sand is here! All the gore, sex, and ruthlessness is back, and boy, I've missed it. Seeing the first episode of the new series, I had a sense of seriousness and ambition throughout the show. There is enough action to keep you entertained, but there are also plenty of sensual scenes and political schemes as well. The cast did a good job, as always, and I did not have the feeling that the actors lost interest since the first season, a thing that happens with lots of shows nowadays. Also, the special effects have gotten a little better, the filming is great too.So, as a bottom line, Starz and it's Spartacus is back, just as strong as the old series, even if Spartacus himself is missing, for now. If you loved the previous show, you will love this too, no doubt, and if you didn't, well, you will start loving it now!


                
By Jupiter's rooster! I'd be willing to wager coin that many a skeptic became a believer upon viewing the premier of "Spartacus: Gods of the Arena". From the opening moment to the final credits I could not gaze in another direction. The brilliant writing combined with outstanding performances and great visuals come together to produce what will no doubt become legend. The depiction of a world with honor among slaves and dishonor among their masters is masterful. The portrayal of a world which doesn't require the web or mass media for it's inhabitants to be exposed to every depravity and brutality known to humanity is enthralling. A better adrenaline rush could only be found by those living in such a world. A must see for connoisseurs of sex and violence. Mere mortals could do worse than vowing patronage to "Spartacus: Gods of the Arena". Never was a more visceral experience produced by a succession of images on an HD screen combined with surround sound!


                
There were many skeptics leading into this new season (not technically season 2) of "Spartacus: Gods of the Arena", many feared it would not be worth watching without Andy Whitfield. For those with concerns, here is some advice: watch it! The major antagonist was lost from the previous season, but the character depth/story of the new leading actor is building AND new depths of past characters from "Spartacus: Blood and Sand" are unveiled. The history of how they developed is fascinating. The relationship differences between the two season are significant, thus there is a huge void of curiosity leftover to reveal how they developed to become the personalities they portrayed in season 1.It would be remiss to leave out the absolute, succulent gratuity that peaks our senses! The world is enriched with beautiful people, outstanding wardrobes cast in a time that fascinates most, the Roman Empire. Did I mention that many of these beautiful people are quite revealing? Nudity! It is with taste I might add! Of course, references to porn are made, but no porn has the character depth and sophistication that gives the sexual scenes the passion that is conveyed in this series. The necessity to produce these scenes is important in fostering the time-period's stance of sexual openness. The costume range is great; the rich are adorned with lavish jewelry and a colorful, flowing wardrobe which is artistically chosen, and for the poor, well sometimes they are left with nothing. The gladiators are especially left without much clothing, but the armor they do wear is often demonic, intimidating and everything you would naturally expect to find on a person when they are fighting to the DEATH! The fight scenes are well choreographed and blood is everywhere! The array of weapons to choose from, the differences in fighting styles, the varying levels of fighting skill all make for interesting battles in the arena. Also, bear in mind that the arena is not only for physical fighting, but the political fold is the pressing force behind the fights. Basically, it is more than just a fight, what you see is not entirely what you get. The fight's value is difference for the gladiator, than it is for the crowd, than it is for the owner's of the gladiators; and, these differences are excellently contrasted. The graphics are not top-notch, but it adds a stylistic element to the show. The blood is vibrant and sometimes seems to defy physics--it's great! The acting is intense and the director seems to strive away from being "natural" which is good. The intensity is not monochromatic and individual to each characters personality.In a short and sweet summary, this gratuitous mash of beautiful people, fight scenes, political undertones is nothing short of brilliant. Watch it for what it is and you will not be disappointed.


                
As all of you probably know this is a prequel to Spartacus: Blood and Sand. I assume it is such because of Andy Whitfield's ongoing battle with cancer. Although harsh sounding as it may be, during the first episode you barely miss him. This is not because of anything other than the fact that it is a prequel and we all hope he will return for future seasons.The episode was well thought out and gives real insight into the beginnings of certain characters from the first season. After waiting for so long (or what seemed like an eternity), I was definitely not disappointed with what looks like is going to be another great season.Definitely do not miss!


                
guys nobody is recognizing the role of batiatus.....i see no single comment mentioning about him....it is he who played long duration in all the episodes....and with his performance, has brought life to spartacus TV series...he was the one with highest dialogues in the serial, but he never made us feel bored of his role either in blood and sand or gods of the arena....he really showed us a true lanista......i agree that all the actors performed to their best.Anyways its a great entertainer for our period showing us about the lifestyle during the period of gladiators.I really love the politics in this series especially those played by lucretia and batiatus together in both blood and sand and also gods of the arena.....i really bow before the dialogue writer particularly for the phrase 'jupitor's c**k' during the scenes of frustration..


                
Wow. I absolutely loved the first season of Spartacus and was so sad to hear of Andy getting cancer. I didn't think the show could continue without him. I was proved wrong by the first ten minutes of Gods of the Arena. The actor portraying Gannicus is instantly likable and I actually like him more than Spartacus. Spartacus is mostly melodramatic while Gannicus is just an egotistical cocky bad ass. By the second episode, the writers do such an excellent job that you actually care deeply for these characters and the horrors they face. Episode 3 went almost too far in the portrayal of the brutality of Rome. I just watched episode 4, and am still reeling at the awesomeness. The writing on this show is completely unrivaled, and they do not ever sacrifice reality for taste. The character development and raw emotion in them is so well portrayed through not only excellent writing, but insanely good acting. I will say that especially this season is not for the faint hearted, but if extreme gore, profanity, nudity, and VERY mature themes are not a problem for you then you simply must watch this show!


                
wow. For those who feared this would be a let down without the original lead actor please put such thoughts aside. This prequel seems better than the first season! I'd suggest they have learned some valuable lessons in the first series.The plot is more complex and more gripping than before. The actors play their roles perfectly. I think the direction / camera work has improved slightly as well.The writing / dialogue is outstanding. I was gripped from start to finish. I cant wait for the next episode and to see how this season finishes. I wonder what season 3 will be? is andy better and able to continue? whatever happens I hope it carries on for a long time to come.


                
I enjoyed Blood and Sand, but as a guilty pleasure. Outrageous sex and violence, some truly terrible dialogue and dodgy acting from Kiwi accented muscle men. It was fun, but not gripping nor truly addictive.I was happy to sit back and enjoy more of the same, but Gods of the Arena is a major evolution.There's less blood (although still more that any other show, ever) and less sex (likewise) , but far more dastardly pots and intrigue. The dialogue is more Shakespearian and the accents are reigned in. A (small) dose of Deadwood has gone a long way to making this show a cult classic. I hope they keep making these.


                
I wrote a number of individual episode reviews of Blood & Sand. I was frankly blown away, it was not merely some of the best entertainment I had ever seen, it was in a class by itself, a sort of take-no-prisoners approach to TV drama. (Sorry for the bad pun) I spent time with this second season, packaged as a prequel, because of the excellent reviews.I agree ... but I don't.First of all, in my reviews of B&S I did indeed commend the performance of Hannah on multiple occasions. He is superb.But to me this season speaks to the star power of Whitfield. It is generally acknowledged that, if not for his unfortunate circumstances, a career upgrade was in store. He was not merely the star, he was also the draw, the glue, the eyes through the audience learnt to evaluate the story, scene by scene in real time. Every time he approached Hannah and said "Dominus" part of the fun was guessing what he really wanted to say,,, That is missing here. The truth hurts. Without Whitfield, you have an above average production. With him, you had a great one.


                
What's wrong with enjoying in something shallow? This Gods of the Arena is unplanned for and is meant only to bridge till they do the second season, for tragic causes... Only thing annoying enough to take the 10th star is that slaves are speaking deep thoughts in short sentences and wise manner... even more so than their masters! I like the brutality in all the fights, sex and lies! That's probably how ancient societies were, specially Rome. I truly cannot wait to see next season, and this one, however different from the first, is just a way to keep us interested in the series. So, do not be too picky of it's quality. I wanted to keep this review shorter but I could not, since I like to support easy watching series as I find it much more satisfying to ease my mind by watching TV than to watch something of what I will think next two days.


                
I really don't like violence in movies or series..this show has plenty of it as well as nudity but somehow I enjoy the show.I think cast is well selected.Especially John Hannah is outstanding actor.I couldn't think anybody else in this role.Special effects are not very realistic but action never stops so you don't care about these unrealistic effects.At the final of the each episode, you say don't make this to me ,don't end in here and one week passes with thinking what is the next..second season of Spartacus: Blood and Sand will be next year.we have to wait too long ..I'm already looking forward to it..Go Gladiators!


                
Spartacus: GotA is a lot more complex than people think it is. I believe that the bigger amount of sex and violence make people not to focus as much as they should in the environment of the series.The dialogs are great, the theming is awesome (you can believe you are at the very Roime!) and acting is decent. These things make the series a lot better than just some muscular guys turning into pieces others and some naughty sex scenes.Let's be honest: the stuff presented is not really mind-blowing, but it's really entertaining, and that's the purpose of every good series. So let's be fair and stop seeking Schwarzenegger's neurons, we will not find them, we better enjoy the show the way it is.


                
What can I say? The acting, directing, screenplay (script) are some of the best I've ever seen. A cast of unknowns that act soo well it makes you feel as if you are really there. I looked up Gladiators on wikipedia and realized that the names, Towns, clothing, and real life stories in this series actually existed... I was shocked that the makers of the series really stuck to the actual events that took place and didn't just "make things up". This brings a sense of realism to the show which heightens the drama and the over all story. If you wanted "Thee" actual gladiator film or series, then this and "Blood and Sand" are "it". The era of Rome's gladiators (slaves) from the 1st century (which fought to the death) has never been depicted so well by any other movie or TV series that I have ever seen and i've seen them all. I have seen other comments like "HBO's Rome was better". "Rome" isn't about gladiators or the view point of the slave's lives. There's really no argument in comparing the two. Twists, turns, politics, loyalty and betrayal are all put to the test in "Spartacus Gods of the Arena". This series is "heavy on sex and violence" but has an excellent story and 3 dimensional characters everywhere. You will feel compassion for some characters and hate others with a vengeance. When a series can make you feel such emotions then in my opinion it's an absolute winner. Entertainment that's off the charts! "It just doesn't get any better than this folks"!


                
I was truly amazed to see that this gets 9,2 at IMDb, I was expecting 3,2 or something. It is really one of the most appalling shows I have seen. The only thing that is done professionally is blood splattering around in slow motion. For the rest it is pure garbage.The acting is basically absent. People appear to read lines of semi-ancient English from autocue or, more frequently, they just grunt. The story is about herds of gladiators killing each other, and their masters also killing each other. With some sex thrown in for good measure. The language verges on the absurd, with all the faux ancient English with four letters words thrown in.I can understand some people would still want to watch this. I can only watch it for a laugh, except it's not funny for more than one minute.


                
In my opinion Spartacus: Gods of the Arena crushes the first season in it's ability to draw me in, and keep me on the edge of my seat anxiously awaiting the next episode. It being a prequel season showing how the dynamics of each individual character came about was a wonderful idea. You get a more in depth look at every character; Asher seems even more devious, you see Batiatus when he's still a vulnerable young man rather than the Lanista on top of the world, and of course seeing Crixus the undefeated Gaul start from nothing. On top of how the season portrayed old characters it also did an AMAZING job in it's induction of new characters. Gannicus quickly became my favorite character in the show. He fights arguably the best, he has this cocky attitude about himself because he knows he's the best and yet he has a down to earth sentimental side that when the words leave his mouth they just stay in my head. He gives many lines I feel people should be living their lives by. My favorite being, "There are many things given to us in this life for the wrong reasons. What we do with such blessings, that is the true test of a man". This season although only being 6 episodes, (not even half of it's comparable seasons) has I would estimate an equal amount of surprising twists. Many times a character will go from being the lowest of the low face in the dirt, and by next episode they've stabbed someone in the back or made a deal that gets them to the top. If anyone was on the fence about watching/buying this season I give a whole hearted YES that you should watch it. This season was my favorite of the best show I believe has ever been aired. They wouldn't have even made this season if it wasn't for the original man who played Spartacus (Andy Whitfield) being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They started this season in hopes that it would give time for Andy to get better and hopefully return for the next season. Unfortunately life had different plans and Andy Whitfield died shortly after the season ended. Never forget where it all started, and honor the true Bringer of Rains! R.I.P. Andy Whitfield


                
Spawned from Spartacus' c**k comes shows like 'Game of Thrones' and the like. But SPARTACUS really raised the bar and kicked the ladder out from under it! This is pure entertainment. The blood/gore/sex/nudity level is cranked up to level '10', but the storyline is one that sticks with you forever. The characters are all fleshed out a lot more in 'GOA' than 'BAS', so we know how Crixus became Champion of Capua, how Oenomaus became Doctore, how Batiatus rose to power, we meet the extremely sexy Gaia! - but most importantly, we are introduced to Gannicus - Possibly the most talented and charismatic of all champions (really? blindfolded?!) Charming, playful, and absolutely deadly with two swords (or without any!), Gannicus actually made me forget about Spartacus not being there. All the characters are well written and of the course the dialogue is memorable and a lot of times laugh out loud hilarious! ("Once again the Gods see fit to shove c**k in a**!") hahahahah LOVE IT! Never been a show like this in the history of TV and anything after will be a copycat. Truly a Starz ORIGINAL!
I really like this TV show too much, after the Blood and Sand, it brings me elsewhere, keeps me away from real world crap.Blood and Sand was perfectly provide the meaning of the name of the TV-show, it was include too much blood and too much sand. It was satisfy me by its fights. But not the Gods of the Arena for now, it is full of intrigue and full of wheeler-dealing and too much sex. I admit that sex puts TV-show to a new level. It brings energy to the series, because "Roman discovered the sex and the world enjoyed it." right? It provides the idea thats the fact but by the side of this I WANT TO SEE THE FIGHTS ALRIGHT?. I want to lose myself with the struggles of Spartacus like the way i do with the first season. I see only sex and the perfect transitions(the passings between scenes)and the perfect visual effects, they are really remarkable, i really admire the whole transitions, i watch them repeatedly. I hope that TV-show never ends, because the television world needs that kind of quality TV-shows.


                
Firstly I don't write reviews, no matter how much I like/hate any show, though I enjoy reading reviews but I feel I should write a review about this show. I was recently introduced to Spartacus season one, I loved the show, the actors, the actresses everything was top-notch. I mean nothing comes close to Spartacus, Lucy lawless is goddess, People say this show would be nothing without Andy, I don't agree. THIS SHOW IS NOTHING WITHOUT LUCY. Once Lucy is done with the show, this show will fall apart.This first show was shot very well, good body show. I feel showing body is a very integral part of this show with the blood of course and yeah the first episode delivered the expectations and I am looking forward to watch this season. I am sure this gonna be one helluva series, I am sad this is a short one but at least we got something good bodies/actors/story to watch other than the stupid reality shows on TV. The blood is too much I agree, but who cares I love it and I love the show and I hope Spartacus is here to stay and stay for long.I just cant get enough of this show. Perfecto.Cheers-


                
If you are of a sensitive nature, then give this, the latest in the 'Spartacus' TV series, the body-swerve. But if you enjoy lots of chiselled male bodies, plenty of both gender nudity, lots of CG gore and aren't offended by some of the bawdiest language ever put into a TV programme, then Spartacus; Gods of the arena, is for you. Neatly tied in carefully with a brief intro (the finale of the last series, Spartacus, Blood and sand) the story whisks us straight into the early days of the house of Bateatus as the scheming Roman builds his gladiatorial house against all the politicking and sexual shenanigans of the vicious and cut-throat world around him. There can't be many sentences where 'cock' is not used, and f**k is thrown about liberally too - as I say, not for the easily shocked, but Chaucerian in its vulgarity! And the reference to Shakespeare? There can equally be few TV programmes where characters say lines like, "He arrives. Let us end discussion and set mind to purpose..." Straight out of Shakespeare for fifth year! So, yes, an eminently suitable successor to Blood and Sand, and will not disappoint the same audience. I feel a need to give it a thumbs up - and let it live for longer to carry on the games!


                
Spartacus second season is not as good as the first one, but is still very entertaining, if you enjoy as I do this sort of overcharged pulp. The first season brilliantly ended with Spartacus and his fellow gladiators rising up and massacring their master Batiatus and escaping to become fugitives. The illness of star Andy Whitfield (regrettably, he ended up dying of cancer soon after) changed the plans of the producers, and instead of making a regular second season following Spartacus exploits as a rebel leader, they choose a short six episode prequel. The action takes place some years before Spartacus arrival in town, and we see how the upcoming Batiatus rises up to become the top lanista in Capua, against his main rival in the gladiator business, the very evil Tullius (Stephen Lovatt, who is great). To achieve this, he will rely, among others, on his top gladiator, Gannicus (Dustin Clare), originally bought to Tullius at a bargain price, as well as in Crixus and the trainer Oenomaus (the last two, seen in the first season).If Batiatus seemed quite a mean man in the first season, here we see him fight against an even meaner man, Tullius, so we sort of end up sympathizing with him. For something that for obvious reasons was rushed into production, the script is rather good. As with the first season, Gods of the Arena is full of graphic violence and sex filmed with relish. A problem with the second season, in my opinion, is that Gannicus is not as an interesting character as Spartacus (we don't have much of a background story on him), so the focus of the season is on Batiatus, and actor John Hannah does not disappoint. While the machinations between the two masters are great, what is lacking is something as interesting in the sand.


                
I became faithfully addicted to Spartacus and was eager to see what Starz had up its sleeve in light of Andy Whitfield (Blood and Sand's Spartacus) and his health diagnosis. And a prequel, though it didn't buy them enough time to see Andy better, was still a fantastic idea.The ludus of the great Batiatus is much different than when we first see it in "Blood and Sand". The great father that Quintus talks about yet lives and you see the great Doctore as the former champion of Capua, Oenomaus, and the mighty Crixus is but a slave trying to win even the mark of the Brotherhood. It is interesting how Quintus and Lucretia are different in situation and attitude you get the chance to see how they become the strong house they are when they are introduced in the Season 1 of Spartacus.Pay attention closely though! Things that were mentioned or referenced in Spartacus: Blood and Sand are brought up and dealt with here in this series. You will also find yourself loving characters that may have been despised before! The language seems less elevated (though that may be simply being used to the way they spoke from season 1) but no expense has been spared in the quality of this show! It will leave you asking yourself one question: Who do I love better? Spartacus? Or Gannicus? Gannicus clearly shines through the series as being a man who doesn't care about his elevated status or have an actual purpose. As Spartacus has eyes for revenge and to see his wife, Sura, Gannicus just slides on by as what most people call as a slacker. Not required to practice much, rewarded well with wine and women and is highly desired all over Capua. A very different type of hero. But you will find you loving his bad and defiant attitude and his story. Perhaps we shall see Dustin Clare as Gannicus yet again in the seasons of Spartacus yet to come!
I mostly enjoyed the original Spartacus movie as it was historical truth. The first "Spartacus: Blood and Sand" was also the same story and was mostly historically correct. Given the freedom of its cable broadcast it was pretty profane, with graphic sex scenes and much use of the the four letter f**k word. This latest rendition in "Gods of the Arena" is just nothing but f**k and very graphic sex. As usual it is sick in its depiction in slow motion of throats slashed, arms severed and blood spurting all over. It's more like the modern video games being pushed where murder, mutilation and mayhem substitute for any true artistic skill or value. The use of profanity reminds me of 14 year old boys who have discovered the f word and use it mercilessly. These writers are the same 14 year old boys. I would much prefer better plot and character development versus falling back every five minutes on nudity and sex and the f word every other second. Basically, this Spartacus is not fit for viewing by any person with intelligence above that of a rock.
It's hard to put this series in a category. It has great action and fighting scenes, beautiful (and surprisingly skilled!) actors, good visual effects, good directing and camera movement, fair historical accuracy, a lot of blood and lots of artistic sex scenes. The second season does a great job in building the plot from the first season. I always found the idea of all the slaves rallying with Spartacus against their master to be somewhat forced. The second season shows, among other things, the facts of life that slowly build the hatred of the slaves towards Battiatus. What is nothing to the masters means the world to the slaves. It's entertainment like you have never seen, but not for the faint-hearted.And one final thing: this film has a lot of touching moments that will make your eyes wet. The story reeks of the slaves' desire for freedom, though the word is barely mentioned in the last episode. Freedom haunts the gladiators like a ghost; it's not wavered like a flag (like in Braveheart). The expectations are high for the 3rd season.


                
There is more nudity than needed, it is very entertaining as you see the rise and fall of the gladiators and the house they represent. The show is very close to porn at times(men and women fully nude) so if you do not wish to see that sort of thing don't watch. The seen are bloody, and gruesome it is full of action. There isn't much left to imagination. I like the story and the wording used by the actors. There is a lot of cursing, to much I believe but effective. Remember the time frame this picture represents were gold rules he who has the gold has the power. The actor John Hannah part is done very well I wait to see what he will do next. It is easy to know what, but in what means will he do it.


                
This is called Spartacus, but it's the back story to Season 1 of the popular Starz show. I'm assuming that you're reading this after you have watched at least Season 1 of the "real" Spartacus show! While this plays before the events of the other seasons, you get treated at a "previously" segment before this series starts. Which means its major spoil alert if you watch this first.Having warned enough, you should be aware that this tells us the story of Crixus and other members of the House Batiatus. It is really great watching it, bringing forth another memorable Gladiator, in the name of Gannikus. The treatment of Blood and nudity is the same as before and you will get more than enough of it. A really good show that has more to offer than the skin/violence some reduce it to. Not to everyone's taste obviously (as many threads on IMDb show), the Drama works and has brought Starz (channel) on the TV map.
