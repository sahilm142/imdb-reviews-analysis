 Tough to put on film but came out very well

 Great One

 Magnificent epic

 My Visit To The Cinema

 A Second Look, With Subtitles In Parts, Made This Much Better

 Possibly the best Middle Chapter Ever

 An excellent addition to the series

 The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...

 What Was I Waiting For?

 A Shout Out to WETA!!! Truly Awesome!

 Best 2nd part to a trilogy ever

 Compelling

 My favorite of the trilogy!

 Peter Jackson does it again, pure screen magic!

 It's the middle child of the movie.

 Another fantasy marvel

 The best fantasy series gets a follow-up

 Upholding

 Gripping, Spellbinding, Enthralling, Mesmerizing ...

 A film for our time.

 Not as good as "Fellowship", but still excellent.

 One of the greatest movies ever made but the best of the Lord Of The Rings.

 The Ultimate fantasy adventure part 2 of 3

 Slowest but almost as best as the first

 Obligatory part 2, not on par with part 1 and 3 but still great
