I was recommended "Black Books" from a colleague. I had never heard about it prior to that, so I found a great bargain on Amazon and purchased the DVD boxed set.And it was with some expectation that I sat down to watch it. And I must admit that my expectations were more than fulfilled. "Black Books" is a great British comedy show, much in the likes of "Father Ted", "Fawlty Towers" or "Black Adder". If you enjoy the witty and often twisted British humor, then you will definitely enjoy "Black Books".I am not going to go too much into details here, as there are 18 episodes to the three seasons. But to summarize it, then Bernard Black (played by Dylan Moran) owns and runs a small and less than tidy book store named "Black Books". Bernard is a drunkard who hates life and even more so hates the customers that come to annoy him in his store. His long time friend Fran (played by Tamsin Greig) runs a store next to the book store and stop by for chats and often ill-gotten advice. To help him with his financial problems, Bernard hires a strange man named Manny (played by Bill Bailey).Now, most of the entire show is centered around these three main characters, and the people hired to play these roles not only did good jobs in portraying these strange and lovable characters, but they also carried the show very well on their shoulders. Throughout the various episodes you will see some familiar faces in the supporting roles, such as Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and David Walliams.The dialogue in "Black Books" is the typical satirical and hilarious dialogue you'd find in many other British comedies. There is nothing sacred here and nothing is barred.The episodes are fun and well put together, for an overall great enjoyment and amusement."Black Books" is a definite must watch for all fans of the British comedy genre.
