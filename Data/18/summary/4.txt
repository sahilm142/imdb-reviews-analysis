 I know this will be unpopular

 This movie took the Blue Pill

 This isn't the "One"

 Its really not that good.

 Cult movie? Not really.

 mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched

 Overrated, overrated, overrated!!

 Overrated as hell.

 Overrated ... and boring

 All Effects and No Story

 not sure what all the hype is about.

 ZZZZZZZ

 Nice mood piece, but really big plot holes.

 Before I die...

 worth every cent I paid (I saw it for free)

 Disappointing

 Sheeesh!

 Disappoints upon reflection

 A bit of a disappointment

 Stupid movie with good action

 Did I see a different movie?

 I'm in the minority

 good effects, stale acting

 1999's Most Over-hyped Motion Picture

 Boring......
