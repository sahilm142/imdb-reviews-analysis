 Winner: Worst Police Work on Film

 Worst movie I've seen this year.

 Unfortunate to watch this movie

 What a waste of time and brains

 Disappointing

 It Takes A Lot of Work.

 Could have been good - and turns into a complete failure

 Shitty movie

 Gross and illogical

 Denis Villeneuve did better with "Incendies"

 The trailer say it all. However a movie about kidnapping children's from ideal family living a quiet life at the suburbs

 tedious

 What a let down.

 Overrated as f***
