I'm sorry, but I just will never understand what the big deal about this show was. It's bland, pretentious, repetitive, mean-spirited, and just not funny. I simply don't see the point of a sitcom with no character development. Why would I revisit a show every week if nothing ever happened? The characters never learn anything, they never change, and they only get more narcissistic and cruel to each other as the show goes on. I refuse to believe that people really think that the world is like this. People are good and have the capacity to be truly altruistic. We're not all a bunch of cheap-ass narcissists living in New York. I would explain my dislike for the show further, but it would be a waste of breath, as my statements would only fall on deaf ears of the droves of sheep who worship at the altar of the holy Seinfeld.


                
This show stinks! It is not funny. It is not entertaining. It is not nothing. It will never be funny. Not even a smile. It is so stupid. Think God the show is finally off the air. Worst comedy every mad! Jerry Seinfeld is not even funny. His jokes are lame. Jerry Seinfeld is one of the worst comedians ever!


                
I have no idea why this show ever had a following.The four lead characters are whiny and self-obsessed and care nothing about anything or anyone but themselves, not even each other. It's hard to choose who is the most obnoxious.It amazes me that this mess lasted so many seasons when other, better shows have come and gone in as little as 3 episodes.The one brilliant thing about the show is that someone had the foresight to shoot it on film, in PANAVISION, in wide screen format knowing that HDTV was in development in the 1990s and that the re-runs would be more appealing in syndication when remastered and re-released in the HD format.EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND also started shooting in HD early on in 1999, after its first three seasons when almost no one had an HDTV.
