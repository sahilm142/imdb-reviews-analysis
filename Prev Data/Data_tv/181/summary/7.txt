 Intriguing tech mystery--can't wait for more

 The good, the bad, and the ugly

 Was best series ever, until Season 2

 Adventures in an inner monologue

 Ideology

 TERRIBLE main character

 i loved first season,but 2 and 3 seasons was poop.and now i hate this show and i have no desire to continue this show

 Season 1 left me wanting more, Season 2 left me not wanting to finish

 Investigative Physiological thriller using corporate IT as a Backdrop

 Great Pilot episode the rest of it is kind of a mess

 Not Bad, But a Little Overrated. Also, The Characters are Not Compelling

 Breaking Binary

 Dudes, Please.

 Yes, it is good, but owes too much to Fight Club

 Disappointing.

 Things that I did not like about Mr. Robort.

 Has potential, but get the Tech right.

 As the wife said - started out great, then disappointed.

 Intriguing story line...but goes off the rails as you watch the episodes

 reminds me of Fight Club movie

 Strong pilot, very poor second and third episode

 love it, but the narrative of modern America is patently false

 Well written but please kill the narration.

 You need a technology consultant

 "Fight Club" for people who know little about IT (the TV series)
