 Oh, Fight Club, you almost had me there

 Fight Club and Calvin and Hobbes

 Pretty Good - But Not Great

 Stylish pitch-black comedy keeps winning die-hard sham-rager fans but is no answer to what ails them.

 Points for Creativity

 This movie is overrated

 110 Minutes of Pure Greatness, but alas...

 I still gave it a "7"

 A good film; NOT a great film.

 Engaging and perplexing

 Great Films Club for Fight Club.

 Stunning film which needs a second watching

 #1 Rule About

 Beautiful, yet underwhelming

 A complex, stylish film overrated in its uniqueness

 Classic? Are You Sure?

 with over 3,000 reviews, this movie does NOT need another

 A memorable, iconoclastic, disturbing film

 Sorprendente ma non credibile

 Is there some deep meaning I'm not getting?

 Overrated

 Truly Unique Film

 Strange and surreal movie

 Fight Club delivers a deep message even though many might not see it.

 Laugh Fest...
