 A Great Series Betrayed In Continuation

 Great yet Uber violent 1st season. 2nd season is a mess.

 Brutal, tragic, and violent

 A series being both violent and romantic, with different ending solutions

 "Does this look like the work of a deadman?"

 Ms Whigham has a bright future...

 Netflix, Re-Consider Bringing Back The Punisher for a Season 3!

 Brutal, violent but a bloody good time nonetheless!

 This one had reasonable and close-to-real life stories and the best fight scene.

 Kinda like Person of Interest, but minus the AI and abstaining from killing... and crime investigation

 savage!

 Terrible follow up

 Relevant and connected plot and shows great promises.

 Kinda lost something...

 A true capture of The Punisher's character

 Punishment

 One Batch, Two Batch . . .

 Great kickarse show, but the top review is misleading, also not suitable for young audiences

 Good show though it drags at times

 awesome

 The Punisher is raw, violent and real; better than expected

 Brutal realism and social commentary on military life

 What's the difference bewteen revenge and justice?

 Almost Perfect

 The Punisher setting down the unmarked path to redemption
