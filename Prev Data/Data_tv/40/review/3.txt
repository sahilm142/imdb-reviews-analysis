I had watched about 50 episodes of Seinfeld and after seeing the reviews here I decided to watch some more in case I was missing something! I can honestly say that Seinfeld is one of the most annoying people I have ever seen on TV and not funny at all. There are about 2 or 3 scenes that just make me crack a smile but that is not enough. I can accept what many people say, that it is different than all the other shows but being different doesn't necessarily mean that it is good. This is one of those cases! I can still enjoy many shows of the 90's and 80's today and laugh every time I watch them, but this show is just awful.


                
This show could have been funny
this show could have been groundbreaking
this show could have been the icon that all future comedy is held up tobut it failed
and why did it fail?terrible, horrendous castingthe kramer character and the elaine character are slimy and unlikeable, tearing down each scene to some unbearable torment straight from new york city hellin real life, kramer would have no friendsin real life, no one would even talk to elaine
