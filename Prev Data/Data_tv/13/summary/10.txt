 The best in animated storytelling...

 A Statement On Perfection. True Unequaled Bliss.

 I just rewatched the best TV series in the history of the world

 A great show for Nick, and it's about time!

 The best show Nickelodeon has aired

 Everyone should watch this, and if you don't, you're a monster

 Best Cartoon on Television

 I could never forget.

 Easily one of (if not THE) greatest animated shows of our time.

 Not just for kids

 Not just for kids

 The one show/piece of art that hasn't and never will be topped by anything.

 Finally, some decent American programming. It's been too long.

 An incredibly good show?

 It's 2018 and I still watch this show

 A show I will rewatch forever

 Just Watch It!

 One of the most fantastic shows ever created

 This is the best!

 Unforgettable

 to this day one of the best TV shows out there

 Satisfyingly Well-Rounded

 Still Amazing

 Not just a kids' show
