 How is this movie receiving critical acclaim?

 Squandered Potential / Anyone who rated this film above a 4 has lost all credibility as a film critic

 A Sizzling Pile of Poo

 Fair story that lost it by going all liberal.

 A condescending, disjointed embarrassment to middle America...

 Desperate

 Nasty and Ugly

 I lost brain cells watching this

 This is an uneven, disturbing mess

 Pure Propaganda, Pure Garbage

 Monster circus art house movie in a disguise of quality drama

 Excuse me ??? what ???

 Three Blillboards: American Cinema in Crisis

 Awful from beginning to end

 Tired of political preaching

 Tedious garbage masquerading as art.

 Postmodernism soup

 Immoral to the Core

 Anything Above A 3 Is INSANE

 A contrived attempt at exorcising the American dream.

 Fargo vs "The Formula"

 For those that hated the film and are petrified by these good reviews

 Awards? Really!!??

 How does this have so much praise?

 Transparent political troll with a crude plot
