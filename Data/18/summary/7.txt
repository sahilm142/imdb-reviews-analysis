 Life in reality

 A bit overhyped, but with lasting influence

 Keanu versus Philip K. Dick

 Too much action, too many stunts...yet still an interesting story idea.

 I don't care what anybody says, this is nothing original.

 Good but not "The Greatest Film Ever Made"

 A movie made by nerds, made for nerds

 I despise this film more than anything else.

 An above average score for an above average film.

 very cool

 Tedium Beyond Belief

 Koia Ali

 Landmark fantasy movie-making

 Unique

 From a deep psychological thriller to a keenu reeves action movie

 A lot of running but the blade is not that sharp

 Hm.

 Good First Time You See It

 Film assumes you are an idiot but excellent action

 Challenges your ability to follow a storyline. *** out of ****

 Hard to be original....

 Still just as good

 Best fiction Movie

 The Matrix

 The best movie of 1999
