 Pretentious and overblown

 Terrible script + mediocre acting + great special effects = The Matrix.

 Disguised Scientology?

 Overrated

 Garbage

 An Awful, Awful Movie

 It's horrible

 Incredibly overrated

 Unintentionally-hilarious trash. Is this where sci-fi is headed?

 One of the worst of the year

 Decent story, but it lacked so much quality.

 Only in Hollywood

 the Matrix, the biggest rip-off of '99

 Plot? We don't need no stinking plot!

 Much glitz, little content. [spoilers]

 How Can Anyone Watch The Matrix More Than One Time?

 Someone's strange dream.

 DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

 good effects, good idea...bad execution

 average stuff. People jumping onto a "cool" bandwagon

 Free your mind....and turn off this junk.

 Special effects for the sake of special effects in a story with no ending

 A special effects outing

 About as deep as the Teletubbies

 Absolutely overrated. And please, don't call it a sci-fi film!
