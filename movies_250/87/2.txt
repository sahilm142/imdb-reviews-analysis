This movie isn't terrible or anything but for it to be considered one of the best animated films ever is really beyond me - of course that's obviously just my opinion. Not sure why I feel that way, it just didn't grab me.I know other people who love the movie who have opinions regarding other movies that I trust and agree with so I fully am aware that I could be "wrong" about this movie but I can't help but feel the way that I do.It really doesn't hold up well in my opinion either, I know the technical aspects of this movie helped make Pixar but things advanced so quickly that looking back at this now makes me say "wow the graphics are bad here."


                
Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the "warmth" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies.....
