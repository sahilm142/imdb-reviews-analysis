 Chaplin understands how close slapstick is to pathos in this classic tearjerking comedy; and remember: kids love this movie

 Charlie Finds a Son

 There are no words to phraise this movie enough

 rarely has there ever been such a deft mix of wonderful absurdity and (dark) sentiment as here

 The Kid was Charles Chaplin's first self-produced and directed feature film.

 "A picture with a smile <U+0096> and perhaps, a tear."

 A timeless classic

 A Sheer Masterpiece of Motion Pictures

 A picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear.
