 Dismal, Violent and Sad

 Logan: Not the most fitting send off

 In My Opinion Probably My Most Favorite Marvel Film.

 I wanted it to be the best one so far, but it isn't...And this is a X-Men fan review !

 The Wolverine film we've been waiting for, just don't take the kids

 More of the same while trying to do an Eastwood flick

 The claws (really) come out

 Not bad for a superhero film

 Hugh Jackman's finest hour

 Let the new game begin!

 A film of two halves

 Certainly the best X-Men film out there

 Tuning into the year 2050...

 Not the Wolverine movie I wanted to watch

 Enter: The personal comic book film

 Okay. Just over-hyped.

 Doesn't live up to the hype.

 A satisfying end for the Hugh Jackman Wolverine

 Grim entry into the Wolverine saga: a big improvement over its two antecedents

 Surprisingly good

 One of those movies that I feel will age better with time.

 The Best stand-alone Wolverine Entry

 Good disappointment FULL SPOILERS

 I was expecting more.

 Lots of gore and violence but a good story to wrap up Wolverine.
