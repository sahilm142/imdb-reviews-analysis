 I love long, dark, well-acted and intelligent films but not this one

 Formulaic, contrived, predictable

 No magic, just cheating

 Misdirection is one thing; this is another

 I wanted to love this film...

 A film that cheats the viewer - and I hated it for that

 What a surprise ending!! I was SO CERTAIN that it wouldn't be stupid!

 Crap Covered Pretzel with Sweet Glaze

 Unsatisfying, overrated

 Derailed by its own Prestige

 Disappointment

 Every great magic trick consists of three acts

 A bit of betrayal at the end

 Poor sound quality

 Overwrought. Falls to its own potential

 It takes 15 Min's to figure it out

 a huge let-down

 Darn...I really wanted to like this movie.

 Let's make magicians hate each other

 Prestigious.....Not!

 Disappointing

 A shallow cinematic confidence trick

 Dueling magicians. Secret obsessions.

 A lot of tricks revealed, but not much of story

 poor cinema
