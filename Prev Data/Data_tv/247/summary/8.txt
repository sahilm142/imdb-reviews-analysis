 Naruto

 Could have been excellent

 A great show with a dynamic line story

 Obviously superior to the first series, but not the best

 Amazing anime

 Awesome plot effectively woven the storyline. No regret after watching it

 good and bad

 Alright...

 One of the best animated series of my life

 The end is near............. or not? Who cares, it is over

 Pretty good show- has a special place in my "heart"

 Solid storyline lined with inconsistent fillers.

 The only anime I ever genuinely loved

 Good movie
