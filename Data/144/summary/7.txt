 Ossessione

 No one stays at the top forever.

 Entertaining, but it lacks bite and emotion

 A distinct Scorcese tasteful movie

 Tons of Atmosphere, Tons of Clichés

 CASINO is long on local color and short on narrative drive. CASINO is also just plain long, clocking in at an excessive 182 minutes.

 I liked it a lot.

 Moments of greatness but overall a flawed gangster epic that is still great to watch though.

 Great acting, but tedious to sit through.

 Low Life in the High Life

 Overlooked Scorsese Crime Drama

 Leaving Old Las Vegas Behind and Not Looking Back

 A movie team to die for.

 A Tale Of Money, Power, Greed, Deception & Murder

 Somewhat Derivative But Has Plenty of That Scorsese Magic

 Don't make me be a bad guy....

 Wise Guys², except not as good.

 "He'll keep coming back until one of you is dead"

 Casino

 No one stays at the top forever

 After movies - Casino

 Although it shouldn't take 2 hours and 51 minutes to tell a good story, Scorsese manages to draw us in.

 Goodfellas in Las Vegas

 shut up, Bobby
