 Maximum education about the WWII

 Interesting Documentary WW2

 Great WW2 films I haven't seen before

 It has its good and bad points.

 Overly condensed; France misrepresented

 A realistic view of World War II

 Good documentary but biased and very French-centric

 Excellent documentary more axed on the Europe operations theater.

 Stunted by narration in USA

 The best WWII documentary I have ever seen
