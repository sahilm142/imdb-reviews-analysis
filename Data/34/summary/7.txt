 Not all that it's cracked up to be...disappointing.

 Highly compelling, but not entirely convincing

 A Confused Film

 Outstanding film with a sensational performance by Edward Norton as fanatic Nazi

 How to ruin a good movie

 An uneasy, sometimes uncomfortable film that pulls no punches and is powerful because of it.

 American (Heavy) History X

 oddly dissatisfying

 Just control the guns already!

 Smart Lead Character ...

 Gives a Great Message !

 Passionate, flawed film

 American History X

 Dramatic But Disappointing

 Nasty, Unsettling, Possibly a Classic...

 Great film

 Decent

 Abrupt ending somewhat ruins it for me

 Very Enlightening

 *** out of ****

 Solid sociological study of racism

 Slick and didactical

 Fantastic Movie

 entertaining and well acted but some parts didn't make sense.

 Disappointing...
