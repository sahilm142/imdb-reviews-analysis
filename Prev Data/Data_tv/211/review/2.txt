The writing was terrible, and so was the quality of the animation work. At times the physical movements of the characters is discontinuous and unnatural, not to mention the hastily drawn characters and the low frame rate. Perhaps the writing does reflect that of the original comic, but c'mon, guys, that was Stan Lee. He may have created some great characters and plot lines (and even that is disputed at times), but as far as dialogue, he's always been a hack.Don't get me wrong, I love the X-Men, having read them when I was a kid in the 70s, watched the movies, as well as X-Men Evolution, all of which are good, but the 90s animated series was lousy.
