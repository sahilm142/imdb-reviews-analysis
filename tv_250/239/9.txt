Wow: This was by far the biggest surprise for me in 2016. And apparently, I was somewhat late to the party, as the show already began to air in 2015. I'm an avid sci-fi fan, but I hadn't heard or read anything about 'The Expanse', and yet it's one of the most ambitious sci-fi (or generally high profile/concept TV) shows I've come across in recent years. First, I believe a little (spoiler-free) information might be helpful prior to watching the show, because the viewer is thrown right into an incredibly detailed world where much is shown rather than explained (which is certainly an elegant choice in terms of storytelling and world-building, but there's so much going on and every shot is packed with so much visual information that it can be a little confusing during the first 2 or 3 episodes). So what you need to know is this: A couple of hundred years into the future, humanity is spread out throughout the solar system and divided into 3 opposing forces who are on the brink of an all out war for political power and resources (mainly water - which is harvested in the form of asteroid ice). The 3 fractions consist of the two superpowers Earth (governed by the U.N.) and Mars; the third party are the "belters", which is basically everyone unfortunate enough to be living on poor dwarf planets like Ceres or other large rocks in the asteroid belt (hence the name "belters").Those belters are the future equivalent of the 3rd World population, as they represent the poor, exploited and underdeveloped colonies in the solar system. Many belters feel represented by the "Outer Planets Alliance" (short: O.P.A.) which is a radical group demanding more autonomy and fairer distribution of resources for the inhabitants of the asteroid belt, but is viewed as a terrorist group by Earth and Mars. Belters are badly affected by the harsh conditions in low (or even zero) gravity (which is often referred to as "low-G" or "zero-G"), as well as low oxygen levels and the strict rationing of water; their bodies develop less muscles and their bone structure has less density compared to that of humans born and raised on Earth or Mars. The belters' life expectancy is roughly half of that of humans living on Earth.So that's the backdrop to the story told in 'The Expanse', and it all may seem a little complicated at the start, because the plot unfolds through several separate story lines. The key parts of the story are told through the eyes of three different protagonists: a high ranking U.N. official on Earth named Avasarala (played by Shohreh Aghdashloo); a cynical belter police detective named Miller (Thomas Jane) whose story starts on Ceres; and a young executive officer named Holden (Steven Strait) working on an ice freighter in space. Although those three don't know it (yet), their stories are connected - and that's all I'm gonna say about the plot, because this show deserves to be watched unspoiled.Featuring visual and narrative elements that reminded me of almost every sci-fi film I ever loved - 'Alien', 'Outland', 'Serenity', 'Blade Runner' and many more - this is an R-rated space opera no sci-fi fan should miss. And although it probably can't compete with 175 million costing blockbusters like the new 'Star Trek' movies in terms of visual effects, 'The Expanse' looks fantastic. Given the insane amount of effects work involved, it must have been a very expensive affair for SyFy (who ordered the series from production companies Alcon Television and The Sean Daniel Company), and although I doubt they were able to afford the kind of budget HBO usually spends on shows like 'Game of Thrones' or 'Westworld', in terms of scope and complexity, this new SyFy show easily matches HBO's flagships (it appears Syfy is trying to get rid of its reputation as "shlock-channel").The storytelling is meticulous and perfectly paced; the world-building richly detailed and always credible, and the patient viewer who doesn't demand everything be explained within the first episodes is rewarded with a thrilling, mysterious tale of adventure and discovery. The cast is terrific (especially Thomas Jane who seems to fit his character like a glove) and the writing manages the astounding feat to elegantly lead us through a very complex world and complicated story without ever feeling forced or weighed down by expository dialogue. Showrunners/writers Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby (known for their Oscar nominated work on the screenplay for 'Children of Men') really have done a fine job bringing the series of novels by James S. A. Corey (aka Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck) to life. Highly recommended to every sci- fi fan: 9 stars out of 10.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/


                
OMG I love this show. I've seen up through S02E03 on Amazon Prime.I only gave it a 9 because I don't like to give anything a 10.Others have gone into good detail of what is good about this show so I'll just add some bullet points that I didn't see covered (although with 250+ reviews I probably just missed 'em)In no particular order other than stream-of-consciousness:* Detailed, realistic science fiction
* Space behaves like, well, space
* Gravity. They did a stellar job with gravity. It isn't perfect. But they emphasize realistic ways to simulate gravity (ships under continuous acceleration, spinning, ring-shaped space stations). And they shut gravity off when appropriate.
* Space ship battles are incredibly thoughtfully designed, with an eye for small details. They pump the air out of the ship before a battle, for goodness' sake. I can't think of *any* other scifi space show that goes into these details
* Consistency. Characters act consistently. Environments act consistently.
* Details. So many details! Mag boots. Ship maneuvers. technology such as computer/handheld devices. All so believable.
* Mormons! There are mormons, because, of course there are. And they aren't even the bad guys! (I only state it this way because too often, mysterious religious groups are used as hollywood shorthand for "bad guys"). The presence of Mormons just enriches the worldbuilding.
* I love the fact that Eros station just looks like a giant potato with a porthole on its butt. It isn't polished. It isn't flashy. It's grimy and utilitarian.
* I love that every move made by a spaceship has corresponding thrusters pushing it in that direction. The space ships do not fly like fighter jets, like they do in other typical sci fi shows. They fly like rocks.
* I love the fact that space craft tracking screens look like legitimate space object tracking screens, with curved, mathematically drawn projected trajectories.I can't gush enough about the "hard" sci-fi elements. I haven't even gushed about the production yet:* Story is detailed, in-depth, and engaging. It's basically a political/war drama, but it is very well written.
* Acting is great. Seriously. Even the throwaway characters are great.
* Anyone can die at any time. Very Game-of-Thrones-y in this regard, in a good way. Builds tension very realistically.
* Costumes, sets, graphics, cinematography are all excellentStar Trek. I used to like Star Trek. Have you seen Star Trek Beyond (2016) though? That was terrible. Everything that is done wrong in Star Trek Beyond is done correctly in The Expanse. In fact, I'm not sure I can watch any Star Trek show or movie again after The Expanse.Ultimately The Expanse feels like a combination of Battlestar Galactica (2005 one) and Firefly, more than any other series I can think of.


                
Others here have said it better than I can, but I can't help but chime in... No modern science fiction TV series has come close to the quality of The Expanse, in my opinion.What does it have?* Movie level special effects
* A plot arc that begins on a very reasonably sound scientific basis (*spoiler*) before it starts slowly introducing aspects of fiction/fantasy
* Kick ass characters who are scientists, engineers, pilots, marines, etc
* Extremely strong and diverse female characters (Avasarala is hot!)
* Lots of attention to detail, especially on the science (although it can be subtle sometimes if you aren't watching closely)
* Occasionally haunting horror aspects
* Excellent acting (although it takes some episodes to start to catch on with some characters)
* Builds up a world history explaining (*spoiler*) how humanity expands into interstellar colonizationWhat more can you ask for?
Syfy's new offering presents camera work, atmosphere, and backgrounds reminiscent from greats like Outland and Alien, among other pillars of the genre. Backed by faces familiar and unknown, the cast does an effective job keeping viewers in the moment as the story progresses.Distinct from shows like The Last Boat, Helix, or Defiance, the story, acting, and dilemmas posed work well with a camera that feels oddly familiar as the first episode lays out the road ahead.Without going into detail, the plot is far from unique. But it is as reasonable a hook as any to bring us into the universe of author James Corey. Conflict between Earth and Mars anchor the show and we are left desiring more information at the show's conclusion.While it is not the next "Battlestar Galactica," it promises to be more. While Galactica wrapped itself in mythology and religion, The Expanse promises a universe troubled by politics, economics, the brokenness of man, all with the familiar look and feel of cinematic greats that came before.If the series can maintain the look, feel, and quality found in those previous movies, The Expanse stands to deliver something new that feels like something old... or at least the best parts of something old.I highly recommend you take a look for yourself; you will not be disappointed.


                
Damn. If the Syfy (I hate that abbreviation) Channel would show more stuff like this and less from The Asylum, I'd watch it more. This is simply great SF. The physics of space travel are as realistic as can be. The characters, from Miller the beat up Belter Cop, to Amos the Earther, to Holden the righteous captain by default and the places, Ceres, Tycho, Earth and Mars are all well defined and believable. The sfx is brilliant and the ship designs look like they've evolved from what we use today. The situations, different governments vying for power, resources and land, are all excellently done. A really great adaptation of a really great book series. This should be watched by anyone who even claims to be a sf fan.


                
I was amazed to see recently that SyFy had cancelled it (no fourth season), I really don't get why cancelling a show of this quality would even be a thing. I assume it comes with a big price tag, but it is worth every penny. There are some terrible science fiction shows out there right now, but The Expanse is not one of them. Anyway apparently Amazon is picking this up due to Jeff Bezos, who as I understand it is a huge fan too, consequently I am now a huge Jeff Bezos fan too.


                
Great writing, interesting story, relatable characters, surprising yet sensible plot twists, few contrived plot devices and overly-convenient happenstances, great actors, well paced, obviously talented and dedicated writers, decent FX, well developed and internally consistent "universe", multi-dimensional characters, good chemistry, well produced series.


                
I have been watching The Expanse since season one and have love it. Finally there was science fiction series that felt like it wasn't created on a shoe-string budget. The special effects seemed first rate, but more than that, the writing was top notch. Each seasoned got better and better as the characters were developed and the story-line became more mature.That being, season 3 left me saying WOW!!!! From the first episode to the last I was super hooked. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. A must see.


                
First off, I went into this show not expecting much because it was on the Syfy channel. I have enjoyed titles by them before, such as Dark Matter, Eureka and Defiance. But most Syfy shows have low budgets and a small fan base. This show blew me and everyone else away. Take everything you think about Syfy and throw it out the window. This show seems like a high budget prime-time TV show. I have only watched the first episode so far so I can't speak for the rest of the show. But judging by the first episode, this show is going to be sick. I also recommend Dark Matter. It is on netflix now and I cannot wait for the second season to release. This show really is like game of thrones in space.


                
First of all, just ignore all the low scoring, it deserves much more than 8.3 score, easily above 9. 
It has full of new cast, they play so well. characters are really good. 
it reminds me BSG series.
But I have to admit, this is more smarter in terms of science and fiction and connects you to real world, maybe the future of the world. 
I found almost everything I was looking for:
science, thriller, drama, politics, relations, love etc. It doesn't have those non-sense sex scenes. 
This is hardcore series, better than most these sci-fi movies..


                
Okay, so I've created an account just to review this, because I think this series doesn't get much credit. The show is very well done, they've spent a lot of time world-building (or shall we say solar system building?). This coupled with the prospect of humanity colonizing the solar system in the next 2 hundred years, good acting, good effects and most importantly a mysterious plot which unfolds incrementally throughout the episodes in my humble opinion makes for an extraordinary series. Definitely worth a watch.
Ambitious, authentic, creative, interesting. Great acting, good stories, amazing SFX, authentic details and great story-telling. Season 1 was OK but it didnt quite deliver for me, it felt a little bit cheap with a not-so-great story. Am currently near the end of season 2 and it is so much more complex and detailed. the stories are involving and go into great details like what it would be like for people from Mars getting used to walking around on earth. Great spaceship and planet FX. Season 2 is much better. Im a fan of BSG (the new seasons) and this is better than that - far fewer cheese/cringey moments, and it doesnt get bogged down on a few points (like religion, democratic processes etc. Recommended especially as one of he lead actresses in Season 2 is from NZ's very own Shortland Street! ha ha


                
The Expanse is based on the series of novels by author James S.A. Corey (the pen name of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck), with the first season following the first book, Leviathan Wakes. In it, Detective Miller is looking for a missing girl, Julie Mao, a missing persons case being a very rare occurrence in the Asteroid Belt. Elsewhere in space, Jim Holden, part of the crew of the Canterbury, hears a distress signal calling out near a rogue asteroid, and has a few of the crew- including himself- to investigate, all the while tensions between Earth, Mars and the Belt are headed to a heated stand-off, with terrorist and activist threats continually growing.The Expanse starts off by throwing the audience into a new futuristic galaxy in the 24th Century, and then slowly showing us the mechanics of how humanity now works, spread out across the system. With this show being on Syfy, I had hopes it would be a good show, also having read the books beforehand, but I didn't expect to be blown away by that premiere (which is available digitally on YouTube). The acting is great, both from the leads and the supporting cast (though Thomas Jane is stand-out as the hard-boiled detective), the direction is superb, showing us a dark and gritty view of the future, hidden behind the facade of lights and clockwork. The writing is fantastic as well, honestly bearing many similarities to Game of Thrones in how the show juggles politics, violence, and sex. Though, what was just stunning and gorgeous, was the production and visuals. If the Syfy logo didn't appear on the episode, you would never have guessed it were Syfy. The visuals are breath-taking, with the scenes involving the Canterbury looking just incredible, and the production values are wonderful, as there is still an abundance of practical effects. Even the music is haunting and beautiful from composer Clinton Shorter, which sounds a bit like District 9 meets Battlestar Galactica.The Expanse is a huge and bold effort from Syfy that, so far, is paying off. The structure of the show is much like that of Game of Thrones, switching between characters and following different plot points as they unfold, all the while revealing more and more about the characters. If you love science fiction, get on board. If not, give it a shot, especially if you're a fan of GoT, because George R.R. Martin himself praises both the show and the novels, who even compared it favorably to his own work, even saying, "It's been too long since we've had a really kickass space opera."


                
My first thought when I watched the first episode was: "My God-- Someone took the elevator to the SY-FY Executive Suites where all the Suits were toasting each other over yet another season of Paranormal Ghost-Hunters, unlimbered a M16 and let it rip...because they must all be dead."They decided to run with one of the current hard Sci-Fi future-tech writers: Correy. And they're doing it competently.The Expanse Universe is fully structured with layered interplanetary politics and personal stories. The FX is done with attention to detail as pertains to realistic dangers and the Physics of Life in Space. Everything looks like the future...a realistic future with a yet 'lived in' quality to it. But not outlandish or 'Star-Trekkish'. I would admonish people who've actually read Correy's novels...remember that this is BASED on his story. We've yet to see what 'tweaks' will be made for this adaptation...but overall, I remember thinking that when BattleStar Galactica ended that I would never see anything anyone, much less Sy-Fy, attempt intelligent, adult-level hard & gritty TV Sci-Fi ever again.I happy to say my prediction was wrong.PS-- Whoever is responsible for the Producer Executive massacre: I sincerely hope you got the Executives responsible for Helix while you were at it!


                
The show keeps getting bigger and better with every episode (and it already started out as one of the most promising sci-fi shows), right now I am blown away by the complexity of the story and cannot wait for season 4. Wow.


                
I started this show randomly once in early 2017. I got half way through the first season and fell out of interest for a little bit. I picked it back up a friend told me the books were great and it has been a awesome experience ever since. I was one episode shy of where it picked up and beat myself up for not giving it a chance. The beginning of the show does so much to try and lay a great foundation (which they are successful at when looking back now) so the rest of the series can go on the wild adventure it does. It's Sci-Fi and mystery with awesome suspense. Can't wait to see Amazon continue this amazing story.


                
I don't remember how I stumbled across The Expanse. Word of mouth most likely.I watched the first episode, and I'll be honest, there was A LOT going on. It was a lot to take in. But I persisted.Similar situation for episode two.By episode three, things started to come together. I started to care about the characters, and the story. It started making sense.And after that, I was hooked.If you enjoy hard sci-fi. It you enjoy character drama. If you enjoy political drama. If you enjoy an *ahem* expansive story, with great acting, and fantastic production quality, I'd bet good money you will enjoy The Expanse. Part of the way through season 3, and I am looking forward to the new episodes every day!


                
' The Expanse ' is what Sci-fi fans have yearned for years. The storyline and script are great in that it doesn't over-reach and commits to rational possibilities that could confront humanity in the next century as humanity expands into the galaxy.Major kudos to the producers and staff who have created the greatest sci-fi series of all-time.


                
This is the best sci-fi TV show I have seen after the Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, and Firefly. It's plot, character are well cooked and played. Hope this will be continued for more seasons. The acting is well done. The visual is top notch. The show packs up suspense and thriller.


                
If it continues to improve as it has Season 4 is likely to elevate this to my first 10 review score.
As many have said, it is a bit slow to start with (the best series always are - GOT etc) and it was confusing at first, but I couldn't wait to watch it again to put the pieces together.
I'm a self confessed Treki but this probably took space SiFi to the next level with it's excellent intertwined narratives and great suspense levels. 
So if you are like minded space SiFi geek like me the Expanse is a must see show!!


                
The show really scratched the itch that Firefly left in me.


                
Based on the books under the same name and sticking very closely to the plot this is a great example of scifi. The plot, as per the books, moves between several stories (2 main ones) that converge at various points. If it seems like two separate stories at first, stick with it as they do come together.Plot in brief = there are two main power blocks in a fully colonised solar system - Earth and Mars. The rest of the system wants to be the third main player. The hero's of the piece are a bunch of space haulers thrust by circumstance into such a role. The characters themselves are nothing new for the genre with a huge exception to Chrisjen Avasarala played superbly by Shohreh Aghdashloo. There can't be too many Middle Eastern actresses in mainstream series that get such a juicy character and then play them so perfectly.Effects are well above average and show a fair portion of the budget was spent wisely. As I write this the third season will be along in a few weeks. I'm looking forward to it.
The acting, storyline, special effects, suspense, mystery, everything, it is all the best I've seen in a space opera in a while. I also like the realism not seen in many space operas. Like the effects of growing up in low gravity. The politics between the different entities in the solar system is also interesting.I'm really glad that there is another good scifi series out there now. The genre has been sorely lacking good content lately. It was decent from the beginning but after four episodes now it really picked up pace. Can't wait to see where this goes.The series needs to get out of the obscurity it is in now. It deserves far more popularity.


                
If you enjoy sci fi but need it to intrigue as well as challenge the limits of your imagination, then The Expanse is just what you've been waiting for. The show comes across as very expensive because everything and I mean everything appears so real. The Expanse demonstrates just how far sci fi has come since say Star Trek Generations. Additionally, as well as significantly is the fact that there is a darkness to the story line designed to capture the audience's interest, and it works very, very well. This show will not disappoint any true sci fi disciple provided the writer can maintain what they created for the pilot show. Currently on the pilot is available so I really hope that the writers have it in them to do what needs to be done, because this show could become a real award winner.


                
Bit of a slow burner to start with, but once you get through the first few episodes, if you enjoy good, enjoyable (even if cliched at times), believable(ish) sci-fi, then check this series out. Part Firefly, part 2001, a wee bit Star Wars, but all good. Yes, a couple of dodgy actors, but their characters still engage you. Give it a try, I doubt you'd be disappointed.
