 Brilliant, stunning and disturbingly entertaining

 A film described as the sociological masterpiece of the decade and, often as dangerously vicious<U+0085>

 The Eye and the Genital

 "Viddy well, little brother. Viddy well."

 One-Of-A-Kind

 A black comedy so black some will not see the comedy....

 Hilarious Black Comedy

 Memorably off the wall

 A stylish interpretation of Burgess's dystopian novel -OR- misogynist art porn masquerading as relevant social commentary? (possible spoilers)

 A Vicious Socio-Political Satire That's Witty & Disturbing In Equal Doses!

 "What's it going to be, eh?"

 Watch it !!!

 This was my favourite film as a teen

 Fantastic, and totally unique.

 Still startling, one of Kubrick's best

 Glorifying violence?! No way!

 Has one of the best scenes of all time

 Not for the kids

 Kubrick masterpiece

 A True Masterpiece of a Film

 Codpiece: Check! Bowler hat: Check! Eyeliner: Check! I'm ready<U+0085>

 Brilliant in strange way!

 a century ahead of its time,boundless,timeless movie.............

 An almost hypnotic movie that has more class than most can handle.

 Might as well be Kubrick's finest
