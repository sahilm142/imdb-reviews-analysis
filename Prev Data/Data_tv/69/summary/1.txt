 Extremely formulaic fantasy medical detective show

 House isn't what it once was.

 Horrible show

 Greg isn't perfect, the series isn't either.

 A.k.a. Wacko's Haven

 so glad this elephant's ass of a show is over

 House Needs to Die

 Good show but going through bad patch.

 Whoa, deja vu?

 Unadulterated rubbish

 Garbage!

 Just cant get over the BAD BAD acting from Hugh Laurie.

 No

 Enjoyable show got wrecked by House suicide attempt

 horrible

 Exceptional - makes scrubs look silly

 Is house believable?
