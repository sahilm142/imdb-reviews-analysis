Ni deez...  I was pretty bored the whole movie.  A bunch of people have told me how funny it was but thinking back, they were all white guys with no rhythm.  The movie was silly, but not funny.  It was kind've painful to watch - I couldn't wait for it to end.  Then again, maybe my hopes were just too high going into the movie.
