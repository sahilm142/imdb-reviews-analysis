 A Perfectly Crafted Mystery - (very ambiguous spoiler)

 BEST Thriller movie in the world.

 The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...

 Composition

 The Usual Suspects Certainly Defies Pigeon Holing or Labeling!

 must see

 Perfectly Simple / Simply perfect

 I have no words for how good this movie is

 Noir at its best
