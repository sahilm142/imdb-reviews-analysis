 Different strokes for different folks

 This show is in a nosedive

 A rare feat in comedy shows

 It's Wicked, It's Wild and It's Always Sunny

 If you can overlook some repetition, there's some good jokes to be found in this series

 Extremely overrated.

 i think people miss the moral

 decent series

 A hilarious show for a niche audience.
