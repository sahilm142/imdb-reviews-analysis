Gonna get a lot of hate for this but this was just NOT for me even though I had set no expectations from it. The events and storylines changes rapidly with very little expectations. People seem to promise not meet again but they are dating again and back to not meeting again in the same episode.
A series that could be wrapped up in 5 episodes is dragged to 16. IT HAD ITS MOMENTS HERE AND THERE but in between those moments, the characters and stories between them was just going back and forth between same tried and tested events. LOT of inconsistencies with many continuity errors.
I think I need to watch few more k-dramas to develop a taste for them. Until then, its 4/10 from me.
