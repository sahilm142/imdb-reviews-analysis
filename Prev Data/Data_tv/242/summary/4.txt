 One of the most boring, tedious television series in existence

 This is "Fringe"

 Noblesse Oblige cannot save Malady of the Mysterious Mediocrity

 everything and nothing

 A show too afraid of its own mythology

 Rigid format fails - poor sci-fi at best.

 The son and the scientist save the show
