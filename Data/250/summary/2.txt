 Massively overrated. What am I missing?

 Greatly disappointed!

 We left the theater. It was that bad. (Spoilers)

 My ten year old voted to leave pretty fast

 Disappointed

 Weak plot and lots of nonsense battles

 So much money, so little meat...

 Awesome special effects, weak and forgettable story

 hugely OVERRATED

 And what was all the fuss about.

 I am sorry to say this is one of the worst movies I've seen

 Major Disappointment

 Clichéd, pointless, boring.

 Dross

 B o r i n g

 CGI on Steroids

 Couldn't Care Less about this movie
