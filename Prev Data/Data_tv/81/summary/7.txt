 Such a shame

 Moving too slowly.....

 Larry Sanders ... on Steroids

 Solid 7, but I doubt people would watch this if it weren't a spin off

 I like season 1-3 more than Breaking Bad

 When will something happen?

 Slow, contains good dialogues

 Slow burn, with rising steam.

 Interesting; but vastly overrated

 Very interesting and high hopes for future seasons

 A good show but in a very slow way.

 Great for people with heart conditions.

 Season 4 started good

 Not Breaking Bad

 Better Call Saul is not as good as you imagine.

 Good things come to those who wait

 Fun!

 A show that soon needs to establish what it is

 Flawed

 Getting SO much better!

 It's ok kinda dark though

 Better Get Better...

 Overrated Series When Compared to Breaking Bad

 It's too early on to judge.

 Good.. but unsatisfying
