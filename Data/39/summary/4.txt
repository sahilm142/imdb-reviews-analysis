 Morally ambiguous

 Nothing New, Nothing Different...Nothing At All...

 A decent, but unspectacular Holocaust movie

 To show how it really was like doesn't mean to make a good movie.

 Over-rated story of survival

 See Schindler's List and skip this one.

 a film that was uneven

 This movie was an insult

 So over-rated...

 I didn't like this movie and I blame the director!

 So this film was made as it had got to be made ! ! !
