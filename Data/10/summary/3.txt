 strange film

 An overrated film by an overrated director based on an overrated book by an awful writer

 Style over substance.

 Violent, lame, Bloody, lame

 Lame

 "Full of sound and fury...

 Don't Spit in the Soup, Watch UFC!

 It's not a changeover, it's a deus ex machina that's spelled R-E-F-U-N-D

 Borrrrriiinnnggg

 A waste of time

 Not My cup Of Tea May have spoilers*** SORRY

 Pretentious

 139 minutes of my life wasted.

 Keep still while I punch you

 Hyped classic of emptiness

 avoid at all possibility

 Great build-up, awful conclusion

 Gratuitous violence in search of a message

 Graphically stylish, aestheticizes violent anti-social behavior

 Worse than the credits of Alien 3

 Most Overrated Movie Ever

 Overrated rubbish

 Flawed

 technically interesting, but kinda juvenile

 A dissenting opinion....
