 From one of the best shows..

 Political Correctness with a Thin Veneer of Sci-Fi Drama

 Horrible and even worse because expectations were so high

 waste of time

 Don't believe the 10/10's

 Bad series

 Please stop the pain !

 Words cannot describe my disappointment

 Could have been so much better

 This is ultra-leftist-slanted garbage masquerading as sci-fi.

 Very Disappointed

 After 11 s 04 e, I've decided to abandon X-files...

 What the hell happened to X-Files?

 Revived seasons are stilted and unskilled

 Left Coast Lunacy

 Old tired, past it's end date.

 Defense department covers up UFOs so they can ask for smaller budget?

 Should have stayed dead
