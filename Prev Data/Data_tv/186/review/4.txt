Hammy acting and a flimsy script ruin what should have been an interesting look at how we perceive reality and our ability to control or change our lives, society etc. Nice try, but done better before and after this show. Worth a watch, especially if you are interested in the 'baby boomer' genre. A strange cross between Get Smart, James Bond, In Like Flint and Dark Star. Probably a template for the Truman Show, which has a very similar premise. Rover, the murderous bubble, is my favorite character and a main character at that. If you are looking for the meaning of life, the universe and everything- look elsewhere. All episodes are available on you tube.
