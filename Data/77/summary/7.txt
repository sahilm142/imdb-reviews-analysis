 Very Overrated

 You Don't Believe In Tipping ?

 A Bleak and Disturbing Film from a Treasured Director.

 Oh, yeah, this is a Q.T. film

 Dogfight

 A crime classic? Very doubtful.

 It's not the pieces, it's the drive

 " War is an Argument which got out of hand "

 You wanna squirm?

 I love this film...but here's why it's not a ten.

 Interesting Premise, Solid Outing

 Simple plot done well

 Tarantino Tarantino-ing

 Tarantino Makes His Mark

 Almost Like Pulp Fiction

 A True Heist Fillm Without Seeing the Heist

 Pretty thrilling

 A different perspective to a crime movie but boring!

 I'am $%$#@ dying here!!!!

 Despite It's Slick Style And Unique Take, It Leaves You Underwhelmed

 The alienation in Reservoir Dogs

 Tarantino Takes Off

 If you were put off by the legendary violence, don't be - there isn't much at all

 Moral of the story - Be professional. Tarantino's first deals with the jovial before and the bloody aftermath of a job gone awry.

 Tarrantino is a legend!
