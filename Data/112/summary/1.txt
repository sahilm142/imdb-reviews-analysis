 cynical cash-in of the worst variety

 Carry on murdering

 Cheesy, tedious retread of "Raiders of the Lost Ark"

 No wonder the film series ended after this atrocity.

 I thought I loved Indiana Jones movies

 One of the worst movies I've ever seen

 "DAD!"..."DAD!" "DAD!" "DAD!!!" ...OMG Just shut up, dude!
