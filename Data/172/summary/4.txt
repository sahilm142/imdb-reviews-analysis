 Scorsese throws a curve ball; audience strikes out

 Did I miss something?

 Someone is missing! Yeah. Scorsese.

 To the Lighthouse

 Tricky Ending, Unrealistic Story And Ending

 Valentine's Day Can't Be Worse Than This

 A definite letdown

 The story is dreary and totally depressing

 Disappointing

 Really? !***!SPOILERS!***!

 The original was more exciting

 The trailer is a 10, the movie is a 4.

 Predictable and not that good

 All portent and no meaningful delivery

 Scorsese Horror Flick Borders Mediocrity

 Disappointing ending

 Unconvincing

 A thinly plotted ensemble with dreary, disconnected flashbacks

 wait for the DVD on this flick

 Bizarre film with a disturbing plot.

 Marty . . . was this movie really necessary?

 Well, crap on me, there's a murderer in the asylum or something

 A barely enjoyable miss

 Utter Hokum!!!

 Did people on here watch the same movie!?!?!
