 great but doesn't deserve to be compared with masterpieces

 TDK, a solid superhero movie, nothing more

 not as good as all the hype

 Did you people see the same film I saw?

 Highly overrated, but Heath saves it.

 Hype

 So overrated!

 good but overrated

 Is it really one of the top 10?

 Take off the fanboy goggles!

 It is certainly not a 9.7 rated movie. Maybe a 7 or an 8

 Good film

 What marketing can do

 Are you kidding?

 The Joke's On Us

 Good movie but grossly overrated

 Who ever said becoming was better than become?

 Overrated and Two Face has no face

 Not as good as "The Dark Whopper"

 does NOT live up to the hype

 Good but over-hyped

 Not as good as I'd hoped

 Not bad, but not great. This is the Doctor Zhivago of Batman movies.

 Great fun, but woefully overrated

 Don't Believe The Hype!
