 Bad Acting, Worse Script.

 A banal display of gimmickery and staggeringly amateurish acting.

 Predictable and Cliché, enjoyable only for the sheep.

 Unbelievably overrated

 Get Off My Yawn

 This movie was painful to watch

 Ouch!

 I think some, if not many will agree with me

 Don't do yourself a disservice and subject you and your loved ones to this cinematic fiasco

 Crotchety Korean war veteran is racist and remains racist and an asshole and then gets to be a good guy.

 meh

 Horrible

 Literal, simplistic, predictable, manipulative - typical Eastwood

 horrible acting and awful screenplay makes worst Eastwood movie ever...

 Worst Clint Eastwood movie ever.

 Sucks

 Clint Eastwood strikes and misses.

 Terribly embarrassed for my boy Clint

 This Really Needs To Get Off The Top 250 NOW!

 dull, plodding, improbable, vague, inane

 One of the worst movies i've seen lately

 colossal waste of time and money

 Clint Eastwood at his worst

 Stinking pile
