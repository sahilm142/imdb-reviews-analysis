 Judge it the way it should.

 Not up to the first season, but still entertaining if you enjoy this sort of overcharged pulp

 Prequel w/o title character

 Exciting even for someone who hasn't watched the First Series !

 Bombastic prequel to hit show Spartacus: Blood and Sand

 packed with action, history, treachery, bold scenes and more

 Historical Blood-Action Drama. Looking back, the best way forward.

 Just a hollow empty shell

 Batiatus Fun

 If you enjoy close range weapon combat than you'll love spartacus

 Much better than I expected

 Great show!
