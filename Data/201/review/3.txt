Please forgive the 'cute' subject line. Also, I never intend to throw in spoilers, but in evaluating the film with total honesty, it's sometimes necessary to do so. I also don't believe in plot summaries, as you can read hundreds of them elsewhere on this very site. In some ways, this evaluation reads best if you've already seen the movie. One or two more notes: I came into this film, as always, wanting to love it, and hoping to be transported, and at times it did take me for a good ride. Also, I happened to love Mystic River, the last directorial effort by Eastwood (Frankie),I could probably listen to Morgan Freeman ("Scrap") do a voice-over of The Congressional Quarterly, and though I never saw Boys Don't Cry, I am convinced there is an earnestness and an inner beauty to Hilary Swank (Maggie) that impresses me. Okay, on to the evaluation:The good: Swank's performance as Maggie -- she did all she could with the role, although it wasn't the most interesting character, and she was ultimately let down by poorly drawn peripheral characters and a very mediocre script. Freeman is always good, and Eastwood's acting was pretty good. The look of the film was OK, the 3 leads looked their parts, the gym looked authentic, and it gave some insight to the job of the cutman. And, at times (but not often), the voiceovers added to the film. Also, some of the byplay between Frankie and Scrap was good stone-busting, yet it never elevated to great drama or great humor - just okayThe bad: The voiceovers too often told you what to think, or what was coming. They did not enrich the story, a la Shawshank, but often were patronizing, and seemed to be a device to cover for what the "action" could not do. All of the other characters - outside of the big 3 - were poorly drawn, and two-dimensional --all of them! For a movie that gave you pretty good boxing scenes and insight, it made no sense that Maggie didn't win the title on The Blue Bear's obvious disqualification. The backstory between Scrap and Frankie was not very interesting or textured. We never get enough, or really anything, about why Frankie's daughter never reads his letters. (That's not minimalism - that's just sloppiness. And, it's not like the film doesn't hit you over the head at other times.) Also, why does Maggie - the ultimate fighter in life and in the ring - suddenly do a "180" and want to die? There are so many shortcomings here: Why didn't the scenes with the priest really come alive, intellectually or emotionally? I don't mind that the movie switched tones, but aside from a touching moment or two between Maggie and Frankie, it had very little to say, and it didn't really explore the issues with any depth.The ugly: There was absolutely no subtlety to the depiction of Maggie's family (and they couldn't have been a minor force in shaping who she was) --just horrible, lazy, mean-spirited screen writing here. A little bit of the Danger character went a long way --was there any explanation as to why he was still doing his idiot act for months on end at the gym? Again, he was too stupid to be truly sympathetic, and too cartoonish to be anything less than pitiable. Not funny, not even dramatic - just ugly.When I watched this movie, I thought it was about an '8" or a "b". Every time I reflect on it, I get angry at the bad script, the two dimensional characters and the wasted talent, and the inability to really involve us, other than wanting to see Maggie (the ultimate diamond in the rough) make it. So, at best, this movie, on reflection, was a "D" -- I say this with sadness, and the feeling that if I keep thinking about it, its grade will plummet further.
SPOILER ALERT! I enjoyed the cinematography. The gym looked great. Hilary Swank was good and the banter between Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood was highly engaging- but reminiscent of many "buddies" from many different movies. There was little original here.The strange character of Danger was, well, strange. In the end he seemed to exist primarily so A) Eastwood could say grumpy things about him thus appearing to be gruff and lovable at the same time, and B) so Morgan Freeman could have a moment of glory when he punches out Danger's tormentor. I didn't mind these moments in the plot, but we must admit that they are not the stuff of genius. Disney provided countless similar moments in their live action movies of the seventies (See the Herbie series).The boxing was utterly unbelievable for anyone who has actually watched boxing. However it was amusing to see Hilary knock out boxer after boxer much to her coach's- Clint's- exasperation.The final opponent- the evil woman who cheats and knocks Hilary out- would surely have been suspended several times based on the behavior depicted in the film. This might not be obvious to everyone- but boxing is not professional wrestling.Hilary's family is so ridiculously evil that I have to laugh when I remember them. The scenes of Hilary sitting by the hospital window day after day while her family went to Disneyland were painful- but not in the way they were meant to be.The final scenes seem like a vote for euthanasia and I felt a little ripped off. There is a great deal that's implausible in these scenes. Where does Clint find the needle and the drugs? How does he know what to do? Why don't the nurses on duty catch on? Why isn't there an investigation? But even more importantly- there was no need for the secrecy. As far as I understand, Hilary needed to be on a ventilator or she would die. There is no law that says you have go on a ventilator- at least not in the province where I live. She could have requested to be removed from the machine and died peacefully, without Clint's apparent heroics.Overall, very disappointing for a movie that was so hyped by critics. There was nothing outstanding about it. What was fun was far from original. What was bad was so bad that it seriously cripples the whole thing.I can't imagine why intelligent critics loved it in such large numbers. Had this movie been released in February, I believe many people would have cooled toward it by the time Oscar season rolled around. Now I fear it may displace superior movies at the awards show, causing future critics and fans to scratch their heads.


                
While this comment goes against the tide of popular opinion, I believe that "Million Dollar Baby" is tediously self-indulgent and formulaic. From the opening moments of this overly-long, predictable movie, the audience is presented with one clichéd situation after another - in fact towards the end of the film, one can practically see the kitchen sink descending! Many of the characters are nothing more than stereotypes - particularly the boxer's trashy and unscrupulous family.Swank's acting skills cannot be faulted, but one becomes very tired of Eastwood's deeply soulful gazes, as he metamorphoses from an impatient curmudgeon, reluctant to undertake the training of a "girlie" boxer to a deeply caring father-figure. None of the characters is explored in depth. Instead we have hackneyed situations, inducing a strong sense of deja vu. Haven't we encountered these themes and these character types in one form or another before? Morgan Freeman is an extremely capable actor, but hasn't he assumed a similar persona in many other films? "Shawshank Redemption" comes to mind, for a start.I realize that "Million Dollar Baby" will have much popular appeal, since the film demands no challenging cerebral activity from its viewers, but instead shamelessly manipulates their emotions. For my part, I found the movie to be a nauseating concoction of schmaltz, political correctness and predictability.


                
I'll avoid spoilers at the beginning of this review. MDB was well-acted and directed and had me interested in the story up until the "twist," which took the film in a different direction for the final 45 minutes.An important element in a good film is being able to make the viewer care about and sympathize with the protagonists. MDB lost me and I stopped caring about the main characters because of some of the decisions that they made near the end of the film. MDB tries to be a drama, but a number of unrealistic scenes make it play more like a melodramatic comic book. One scene, in particular, involving Morgan Freeman, is laughable in its lack of believability. In the end, the film comes off as being preachy. Out of the blue, it tackles a controversial societal topic and tries to force its point of view upon the audience. In doing so, it betrays the integrity of the film and ruins everything good that had built up to that point. The last half hour was torturous to watch and just dragged on at a needlessly slow pace.***SPOILERS BELOW*** I get the feeling that the intention of MDB was to make a case for euthanasia all along and just use the boxing story as a disguise. I strongly disagree with the message of the film: that it is better to die as a championship boxer than to live a life in a wheelchair. The film is a slap in the face to all those who have achieved great things after paralysis, such as Christopher Reeve. Maggie could have used her celebrity status to go on to do great things and raise money and awareness for her condition, as Reeve did. Instead, she makes a terrible decision. I am truly baffled as to why some people applaud the films ending or are emotionally moved by Maggie's death.On a final note, I am not against euthanasia, per se. I think it depends on the situation. For example, in "One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest," I was deeply moved when the Chief took Jack's life at the end, and I agreed with the decision. This was a case of someone who had a lobotomy and had his personality robbed of him. Maggie, on the other hand, had her personality and intellect still in tact, which is more important than her body.***END SPOILERS***


                
Am I the only one who thinks Million Dollar Baby is a terrible movie? It won best film, best director (Clint Eastwood), best actress (Hilary Swank) and best supporting actor (Morgan Freeman) at the Academy Awards. (And all four Oscars were prominently displayed during the cast interview.) I'd avoid plot spoilers for those who haven't seen it, but the plot is so clichéd, thin and predictable, I can't offer guarantees.The only change to the old poor-boy-makes-good-boxing formula is that it's a poor girl this time.Hilary Swank is pretty good and the boxing scenes are fairly well choreographed, but neither are good enough to rescue the movie from dreary predictability. The direction is marginally competent in places, and I even think I spotted Clint act at one point. Otherwise, his caricature of a bitter old grouch was simplistic and one-dimensional.But neither Swank's efforts, nor Morgan Freeman's characteristic likability, could save the movie from a premise that is such a tired old workhorse that I'm surprised anyone bothered with it. It's a politically-correct Rocky rehash.Apparently, it made everyone who read the script cry, so that justified making it. Well, I cried during The Champ. But that was 30 years ago.This was pure self-indulgence on the part of Clint Eastwood. The grand question that tears at his soul was the cherry on top. "Look how strong and moral and basically good I am!" It was shot in 37 days. That shows. Even the screenwriter said he was surprised that his first draft was shot. He wouldn't have done that, and he would have been right not to. There were a loose ends all over the place, implausible scenarios (you'd think fingerprints in the hospital ward would have been an issue), and a lot of stock scenes that could have done with some disguise.And how about that pukey guy talking to Eastwood, Swank and Freeman on the DVD cast interview afterwards? I'd be embarrassed to be interviewed by such a fawning fool. "I know I shouldn't say 'genius', but *sigh* GENIUS *faint*". It was creepy.Swank made the only worthwhile contribution, both in her effort in the role, and in commenting afterwards that the movie did something for female boxers. It's not all just crude trailer-trash violence, and some of these women deserve a bit of respect - and self-respect.But other than that, it was a load of codswallop. A waste of money. I give it three out of ten, as a consolation prize to Swank. Clint Eastwood - of whom, incidentally, I'm a big fan - gets nada.
With the exception of Hillary Swank's, the characters were 1 dimensional or stolen out of previous movies. I like that Morgan Freeman role; I really do. Perhaps no one plays the quiet, down on his luck, sensitive but tough narrator like Morgan Freeman does. Of course, he should be good at it since years before he played a nearly identical character in Shawshank Redemption. I guess I just didn't want to see Red again with only his name changed. I can't be so generous with Clint. If you put him up for best actor this time then you have to put him up for all the other times he played a good man of few words. Can you really say this was an original character for him? It was Maggie's family, however, that bothered me most. They weren't bad, they were 1 dimensional evil. There was nothing misunderstood or complex about them; they were just plain rotten. And the mother tells Maggie she lost the fight. Am I supposed to be stupid? ESPN broadcasts a title fight in which a boxer does a cheap shot for the ages and we're supposed to believe that never mind jail, she was actually given the win? One long time boxing analyst has commented that he has never seen or heard of an event like that in all his years of following the sport. You can put an extraordinary cheap shot in the movie but don't ask me to believe that girl wasn't at least disqualified. That's just absurd. These pieces aside, the movie splits into 2 sections. The first part is a typical overcome adversity sports movie that was pretty good within that highly populated niche. It could have just ended there but instead it used the absurd cheap shot to transform into an outright depressing story. Here the movie benefited from how likable Swank's character was, but was hurt by the introduction of her unbelievably horrible family. I could only come to the conclusion that Clint was willing to use any tactic to make it more upsetting. When you step back and look at the film, it wasn't telling us much about real life unless Clint's view of the world is that there's no point digging yourself out of a hole because no matter what you do some ridiculous cheap shot will knock you back in. Maggie didn't fail on her own. She did absolutely everything right and just took some freak accident that has no real world place in the activity she was involved with. If that wasn't bad enough, she was stuck with a family so 1-dimensionally nasty as to lack credibility. What's the point? What did I learn from that? If you want to be depressed in a legit way that actually teaches us about the world we live in, watch Terms of Endearment or Ordinary People. Those movies are about the real world and what people have to overcome. They don't have mothers yelling at their daughters for buying them houses. And they don't focus on the non existent problem in this world of too many people somehow breaking their spine by getting hit in the back of the head while walking back to their boxing corner.
This movie won the Academy Award for best picture, and has been hailed in many quarters as profound and moving. Either I am getting more and more out-of-touch with modern Western (maybe American) sensibility, or some kind of hyper-calculated dark force is taking over the dramatic arts (American TV and movies especially). I could barely stay awake as I watched it. The movie starts out oddly flat and moves slowly through one calculated scene after another. In terms of the boxing background and the fight scenes, although maybe it is more accurate than Rocky, it certainly was only technically average. Of course, the cinematography is first-rate, and the three lead actors, Eastwood, Swank and Freeman, all have great screen presence, but the movie smelled of melodrama from beginning to end and it left me feeling strangely cold. I think we need a new phrase to describe the kind of mood this movie evinced. What comes to mind for me is 'cynical corniness.' The same phrase aptly applies to what has metastasized on American television in recent years, i.e., the CSI franchise and the Law and Order franchise. Paul Haggis is the television writer who wrote the screenplay, and he transferred into the film the same sensibility that has taken over much of TV: Protagonists (heroes) are cynical, cold, and sardonic, yet totally loved for all their deficiencies, and characters who are weird or odd are definitely worthless and possibly evil. However, to conceal the cynicism of this dark social matrix, the de rigueur of this sensibility is to press the correct socio-political buttons. If the pathos is false and calculated, it is much harder for an audience to detect it when the drama is cornered with progressively correct structures--i.e., Hilary Swank as the poor, female boxer. So when she is paralyzed in a fight at the cusp of being champion by a ridiculously evil tactic by the 'weird other' (the other boxer), then we are supposed to feel so sad as she is heroically euthanized on her request by America's Tough-Guy-With-A-Heart Hero, Clint Eastwood (with wise black man Morgan Freeman as a muse). It is a foolproof, bathetic structure that hides from the audience the deeper, more general bigotry and facile stereotyping in the film. For example, Swank's character comes from white trash, and the way the movie shows this is done with all the subtlety of a bad cartoon. Her amazing progress as a fighter is extremely corny. She goes from wide-eyed ingenue to a totally dominant fighter in awkward and unrealistic steps. But because we have Clint as the cynical foil, and Morgan Freeman looming around in his typical saint role, many of the contrived scenes somehow served as ballast to keep this turkey afloat. The pathetic, southern, white-boy, wannabee boxer named 'Danger' also fills a void in the film by being just the right category of odd thing that the modern, hip person can hate safely. His vibe is corny and his existence is totally unrealistic in a gritty, underground boxing gym, but, just like Clint's, Morgan's and Hilary's, his character constitutes exactly the right socio-political button. I have to be careful here: I am not trying to give ammunition to right-wingers. I have no problem with progressive ideals, i.e., women being tough as men, and freedom of choice over dogma. The problem I have is when these ideals are simply buttresses to conceal and build a calculated cynicism. This ideological process is manifesting very strongly on American television right now and, I fear, it is spreading to the movies. Can't anyone else see this???
First, the acting by Freeman, Eastwood and Swank was great. They drew me in to this film and I was enjoying the first two-thirds of this film. Then all hell breaks loose when Swank's character falls on the stool, and the last third of the movie becomes so bad.If the screenwriter could have stuck with the great story telling in the first two acts, maybe the third act wouldn't come off as some ridiculous soap opera. Maybe I should have seen it coming after Swank's character talks about her father bringing her dog out to the woods.I would have liked to see the dirty boxer "blue bear" being punished in some way like having her titled taken away, being banned from boxing and being sent to prison, or better yet, have Clint Eastwood get all "Dirty Harry" on her(just kidding on that one).This could have been a great film showing that Swank's character wouldn't give up in achieving her goals and Eastwood's character learning to forgive himself for the past.The Good: - The acting, the first 2 acts of the script, and Swank's character.The Bad: - Last third of the movie, the minute Maggie lands on the stool. Another bad third act film is Collateral.The Ugly: - Maggie's family and Blue Bear.That's just my opinion. If you don't agree and loved the film, then state why you liked it instead of getting upset on here because every one doesn't agree with your opinions. 3 out of 10 (would have been 9 out of 10).
Million Dollar Baby does not solve any questions it presents. I can't believe it's in the top 250.OK, where shall I begin? Well, for a start, it was incredibly predictable. Clint Eastwood plays one of the most clichéd characters ever. He's a tough man with a heart of gold. John Wayne anyone? Also, Hilary Swank was garbage in it. She was so wooden, and I didn't believe for a second she was a remotely good boxer. I hated it how she got all the good scenes instead of Morgan Freeman who was the only good thing about this film.Paul Haggis is perhaps the most overrated writer in recent times. He uses such formulaic dialogue, it makes a Tarantino fan like myself vomit feverishly when I hear a line like "You're all I've got." There are tons of other examples but I can't remember them because I was so bored.Also, it tries to do too much. It tries to deal with the father daughter relationship, Rednecks, euthanasia, how you have to take chances, how you shouldn't gamble etc. Never heard those issues being discussed before have we lades and gents? Especially not in one film. I can imagine Haggis at his typewriter thinking "How can I spread the plague of my crap TV writing to the wider audience? I know, I'll try to make a boxing movie, WITH A DIFFERENCE!! I'll deal with tons of issues to win the critics over." Sadly Paul, I'm not fooled.I admit, the cinematography was good in the car scene where the light moves and you can't see their faces and stuff but this light dark thing didn't work for a lot of the film. There were countless scenes where a character stood with their head in darkness. That's not an overused technique is it? And the ending, oh God the ending was abysmal. For those who haven't seen it, let me just let you know it is predictable the second she gets knocked out by a one dimensional East German evildoer. Ahhhhh! I hate characters like that boxer. They don't exist in the real world and how the hell is she world champion? She would get disqualified for breaking the rules obviously. It's such a cop out from the idiot that is Paul Haggis of making poor innocent Hilary, who has just knocked like 20 people out with one punch (realistic huh?), get knocked out by a cheating communist bitch.If only Pauline Kael was still alive and writing. I am certain she would have shown this film for what it is, sentimental garbage. She is famous for hating unrealistic idealism and that is exactly what this appallingly overrated film is about. R.I.P Pauline, one of the few critics who saw through the sad state of most Hollywood movies.


                
Very good film, but hardly "the masterpiece" described by Roger Ebert. It is basically a very well done Hallmark Hall of Fame TV Movie. It has Clint Eastwood as a lovable curmudgeon with a heart of gold. Hillary Swank, who is terrific, plays a strong-willed survivor with a heart of gold. Morgan Freeman is cast in his usual role of a wise, quiet observer with a heart of gold. All this becomes ultimately too cloying. Perhaps I expected more because so much was written about it. A good movie, but still doesn't surpass "Sideways" as best picture of the year. Hillary Swank should get the Oscar for her acting, however. See it, but not with your expectations too high.


                
Is this one big joke I'm not in on? I can understand how people might like LOTR (although I thought the series was...boring), but Million Dollar Baby was just horrible. I don't think Eastwood could have jammed more over-used clichés in if he tried. Morgan Freeman played the same character he does in every movie these days (I actually laughed out loud when I heard he was nominated for an Oscar). The writing was awful, the acting was bad...so why did everyone like it??? Some brilliant "foreign films" have come out, but the award shows group them into one category...so we are left with pathetic attempts at cinema like this to celebrate.


                
Slow, slow, slow. The only reason this movie got an Oscar is because Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are in it. And because it is about someone with the "heart of a champion." Some champion. If anyone made a movie that: glorified the mercy killing of American slaves before the Civil War rather than live a life of slavery, glorified the mercy killing of women who are abused and would be living a horrible life anyway, or glorified the mercy killing of someone who was blind and couldn't see anything anyway, they would be publicly scorned for the implication that these people lead lives that have less value than those of others. However, the media and critics everywhere have latched onto this movie and raved. Thank God for Clint Eastwood, otherwise, our "champion" might have gone through life disabled. Which is, apparently, now in the eyes of Hollywood, a fate worse than death. An insult to every disabled person in the United States and an unbearably destructive twist to an otherwise inspiring movie.
It seems it's been done before and better. Some very talented work here, but the sum is far less than the parts. The very talented Morgan Freeman is made to drone on in narrative, much like in the Shawshank Redemption (where it had greater effect), but is hampered by poorer writing. Hilary Swank is also very talented, but also has to muscle past mediocre (at best) writing. How Clint Eastwood has sustained a career is a testament to "it's not what you know but who you know". This is the Hollywood Complex cranking up the mood lighting and calling it "art". But I suppose I should be thankful that it didn't contain a load of shaky camera work or jittery editing in the fight scenes. Maybe it can be recommended on that little bit of artistic backbone. It seems lately that any movie portraying action is out to induce a maximum of epileptic fits.


                
I realize that there are a lot of people who like this film, but I for one hated this one. I like Clint and Morgan movies. This one was just too much copy and paste from their roles in other movies. Morgan sounds like he is back at shawshank redemption. Clint plays his traditional tough guy role and Hillary comes across as the tom-boy. There was nothing in this movie that one hasn't seen in other movies from these actors and actress before. The boxing scenes weren't even exciting and the whole story line is not even original. There are scenes that are suppose to be real sad, but all the characters are hard-boiled people who try not to show emotions...and it just didn't come across as a movie that elicits any sympathy. Nothing. Bottomline, full of clichés, nothing new and just Clint's name bringing the Oscar home to an otherwise substance-less movie.


                
The problem is in the details. Every cliché from ever boxing film before it is used, from the two versions of The Champ, to John Garfield films, to Jimmy Cagney's City For Conquest, to Kirk Douglas's Champion, to the Rocky films, Raging Bull, and the earlier girl fight film, Girlfight. Name a scene in this film and it's a cliché. Eastwood's trainer, Franky Dunn, speaks in a hoarse, gruff manner like Burgess Meredith's Mickey from the Rocky films. Whenever his fighter, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), is losing a fight, Franky spouts a cliché like, 'She's younger, stronger, and a better fighter than you. What're you gonna do about it?' Wham-bam- she knocks out her opponent. Dunn's lone employee at the gym he owns, the Hit Pit, where Maggie shows up in, is an old washed up, one-eyed boxer-cum-janitor (cliché) played by Morgan Freeman (as Scrap Dupris), in another of his trite Wise, Old Negro roles. Freeman's character also narrates the film, punctuating the clichéd scenes, cardboard acting, and all the rest with the most obvious of restatements of what we have just witnessed. Let's see- what other clichés? There is a retarded boxer named Danger (Jay Baruchel), whom Scrap takes under his wing. There is a cocky fighter named Shawrelle Berry (Anthony Mackie), who thinks he's hot. Of course, he beats the crap out of Danger, only to have blind old Scrap kick his ass with only a single punch. This pabulum that has nothing to do with the actual film's narrative, and serves only to give Freeman his Oscar moment, is almost as bad as the whole premise of the film- that anyone gives a damn about female boxing. To take the film's version of reality, one would think that female boxing is at the height of where male boxing was last century. Even male boxing is in the dumps. Female boxing is a joke sport- right there with obstacles course running with kitchen appliances strapped to your back. Perhaps the most obvious cliché comes when an up and coming boxer of Franky's stabs him in the back to go with another manager, then wins a title.Those are merely the boxing movie clichés<U+0085>. As for the technical aspects, Eastwood's palette is always limited, his 'key' moments always muddily filmed. Too often, characters wander in and out of frame, which suggests a poorly constructed scene. And, to come full circle, the DVD is a ripoff, with nothing of any real value. Many single DVD films have far more than this bloated 2 DVD set. Pass on this film and find a good version of Champion or City For Conquest, instead.
We never really get to know the boxer in this film, she remains to the end a one-dimensional caricature and Eastwood's character was entirely unlikeable throughout. Freeman's narration was too eerily similar to Shawshank Redemption and seemed to have no real importance to the overall story, along with the rest of the gym's boring denizens.Although Swank does a good job with the material she is given, her dialogue never seems to transcend "oh golly gee boss." She is a great actress and was breathtaking in Boys Don't Cry, but in this - she was cardboard. What was her attraction to boxing and to Frankie Dunn? Who knows. Who cares. Apparently, that was incidental to the story.Evil Germans, stupid White Trash, a saintly janitor, and a boxer that rises to the top in 1 year with barely any training - where have we seen this all before? This is a pro euthanasia movie that doesn't even make an attempt to show the other side. The Eastwood character unilaterally takes the law into his own hands without due process or legal recourse and murders the boxer. Sickening and not a good message after the Terri Schaivo debacle. I wonder how much of the hype for this movie is out of political motivation for its seedy message.The unrealistic boxing, the grating narration, the nasty priest, the meaningless sideshow characters, and the hackneyed clichés that riddled the film seem in the end to have all been mere plot vehicles to depict how wonderful euthanasia is. If that is the case, shame on you Clint.Clint Eastwood has great talent and his Mystic River was an excellent movie but he can't seem to get past his Dirty Harry persona. I've seen enough of it already but apparently most people haven't judging by the undeserved awards this film garnered.This is the most over-hyped mediocrity since American Beauty. 20 years from now it will be entirely forgotten.
I can think of no way to better summarize this movie other than "Not worth watching twice", accept maybe "not worth watching once".*Spoiler alert* Perhaps the most memorable thing from this movie (other than Morgan Freeman's outstanding performance- the only reason for the "twice" in the summary) Is the fact that the main character is paralyzed for the last 40 minutes of a movie that is barely over 2 hours in length (sans the credits). With a third of the movie left, I felt that Swank's character would most definitely recover, but no, the inactivity lasted for a full 40 min until the boredom made it feel as if I myself was the one stuck paralyzed in a hospital bed.A typical outstanding performance by Freeman, a mediocre one by Eastwood, and a sappy performance by Swank which I found to be quite lacking, makes up the majority of the cast of what is surely the worst "Best Picture" yet.
"Million Dollar Baby" is, quite simply, the worst movie in memory to win an Oscar for Best Picture. The movie only became interesting following Maggie's having been injured. The gym scenes are ludicrous. Clint Eastwood should be embarrassed for his putting such silly crud onto film. Maggie's been train for how long and she cannot hit a speed bag? And was Danger retarded? If so, the portrayal of someone who is retarded by Jay Baruchel was ridiculous, if not retarded in itself. Then, the gym tough guy gets his lights punched out by an old man, former fighter Morgan Freeman? What a joke. That would be akin to Joe Montana, at age 50, engineering the winning drive in the Super Bowl. It ain't gonna happen. Then, could the white trash family of Maggie have been anymore stereotypical? Screenplay writer Paul Haggis' work is, to me, a joke. During Maggie's title bout, she is repeatedly and flagrantly fouled by her opponent . . . yet the referee does nothing? What a joke! Even the gruff voices of Eastwood and Freeman characters are ripoffs of the trainer of Rocky, played by Burgess Merideth. And could the dialogue between Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and the priest have been any more corny? While people have said, "This is not a boxing movie", it is a movie in which boxing was used as a vehicle for a message. The problem is, the boxing portion of the movie is horrendous. I am a huge fan of boxing. Given how Eastwood and Haggis portrayed boxing, they should have used cheerleading as a way of getting Maggie injured. That way, they could have used something they might have more easily understood. As it was, they made it abundantly clear that their understanding of boxing is abysmal, at best.
Whats with the face lift, Clint? That was your instrument, your face, and we all enjoyed seeing you age in a gracious way. Now, you look hideous and I'll never want to see you on screen again.Oh, and this movie! How you got such raves, I'll never know. You had a pretty good story brewing about the trainer finding a surrogate daughter, but to let it mire down into a euthanasia dilemma was farcical. And it was the wrong kind of case to be seriously considered in that (medical ethical) light. You could have used a chimp. It would have been the most believable character.It's time to quit while you still have some credibility in the film world.
Ms Swank shows us that her upbringing served her well. She didn't need to act, just bring back the little trailer girl that brought her to adulthood. She was wooden and boring, although almost believable as a woman who wanted to box (go figure!), and wouldn't listen to her "coach". I just never felt the least little bit about her. It was actually a relief to have the movie end as it did so I wouldn't hear her "boss man" thing even one more time. Clint Eastwood did not do himself proud on this one, although Morgan Freeman was excellent. I am shocked and amazed that this little movie got nominated for anything, let along won. Guess this is proof that one can just pay off the academy for awards. Wasted my evening. Good thing I didn't have any other plans that night.


                
In 1995 Hootie and the Blowfish were everywhere, they were the number 1 album in the country, they were all over the radio, and now? Now Hootie is dressed up on TV like Porter Wagoner selling burgers. What happened? It was all hype; America has to have a #1, has to have something to hype, and since nothing was better than Hootie that year, it was number one by default; not really that good, just all hype - and so is this movie.Look at its competition - Ray and The Aviator. I'm no racist, but is there really that much demand for a movie about Ray Charles? Next time your friends start that "Ray Charles was a musical genius" talk, say, "Wow, you must be a big fan, how many of his albums do you have?". The response will sound like this, "Well, I don't actually have any of his albums, but...". Again, recently-dead-man-PC-correct hype; but still just hype. The Aviator is at least 20 years too late coming out. I was born in '67 and barely recall hearing of Howard Hughes when he died. Ask anyone under 30 who he was and they may know. Ask them why he's rich and famous and they'll have no clue. Supporting my theory again, Million Dollar Baby is #1 by default, there's nothing better right now to hype.Let's break it down: It was TOO long and too slow. Why was Clint estranged from his daughter? We don't know, they never bothered to tell us. The truth is Clint should give his Oscar to Dana Reeves, Superman's wife, because this movie is Christopher Reeve's story, just minus the horse accident. In real life sometimes strong people get hurt accidentally and they die - the end. That's life, but it's not a very good movie. A better movie <U+0096> A) They tell us more of the girl's terrible upbringing and show her awful family more, and she becomes heavyweight champion (okay, it's called Rocky and we've seen that already). B) She fights to overcome the neck injury and regains limited mobility and (semi) defeats paralysis (I'm sure this has been done too, I just don't know what it was called). C) She really can't get better, but Clint loves her as his surrogate daughter (because they've better explained where is real daughter is) and he cares for her the rest of her life because he finally learned to love somebody (again, probably been done). Any of those beat what we got.Lastly, if you kill somebody, you don't just go have lemon pie; I'd bet the police might want to see you. And, I'm not Catholic, but a priest who drops the F-bomb at church, I don't think so. So be a "Hootie" sheep or see this picture for what it really ain't.
We went to see this movie with great anticipation because the trailers that I had seen were very upbeat. The movie had a good story going for it until the last scenes. Had they stopped the movie at that point of her tragic injury it would be a 'thumbs up'. However, after her injury until the end of the movie it was a real downer. It amounted to nothing more than emotional voyeurism. There is much tragedy in the world that is real and sad. This movie simply angered me because of the juxtaposition of the comedy and the tragedy. The acting was very good, but the actors deserved a better script. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this movie a solid 2.
The story for Million Dollar Baby is darn near impossible to define in precise terms. What starts out as not only an engaging and exhilarating boxing drama but also an emotionally stirring divulgence into the belief of second chances quickly, and all too suddenly, shifts gears into a pure propagandist piece. Why did things have to go so disturbingly wrong? The first two-thirds of the film showcased some of the most heart-warming, breathtaking, and all-out inspirational boxing sequences this side of Raging Bull. Truly an Oscar tour-de-force from everyone involved. And then they had to go about and kill it, so to speak, with a conclusion that felt as if someone had side-checked the audience into a brick wall.Clint Eastwood, in the role of the hard-shelled <U+0096> are not all his characters that way <U+0096> boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, was mainly nominated for his performance due to his marquee name <U+0096> Giamatti deserved it more <U+0096> but the character itself is too wild for even the most Hollywood of clichés. It is both an appalling and disturbing sight to see critics and the public alike applaud a performance in which Eastwood comes in at the end of the film through the hospital wing like the "Angel of Death" to secretly kill a woman he raised as if she were his own daughter. Perhaps audience members were given the wrong perception on the real daughter that left him. Maybe she was the only one with the true sense about her. If you knew your father would end up doing what he did to Maggie, would you not leave him? Hilary Swank is obviously on tap to receive the Oscar for Best Actress this year at the Academy Awards for her performance as boxer in training Maggie Fitzgerald, but does she truly deserve the honor or rather is there a serious lack of true competition against her? Should she receive kudos for training excruciatingly hard for the role and floating gracefully around the boxing ring like a true woman champion? Sure, she deserves every bit of it. Should she be the one to receive two golden statuettes in such a short period of time while taking lead roles in such trash as The Core and The Gift? Not so sure about that one. Maggie also acts as a rather crude insult toward anyone from the South <U+0096> in fact her entire family could actually be brought into this discussion while we are at it. In Million Dollar Baby, every individual who happens to be from the southern region of the country is portrayed as either a know-nothing country bumpkin, complete with inbred appearance, or a worthless piece of white trash that will never amount to anything in this world. This is the typical cliché of both Hollywood and the liberal establishment in general. They love it so much it kills them to see over and over again <U+0096> if only.Overall, Michael Moore occultists, more accurately those left who have yet to buck up the nerve to take their Kool-Aid following the reelection of Bush-Hitler, can at most find some consolation in the fact that at least some left-wing propagandist piece could walk away with a golden statuette on Oscar night. Already the fringe leftists have a pathetic excuse for their bumbling actions claiming, "But at least Frankie was not cruel enough to do the deed while she was sleeping. Was it not the most touching moment when they said their good-byes before the end?" Sure, perhaps someone could try explaining that one to the family of the victim of the next teenage girl that is humanely raped and murdered after her attacker had already threatened to kill her to begin with. Straight out, euthanasia is nothing more then a gussied up word used by liberal elitists to cover-up the act of cold-blooded murder, accepted only by the slack-jawed idiots churned out by donkey universities who can not put two-and-two together. "But", they stutter "should we truly allow those who are confined to wheelchairs, unable to move a single limb, live out the rest of their purposeless lives in utter agony?" Following that sense of logic, Christopher Reeve, in spite of whatever Brother John Edwards may believe, should have been put of his damn misery years before he actually died. This should not be a complex issue to get through anyone's head, no matter how thick they may be. Your life does not belong solely to you, it belongs to the creator. God created you specifically in his image with a purpose in this life, though we may not know it at the time, and he will take you from this world when he feels it is your determined time. You do not have the privilege of making that decision for him in any event. In spite of what some radical liberals may tell you, man is not higher up on the chain-of-command then God himself. Anything to the contrary is absolute sacrilege. In addition to that, Baby promotes the ideal that if you are able to reach the zenith of your life, the one true shot at the big time, that even if you fail doing so you will have achieved your purpose in this world and you may therefore die with a sense of dignity having nothing left to live for. Perhaps that one could be explained more clearly to Eastwood, whether he actually wins on the big night or not, by taking a quick pot-shot to his head on his way to the limo. After all, does it not make sense for him to practice what he preaches? Million Dollar Baby is positively insulting, bordering on the line of being flat-out slanderous, both to Catholicism and the dignity of humanity in general. There should be no respect left for Clint Eastwood, either in the realm of films or politics, after this travesty.
I did not get it. Frankie has lost fighters because he never let them fight for titles. And when he finally does, it goes to H***. What did that tell him and us? Never fight for titles?He has a daughter but that story never leads anywhere. The mails are returned to sender all through the movie.He goes to church and see a priest that is unwise and unkind and that does not develop either.Until we meet Maggies mother I thought that Frankie was her father, why else would she stick to him?And then Maggie breaks her neck and is paralyzed. That does not lead anywhere either. And again, what was that supposed to tell us? That fame has its price?The only thing interesting in this movie is Maggies relation with her mother.
Granted I haven't read the collection of short stories the 70 year old that wrote what this movie is based on did. Being that they were just that, short stories, I doubt that the entire film's materials was taken from just one of them.I found that this was a boxing movie that didn't focus much on boxing. They explained it by saying she won all her matches in the first round. Has there ever existed such a boxer? Not even Rocky was that good! The disappointment for me, however, doesn't come from the lack of boxing footage, but from the lack of story explanation. What happened between Eastwood's character and his wife? They divorced, separated or what? Why does his daughter hate him so? Why does Hollywood feel the need to continue to mock anyone of religious faith, including having the (Episcopal?) priest using bad language and calling Eastwood's character a liar for saying he was writing his daughter, when the audience is shown he was writing her and that his letters were returned.Why does he decide to murder her (assist her suicide) and take off? Where on earth was the hospital staff and why did no one hear the noise of the monitors while he was killing her? Supposedly a clue is dropped that he went to the diner that served lemon pie without it coming from the can, but why? Because he went against what the priest told him to do and felt that was the closest to heaven he could get after '2' unforgivable sins? A lot of questions, but not many answers. But then I guess that's what film making is about these days. Pathos above moral values. Emotions rather than any logical sequence or rhyme or reason.When Clint Eastwood was asked about why the assisted suicide scene in an interview, he stated that the movie wasn't making an argument for it. But it sure wasn't making one against it. It even seemed that Morgan Freeman's character looked at that decision as a good one as he wrote the letter to Eastwood's daughter.In a year full of weak movie entries (the fact that idiot Michael Moore even tried to get consideration for best picture showed that HE knew it was a weak field), this film was a cut above the other mediocrity, but it's lack of moral values and degradation of life and the importance of what God thinks brings this down to one of the most mediocre movies to receive as many Oscar nominations as it did that I can remember.See it by all means, but be prepared for disappointment if you are a person of faith or care about life.
