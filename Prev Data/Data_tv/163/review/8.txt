A beautiful tribute to the 90s with small invaluable details in every minute of the staging and writing. If you were 5 or older in the 90s, there's no way you won't enjoy this series. I just wish it was shot better. Once you accept the way it's been shot, the story, casting and direction will hold you throughout.


                
The series is something which this generation of kids need to watch. Harshu, the protagonist is exactly what we were as teenager of the ninetees. Set in 1998 this is a story of Harshu and his life as a teenager. The adolescent boy facing the tests and tribulations of growing up. A family of five where the mother is a housewife and the father an insurance agent. The three kids and Shanky, Harshus best friend are the main attraction of the series. Right from pickpocketing from the father's wallet to hiding movie tickets inside books are what we grew up with. The embarrassing birthday parties, the sibling fights everything will take the Eightees kid to the glorious past when there was no cell phone or Internet. The days when using a cordless phone was thrilling. From the first crush to a sibling leaving home for further studies this series is a tear-jerker at times. A perfect family drama with the kids psychology kept in mind. A must watch.
It was a great series. It can connect to anyones childhood memories.. the bond and attachments to siblings and parents was soo real. In other words just watch and relive your childhood.
