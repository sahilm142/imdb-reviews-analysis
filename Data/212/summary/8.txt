 A smartly modern elegy.

 Lest the Dramatic Structure be Stillborn

 Love for dogs or for money?

 Panting Astrology

 Life in Mexico, folks.

 Stark depiction of modern Mexican society

 ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT

 Thoughtful, engrossing but overlong

 A film that made it onto numerous top ten lists in 2000, Amores Perros is an overlapping consideration of the crises of love as it wavers in and out of reciprocity.

 It's dog-eat-dog in a godless world<U+0085>

 The things we do for love

 You won't be the same, after you have seen this corroding movie !

 I Like This Movie

 Not original, but it impressed me

 Excellent Drama With Plenty of Dogs

 Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu's Feature Film Debut Is An Instant Classic

 The flawed nature of the human being

 Thank-goodness for dogs, Gloria Kroger

 Interesting, well acted and moving

 Introducing Inarritu

 Very good, not amazing and a bit long, but clever, and the acting is superb.

 Violent and Coarse, But also very very Powerful

 All people who do bad things will pay in the end.
