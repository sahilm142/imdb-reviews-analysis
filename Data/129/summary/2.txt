 A Terrible Misfire...

 Extremely overrated

 Not what it says on the tin

 The emperor has no clothes, people--this film is UNWATCHABLE

 This film is making a political point

 Over Hyped

 Violent and horrible

 Pan Labyrinth Review

 Most over-hyped WAR story

 Labyrinths of useless violence

 a nightmare-a bedtime story-a grim fairy tale

 Del Toro's Boring Sadism Too Much!

 Where was the masterpiece?

 Imagined fantasy? *Spoilers*

 What Labyrinth?

 if you didn't notice this is propaganda

 Your Life Depends On It

 Sick and depressing,damn you critics

 The trailer gives no reference to subtitles at all!
