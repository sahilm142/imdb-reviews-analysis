 A Nutshell Review: Incendies

 Wonderful and devastating

 Superb Film

 Incendies

 Better than Greek Tragedy!

 A rare piece of gem!!!

 ¨ ........... My Heart is Inconsolably Broken. ¨

 A stunning and powerful thriller

 Amazingly constructed film but not for everyone

 Greek x Shakespearian tragedy

 reading of a will leads to long & winding odyssey into unknown worlds

 Beautifully haunting.

 Best Movie Ever

 Full of tears
