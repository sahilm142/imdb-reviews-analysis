Reading all of the comments here on IMDB i decided to watch Masum. Its very slow development made me sick but i wanted to see the final. I couldn't understand what the writer of the show was thinking but after watching hours and hours of meaningless dialogue i became irritated by the stupid motives of the characters. The human beings in this show (especially in the final episode) tends to behave abnormally and absurdly only to make surprises to watchers who are bored by the long non-necessary dialogues. The inconsistency of the reasons and the results of the incidents are laughable. If the writers of Turkish TV series (yes all of them) are reading this i want to say something to them : Please go out from your houses, connect with people and work hard at least to make characters close to real and believable. Nothing makes sense if you are living lonely in a weird unreal world and use only your stupid imagination to create characters and incidents.
