 Good new elements (although some are too much)

 A well written show

 Great series, but it could have been better.

 A new avatar, totally different experience from its predecessor

 Flirting with greatness

 Heart-warming, Yet Action Packed Series

 Entertaning but shallow

 Doesn't compare to the Original

 very good, not yet there

 Good, but not TLA

 Action-packed

 Rocky start, strong end

 Fast and bad

 A whole myriad of emotions, exciting, and enjoyable

 ups and downs, yet excellent overall performance

 Not as good as Avatar: The Last Airbender, but still a promising start
