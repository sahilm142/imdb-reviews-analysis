 A motion picture that dares to be excessive...

 Brutal, But Epic Masterpiece

 Wallace's courage is inspiring

 9.5/10 - Freeeeeeeeeeeedom!

 Best of this era

 Simply Breathtaking,

 The epic story of William Wallace

 Gibson's best as director- melodramatic in better than expected measure, with bloody violence

 Braveheart: One for the Ages

 Kilts have never looked manlier

 Amazing Movie about being a Man!

 Braveheart has always and always will be one of my favorites

 A top-hole film - Braveheart is medieval epic film-making at its best!

 Fiery!!

 Absolutely brilliant

 Mel Gibson you magnificent bastard!

 I like it

 Not a History Lesson, but a great war film

 My legend movie

 Great Scots! Watch this movie! Every man dies, not every man truly lives to see a great film like this.

 MY REVIEW: The Epic Tale of Bravery and Heart!!

 Braveheart Is one of the Best Movies Ever Made!!

 A true masterpiece
