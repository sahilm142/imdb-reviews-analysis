This is the first silent film I have ever seen, so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound (other than the piano in the background) in a 90 minute movie. So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas across.I felt like they did some of same gags over and over again, like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove. It just got really old to me quickly. I don't know maybe because I'm from a different time period and way life but the film just didn't do anything for me. I didn't really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only 30 to 40 minutes long and nothing would have been lost.


                
I cannot follow the praise of that movie by other viewers. Unlike his later works (such as The Circus, Modern Times, Citylights) the plot is thin and not well writen. The directing has many flaws, the scenes often ending abruptly with no clear link to the following. I love Chaplin films, but this one was disappointing.
