Yes, there are beautiful wide-angle views of our PLANET EARTH. But they form ONLY about 15% of this documentary. The majority, about 80% of this movie, is about animals eating one another.Photographing animals is relatively easy and cheap, while photographing truly beautiful, wide-angle views of our Earth is very expensive and time-consuming. And obvious they knew it, which is why this movie is given the misleading title of "PLANET EARTH", instead of the correct title "ANIMALS ON PLANET EARTH". I don't want to call this cheating<U+0085>.As I said, yes, there are some great photos showing the beauty of the Earth. But even these are beginning to show signs of age. The blu-ray version of this movie is in VC-1, an old, not that HD format, now abandoned by everyone.One thing I dislike most is seeing a narrator jumping into your view and start talking nonsense, while I was in the middle of enjoying the beauty of a scene. This guy seemed to do this in many of the BBC nature documentaries. Luckily, he refrained from do it in this movie. Maybe they have spent too much money on this documentary and don't want it ruined<U+0085> BTW, if you are interested in the beauty of the Earth, rather than in animals eating one another, Frozen Planet might be a better choice, although it unfortunately covers only the poles.
