I was looking forward to watching this series.I started paying the 1st episode and it took only 3 min and 22 sec until I couldn't take it any more.Since it is about the computer-science world (also mine) I was expecting something smart, bright. Instead, we are flooded with profanity from the very first seconds. People should understand that profanity is not humour! I worked in the comedian environment and it is common knowledge that a bad comedian getting a weak reaction from the audience will resort to profanity. Depending on how low the average intellect of the audience is they might warm a little.It is the case with this series. Their "jokes" seem to be just tons of profanity. I know a lot of people in this field (software, hardware etc) and they are very far from those filthy-mouthed characters I could watch in 3 min.I do wonder why it got such a big score on IMDb.
