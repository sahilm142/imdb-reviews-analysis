 I had to run to IMDb to review this one.

 Give it a watch.

 Damn Good Show

 If you're an Amy Sherman Palladino fan - this should be your cup of tea

 Entertaining and yet it left me disappointed

 Rachel Brosnahan finally gets her own show and it's Marvelous!!!

 A must see!

 Excellent show!

 Please don't let them get back together!

 Much to Like, But Finding Fault with Minor Details

 A nice set-up for the upcoming series.

 A fun show that continues to pick up steam

 Amazing production value, refreshing topic, funny and incredibly well written

 Excellent plot and an outstanding execution

 Season 2 was more amazing then the first but the last episode...Really..

 Wonderful Writing

 What a treat...

 A different series

 LOL Really Means Laugh Out Loud

 This made me very happy

 Great show looking for the second season

 Hidden Star? Willing to be a bit player

 Keeps Getting Better

 Magic

 Amazing show
