 Just what the Doctor ordered.

 Falls short

 Strange beginnings

 It started out well, but then became way too cerebral

 Hannibal is an incomplete dish

 Polarizing.....but give it time

 Pretentious art and engaging suspense

 On the whole a good series

 good but not enough

 Surprised at how good this is

 Good but starting a very slow decline.

 No logic but enjoyable

 Dark and entertaining but not quiet as intelligent as it pretends to be

 The Good, Bad and Ugly!

 Above expectations

 Great, if not quite perfect

 Season 1 and 2 excellent... Season 3 not so much.

 Great Opening season that falters towards the end

 Excellent start, what happened?
