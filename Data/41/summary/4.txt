 Disappointment

 What a mess

 No respect!

 Overrated

 Like comparing a brick with a samurai sword

 That's It Hollywood, Just Keep Slaughtering Those Foreign Flicks

 F for the Departed

 Marty would have won the Oscar if he used trained chimps in this movie...

 Drawn out mob movie with a few twists

 Vastly Overrated. Worst "Good Film" of 2006 POSSIBLE SPOILERS

 not so great

 One Negative Vote (Spoilers)

 Ridiculously Over-hyped

 Departed is Never close to being Good.

 User Rating: 8.5/10?? why?

 Under-written and under-whelming

 OK... I am biased, but it doesn't worth an Oscar

 I beg your pardon?

 Better watch the original – <U+0084>Infernal affairs"

 Too long, too noisy, too boring - a pastiche

 Great movie, great adaptation but hardly original

 Loose Ends, Unrealistic, Too Long

 I don't know if we watched the same film

 Not as good as internal affairs

 Departed
