 One of THE best DC cartoons of all time, in my opinion.

 BEST OF THE BEST - 10/10 - GREAT

 DC - This is the Series We Needed and the One We Need Right Now!

 Second season picks up fast

 DC got it right

 Young Justice is the follow-up to the DC-Animated-Universe we all deserved.

 Better than Teen Titans

 It was the best!

 'Independence Day' or 'All we want to do is save the world!'

 One of Cartoon Network's best shows in recent years, not perfect but terrific all the same

 Best!!!

 Too awesome for words

 DC - Best super hero series, addictive and awesome

 A great show that I would highly recommend to anyone

 Excellent Show

 Best DC show ever

 Gone too Soon

 Pretty Much a Perfect Show!!

 Quite possibly the best superhero team ever put together

 Great first season, however...

 Surprisingly good

 It's just the best DC animation out there

 Young Justice is back!

 ITS BACK!

 Best superhero cartoon after Batman. And it's closer then most would think! It's a sin it was cancelled...
