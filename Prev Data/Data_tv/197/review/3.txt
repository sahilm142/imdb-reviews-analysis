I bailed out after just two episodes of Season One. I didn't like ANY of the characters; Soderbergh's dialogue is incredibly clumsy and undramatic; the acting is wooden; the staging is unnatural. . . . need I go on?Wait, one thing more: it's tainted with the smug sense of superiority to the past common to so many modern shows: why don't these stupid, bigoted people see things the "right way."  Anachronism Alert: back then, no one addressed you by your first name, except family (and very close friends). The custom then was to use the last name - Smith, Jones, for example - preceded by a title, if justified, like Mr, Mrs, Miss, Dr, Professor, etc. Today this persists only in the armed forces. Excess "familiarity" was a serious breach of etiquette.On the meagre plus side, the settings and costumes are interesting. So beware when you take characters with contemporary attitudes and set them down in the past. Unless you have something new to say (which "The Knick," unfortunately, does not), you simply subject them, bare of support or context, to the critical gaze of the audience and expose how thin, tired, trite, clichéd and boring they are.
