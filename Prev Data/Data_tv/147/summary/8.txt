 Big Little Show

 I watched it already twice

 Sharp, funny, highly entertaining motherly crises

 Superb! (Disappointed at criticism on people's claims this is a "targeted audience" show therefore deserving a poor review.)

 I don't lie saying that you don't regret seeing it

 Absolutely one of the best

 there's something wrong with our lives

 Slice of life series appreciated by many

 Wonderful TV Show By Great Acting by the Trio and MUST WATCH

 Gotta love this show!

 Big Little Masterpiece

 Very captivating story about the women here

 Wowza!

 How does the incidental become a nuclear explosion?

 Slow start but awesome finale

 Who Dunnit? and to who?

 A show with a satisfying conclusion

 Compelling drama mini-series

 Envy with madness and it shows that proper adults have anguish with secrets.

 Kids Psychology

 Promising

 A fantastic murder mystery.

 All the money in the world can't buy a perfect life

 Great but a bit predictable.
