This movie is hard to watch. It's so boring to the point that it gets annoying.
The 2 main caracters are played by the worst actors, the action is just missing. The only reason i gave 2 stars insetad of 1 is because Pablo appears in one of the episodes. Best 3 minutes of the entire series.
How can this movie have a better score than Narcos, the original, beats me!


                
I just can't consentrate, nothing is keeping me on my chair. Bad, and really dissapointing


                
I have read the Spanish speaking Parts of the show made it "authentic", I say good writing, directing, And acting make a movie or show Authentic. All you have to do is watch the movie Scarface. If I wanted to read I pick up a book. I truly want to be able to rate this show Much higher but I cannot. You release the show or movie in the United States have the courtesy to do so in our native language, English! I will not apologize for expecting any less. You want our money and appreciation for your work, then please respect your viewers. I do not expect to go into another country and have them learn my language I would ask the same of everyone else. It is ridiculous many of those who have reviewed the show do you not the only way I could feel authentic is to have read subtitles . I suffered through season one but not sure I'll be able to make season two or three. Perhaps if there is a four he will show us the courtesy have all the dialogue in English, there are many excellent Hispanic actors to speak both languages and in fact sound authentic even when they are speaking English.
