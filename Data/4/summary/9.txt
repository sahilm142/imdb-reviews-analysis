 A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions

 A stupendous effort that needed a little tweaking.

 everything I wanted it to be, from a comics freak

 "The Dark Knight" finally realizes the full potential of the Batman mythology

 When the greatest figure is disfigured... and the mastermind is out of his...

 If not 'the dark knight'....then nothing

 all star cast all star results

 Does What it Set Out To Do

 The Dark Knight Breaks Comic Book Adaptation Barriers.

 The Joker is Real

 Joker darker than the Dark Knight

 Simplicity is beauty.

 Falls short of greatness

 Not for kids!

 Over-hyped and Convoluted

 The Noir Card

 Well worth staying up

 Awesome Movie

 Is this is a Comic Book Movie?

 A Superhero Masterpiece...

 Close to perfection

 Darker than Burton's?

 Late TDK review

 Amazing film, Dark but great

 Holy Crap it was amazing.
