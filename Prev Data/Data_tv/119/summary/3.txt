 I thought nothing could kill Dr. Who...

 I wanted Jodie to succeed, but...

 The Doctor has regenerated into an SJW.

 I'm forcing myself through every episode

 Drwho not a natural progression

 Become too PC

 Really weak story line

 season 11 sucks

 Was Great until 2018 series

 Very disappointed with series 11 (2018)

 Not Deserving Three Star

 The Doctor Falls Indeed

 Starts out good then declines.

 Good Actress, very weak scripts

 Dr Who in transition

 Great show except for the latest season

 Shocking decline

 Season 10 Finale - Fall of the Doctor

 What have they done to Doctor Who?!

 A female Doctor?

 A Step Too Far From The Original

 What's this - hipster Doctor Who? I miss the 1970s.

 Good Doctor..... being let down by poor stories

 Dr who is slipping in credibility

 It's very disappointing
