 A sprawling space opera full of humor and action.

 I was smiling almost all the way through

 Bold, brave and beautifully weird.

 A pleasant surprise, or how I stopped being afraid and again fell in love with blockbusters

 Whackos of the Galaxy

 Almost on par with the Avengers

 We believe in MARVEL

 Not your original Marvel experience

 A Familiar Yet Refreshing Experience! Witty and Intelligent, Maybe Marve's Best!

 Awesome, hilarious, great film!

 A Film Like None Other

 Haters gonna hate but...
