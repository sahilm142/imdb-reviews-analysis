It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, "Up", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.It was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist—on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.The montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, "Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.When we finally meet up with the long lost "Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.The film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.In the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels. There is only one direction Pixar can go from now on<U+0085>and that is up!
I'm a big fan of pixar movies, I think finding nemo, ratatouille and Wall-E (though to be fair I didn't like Wall-e either the first time I saw it) are some of the best examples of narrative storytelling in the last 20 years. Simply put, the Pixar clan know how to tell stories.That's why I was so surprised when I saw up. Now, maybe my expectations are too high, but I found it to be one of the weaker Pixar efforts. And here's a few reasons why.1. It draws on associated emotion, not real emotion. Much of the sadness in the film (and this is a sad - not happy movie) isn't earned. It comes from referencing other films and our own associations - specifically at the beginning. The opening montage goes by so quickly, as a scrap book, that it falls upon cliché to create the emotion. Granted, for many people this will work, because to be honest, there's something affecting about seeing cartoons go through "serious" emotions. Yet, these scenes lack the depth of having our characters go through real actions and real feelings. Things happen, the characters don't do anything - they let things happen to them. (and example is that Russel's (spoiler) parents are divorced. This scene is handled in a clichéd and associated way. So and so's not my mom! Heard that one before...) If you enjoyed the opening montage, watch Mr. Holland's opus - that movie does this same thing better.2. This movie isn't funny. All of the best jokes are used in the trailers/commercials. Much of the comedy is played too subtly (not subtle, but too subtle) and passed over too quickly. There's never a clear moment of what the movie is trying to make us feel at any given time - which brings me to 3. Tone. Is this a comedy, is it a melodrama? The movie doesn't really know what it is or is trying to say. It's inconsistencies constantly set up a new series of expectations which are never followed through on. It's serious...I'm thinking it's going to ... oh wait, a joke...wait...4. The narrative. The movie takes about 2 acts to find itself as a movie. Carl meanders though the film trying to take his South America. He wants to put his house down, and every 2 minutes a new complication arrives. Then, in the third act, he battles the old and now evil (how old is this guy supposed to be if Carl is 78?) Charles Muntz. He comes to defend russel and dug, and the bird. He finds a purpose - the movie finds itself as a movie! Finally...but by then we've spent 2 acts trying to get into another story completely.4A. there are a lot of clever storytelling devices, there is a good story here. It's a matter of the storytelling and dramatic devices the filmmakers use to elucidate that the story that are weak.5. The characters. Between Carl and Russel (shout out to the Asian community) we have a weak set of characters. The most interesting character, Ellie, dies. Her passive husband is left - the into to him shows how awesome she is. What did she see in him anyway? what did he do? Russel is kind of an idiot spaz. why should I root for someone who's so incompetent? If Pixar can animate characters with big heads and big eyes, everyone will think it's cute. Great date movies, great for kids, and hipsters. The overall storytelling I felt was pretty weak in UP. It felt like it was rushed off without knowing precisely where it was going - which is a joy to watch in the other pixar movies. Brad Bird and Andrew Stanton make you feel like you're in the hands of a master who is taking good care you - who is guiding you and surprising you, but never doing something you're not enjoying. Up is very muddled film-making. It's not horrible, but it's much weaker than the other films.cheers.
The posters and trailers for "Up" make you think that this movie is about a flying house. Well, not really. Here's a film that starts with an interesting, Jules Verne-like premise and then basically ignores it.The film's central notion, the flying house, is not integrated with the plot in any meaningful way, and that's a big problem! Because how can we accept the flying house as real if it feels so tacked on? In the "Toy Story" films it was very important that the characters were toys, in "Ratatouille" is was similarly crucial that Rémy was a rat, because those things established certain possibilities and limitations, and the plot seemed to evolve quite reasonably from these. Within the universes those movies inhabited, their plots and gags made sense. But in "Up", the flying house is purely a gimmick, an afterthought, and that makes the movie seem relatively weak in comparison to other Pixar films like "A Bug's Life", "Monsters, Inc.", and even "Cars".Sure, "Up" is occasionally quite funny (but no funnier than say, the average Tex Avery cartoon, and that South American bird certainly looks very Road Runner-ish when it's first introduced), but still the question remains, why the flying house? I mean how exactly would the plot have been any different if they had simply taken a plane to South America or even used a Star Trek-style transporter to get there?And for supposedly being about travel and exploration, this movie sure does not spend a lot of time traveling. Getting to South America and back only takes a cut and a little dialogue. Thus the similarity to the transporter. And the vistas in South America basically all look the same (rocks, sand, and vegetation), so visually this movie is hardly stunning. In fact the sand only seems to turn up whenever a character either has to leave tracks for others to find or gets comically dragged across the ground. (Because you see, their faces would get pretty bloody if the same thing happened to them on rock. Fortunately the terrain seems to have read the script and quickly adapts to accommodate the gag.) Too bad, because a bit more visual splendor and interest might have detracted from the schmaltzy, clichéd narrative."Up" can never decide if it wants to be drama (with female infertility, fatal illness, absent fathers, and an absurdly obese boy subsisting mainly on hot dogs, ice cream, and chocolate bars) or escapist fantasy, and somehow turns out to be neither.Many plot points are just ridiculous: Why didn't they just tie down the house to a rock next a bigger rock, to then climb onto the bigger rock and get back on the porch? Well, because three more jokes could be had if they didn't. How would a hundred-year old explorer be able to construct collars for dogs that read their thoughts, when in all other ways his airship is from the 1930s technologically? Well, because then you can have talking dogs. Aww, how cute. I bet the next Pixar film will have dancing hamsters and talking chipmunks. I can hardly wait...As with the house, my beef with the talking (and plane-piloting!) dogs is not that they talk, but that there is no reason for them to, except to "up" the film's cutesiness factor. "101 Dalmatians", "Dumbo", and "Aristocats" featured talking animals, but it was easy to accept there because it was necessary for the plots and the talking was not meant to be cute in itself.The score by Michael Giacchino, who seems to be everywhere these days, isn't bad, with a nice melancholy piano theme for the marriage flashbacks, but this can't save the movie any more than Horner's pretty decent score saved "Bicentennial Man".With "The Incredibles", "Walle", and "Up", Pixar seems have entered a downward spiral where its movies -- like most other summer blockbusters -- no longer merit multiple viewings because they are too idiotic, but at the same time not even a particularly good spectacle either. You can really only enjoy them once, and _only_ if you try very, very hard not to think about the plot at all. If this trend continues, it can't be long before Pixar drops to the "Shrek 3" quality level.If the new "Star Trek" movie was good dumb fun, "Up" is bad dumb fun, because the characters don't pull you in enough that you are willing to overlook the plot holes and the general lameness factor of the balloon house. Many children who watch this movie will probably catch onto that fact long before their parents do, who are still all teary-eyed from that oh-so-fabulous four-minute montage.These pretentious pseudo-artsy experiments like "Walle" and "Up" have to end before audiences suddenly wake up and discover that the latest Pixar movies actually suck, despite all the critical praise they get. Pixar's unique coupling between the Hollywood hype machine and Steve Jobs' reality distortion field only gets you so far. At this point, they should really return to talking toys/cars/rats. And with "Toy Story 3" coming out next year, it looks like they will do exactly that...
My feelings on this film seem to go against the vast majority of those on IMDb, but I really did not enjoy this movie. I thought the scenery was beautiful, sure, and that the story was at times touching, but none of the characters were strong or even all that appealing, and storyline tried way too hard to milk a childhood idea and lost steam quickly.From the beginning it is extremely sad, which would be okay had they not advertised it as a comedy. The comedic relief was lacking, with only one real funny character (Doug) who got annoying quickly. He redeems himself by becoming calmer and more loving, but his counterparts only wear out their welcome more.I'm having trouble wondering what Pixar was thinking in making the main characters a stubborn, old, depressed man and a dumb, fat child. Perhaps with the latter they were trying to make up for their social criticisms in Wall-E, but it was still a poor choice. I know that Mr. Frederickson had to be old and shows more emotion if he is stubborn and sad for over half the film, but it doesn't make him any more appealing. And if his wife meant so much to him and the story, why was she only in it for 5 minutes? Finally, to briefly touch on the antagonist, his motives were stupid and he should be way older than he was. He has a huge collection of beautiful things, yet is going after a multicolored ostrich. Look at his collection! Everything in there was way more spectacular than that bird that eludes him for so long! Moreover, considering his inventions its baffling to me that he couldn't take a picture or even do things that other characters do easily to find it.I was not at all satisfied with this film. The animation is great, and the story shows glimpses of true beauty, but it's target audience seems to be those well passed retirement. I think it was easily Pixar's weakest undertaking yet.
This, at least for me, was one of those movies where it gets really hyped up, but winds up not living up to the high standard I was told to expect. that being said: it is a cute movie, one that kids will enjoy, and has some excellent animation.The plot could have been better developed, and really, with the exception of Carl, all the characters are extremely static, the worst of all being the villain who gets all his development within the first five minutes of the movie. The time line of the movie is not even remotely realistic (yes, I know it's a cartoon, but a day to get to South America then three to walk 2 miles?) As of this writing: this movie is rated as being within the top 20 of all time, a honor it doesn't even come close to deserving. Yes it's got it's moments, yes your kids will like it, but don't go in expecting the next movie that people will be talking about for generations.


                
This little cartoon here settles for superficial caricature frames that it collects along the whole picture, like every theme and major point are a thick idea barely developed at all just hastily thrown in. It's incredibly formulaic.They establish how he's got this idol at the start of the film, and how his wife dies too soon and he loved her so dearly, and the little inside jokes they had between them (which is cheaply used as a recurring thing throughout the cartoon, like the obligatory repetition/emotional thing), and then there's the bad guy who's the irrational caricatured token bad guy, then the kid without parents just looking for love and companionship, then they threw in dogs because everybody loves dogs but they're not even all that funny (although some of it is okay-funny).It's way too rushed, and it's not touching at all and isn't very funny. It's mostly boring and just a little story to follow, nothing more.The two best things are the visuals and the sad main theme. Past that, it's mediocre-level.Failed cartoon, just a shell of what it means to be. Wayyyyy, way overrated.


                
After watching the movie, after hearing all the critical hosannas it received, I was quite a bit disappointed by the movie itself. The animation was gorgeous as usual and the images of the floating house were really memorable. What struck me was that none of the beauty of the film had gone into the creation of the story. It was frankly lazy and uninspired. WALL-E was an example of a film in which the plot and the characters were every bit as absorbing as the animation. The best part of this movie was the small, dialogue-free montage of Carl and Ellie's marriage. Very touching. But those few minutes could not compensate for an entire film that chose the easiest story options at every single opportunity. You could see every plot development coming from a mile away. Previous Pixar films did a great job in making even the most sappy, sentimental moments feel special. This movie failed to do that for me.


                
Maybe I came in with too high of expectations, but I know I'm not the only one who thinks that this movie wasn't so great. It was just OK. It had funny lines, -all of which were already shown in the previews-, and a pretty good plot, and great animation. But I just don't see why so many people think this is such an "awesome" movie. There was no adult humor at all, so maybe all the ratings are from parents or children, I don't know. I think the 3d version must be a whole different movie than the one I saw, because I walked out thinking it was just mediocre. Heres some advise, do Not watch it if it's not in 3D, you'll probably be disappointed as well.


                
I'm writing this primarily because of all of the reviews and comments that are playing down what is REALLY in this film with remarks like "the beginning is a little sad" or "it's PG because of some slightly intense chase scenes but it's nothing" - it's not fair to people who are doing their homework and trying to figure out if it's suitable for their young children. I've never before left anything close to a negative review about a Pixar movie. And even now this is not exactly negative, but it's truthful. I think they went a little too far with adult themes in this film, to the point that I will hesitate before rushing out to see another rated PG Pixar movie with my youngest child.*****SPOILERS BEGIN HERE*****The movie starts with the old man as a young boy. He meets a girl, they grow up, they get married. They aim to have children, they put a nursery together, and then - you see the wife sitting in a gynecologist office, and she is receiving news that she is infertile (some argue she had a miscarriage). She's crushed, and he promises her to fulfill their dream of going to South America, and they start a savings for this trip. Over the years, bad things happen, and each time they raid the trip fund. Carl finally realizes they are running out of time and buys the tickets in their old age. But Ellie ends up in the hospital and dies, never living her dream. Cut to now - Carl lives alone, and his home has become an island in a huge construction site. His view every day is dust and dirt, and construction workers and their vehicles. One day a vehicle bumps his mailbox and Carl bashes the worker who came to set it right in the head with his walker. Yes there is blood. He ends up in court, is declared a threat to society, and it is determined he will lose his home and be placed in a nursing home instead. By now I am thinking this isn't my idea of a good time, or a light afternoon with the kids. But I stayed, having faith it would turn around from there. The kid who ended up stowing away as Carl tried to escape his fate turns out to be a child of divorce who has been abandoned by his father. The two of them run into Carl and Ellie's childhood hero, and the hero turns out to be sadistic and deranged and the rest of the movie is spent with them being chased by this "hero" as he is trying to kill them. The one good dog Doug, spends the entire movie trying to get Carl to take to him. In spite of his harmless good nature, Doug is also targeted for abuse from Carl (much like the construction worker that was only trying to help). Carl growls at him to go away calling him a "bad dog" in a most cruel way, and kids cried as the dog slunk off with his tail between his legs. One little girl wailed But he's NOT a bad dog! He's a GOOD dog!! for ten minutes. The bird Carl and the boy were saving from the demented adventure guy is badly injured as she helps them escape, and she's a momma bird, and there are babies left (more abandonment) if Carl can't get them reunited. She ends up limping in a leg splint. The house itself is beat up, gutted, and almost burned down at one point, before it finally has to be sacrificed for the sake of saving everyone in the film. During the "happy" ending, you see the kid getting his promotion to senior scout, all the kids are standing there with dad, and he is there on stage alone. Granted Carl shows up to stand by the kid during this moment, but how many kids of divorced and absent parents do you think need this kick in the head to remind them of what they also don't have? Basically very little is left "safe" here - growing old, death, infertility, abandonment, broken promises, losing your home, court sentences, nursing homes, bad news from doctors, unfulfilled dreams, inability to get ahead, missing fathers, disillusionment, kids tied to chairs, birds with broken legs, babies left with no mother, mothers left without children. There are funny moments, and touching moments, but for me it wasn't enough to lift the heavy blanket of everything else that transpired. Of course, I had my little girl with me. I would look at her at times to see how she was taking the movie, and I'd see the bottom lip poking out, and she'd look up at me with those big soulful eyes, and suddenly I would want to wring the necks of the people who wrote certain plots of this film. But I never dreamed I would need to prescreen a movie from Pixar, and so I didn't, and this was where I went wrong. So in closing - how so many people are glossing over this stuff is beyond me. I've seen a few comments from people who feel like I do, so I know I'm not alone in my feelings that Pixar really went for the grown ups with this one. And plenty of adults are screaming about how much they like it, and I say of course they do, the film was written for them. But I think it came at too much of a cost in regards to the kids who have been cheated out of a movie that should have been geared more towards them. Someone speculated that maybe Pixar did it because wanted to be taken seriously- but as a result, I think they valued themselves more than they did the audience. And that's a sad thing to see.
Pixar, used to creating $200m hits were sure to slip one day and this is for sure it. I'm sure there will be a lot of investigations and soul- searching going on after this mess. The film's basic idea is pretty lame, and then the execution is even worse. There were certainly some promising moments in the film. The couple's cute life in silent mode, the almost cute dog with his squirrel distractions. But they were more than overshadowed by the distractions like the Bird ???, the super-explorer turned villain and the little kid.All in all quite a disaster, its like it was done by the Pixar trainees without one touch of supervision from the people who made the studio's mega blockbusters.As an aside, I'm not sure IMDb can do much, but the fake high ratings and fake great reviews for this movie are unprecedented. But when your a studio with x million dollars to invest in marketing, hiring 50 interns for 4 months to write comments for you makes a lot of sense. But of course, as with any useless movie on IMDb. Go to the first entered 4 pages of comments to see the *real* opinions.Don't be fooled, this movie is a disaster, and not your Finding Nemo or Wall-E.
In the past couple months I've seen Coraline, Aliens vs Monster and now UP. UP is the weakest of the 3. Balloons are beautiful and the scenery is great. And that about sums up the 3 D. The story? Yes Bambi and Lion King have the sad beginnings from which our "hero" emerges. Carl, however, is an old man who at the end defeats a guy who has to be 90+ years old. Dogs flying airplanes? Please. The talking collars are maybe believable but come on. The hero of Carl's youth kills people who come to "steal" his elusive quarry Kevin? Just one more "loss" for Carl and the much missed Ellie. Why does Russell remind me of Dash, check his mouth. Why does the black father at the end look like Ice or whatever his name was in The Incredibles? What happened to Russel's father? Why is Carl there at the end and "mom" is sitting in the audience? They needed Russel to be an orphan and they couldn't come up with a story line for it. The whole no child section is just too much at the beginning. If you are looking for a good cry about lost lives, lost loves, lost dreams and some ridiculous resolution when you throw away your cane and become an adventurer, here is your movie. Maybe they'll make a 3 D animate version of Sleepless in Seattle next?
I am so disappointed with this movie!! I was so excited to see it and I left the theater disappointed and sad. I know that most movies like this have obstacles characters need to overcome, but practically the entire movie was one negative and sad/bad situation after another. Way more trials and tribulations than funny moments. I went with the expectation the movie would have an overall positive and fun theme but it did not at all. It was a big downer. I can't imagine kids would leave this movie feeling all happy and cheerful as with most animated films. I will say that the animation/technical aspect was superb. Too bad the story wasn't as well.


                
My wife and I saw Up in 3D last night. Just us 2 adults, no kids. We have seen most of the animated features in recent years and liked most of them. I thought Up was decent, not great, but OK. My wife HATED it!I agree with pretty much everything *negative* that has been said on this board about the movie, but I haven't seen mentioned the thing that bothered my wife the most: there are NO female characters past the first few minutes! The only female (human) even in the movie is Elie, very briefly as a tomboyish child in the very beginning, then as an adult in a short, silent montage. So by 5 minutes in, it's all guys. I guess the bird was female, but that fact is so far from obvious that she gets named "Kevin" by the little boy. (Maybe some of the dogs were female too, but you couldn't tell.) I didn't even notice the lack of female energy until my wife pointed it out but it's true, and I think it contributes an overall imbalanced feel of the movie.As for the 3D, I thought the scenery was very nicely done, but the overall use of 3D was more subtle than many other 3D movies. I don't remember any "coming out at you" shots at all; most of the 3D images were at or behind the screen rather than in front of it. I think this may be why many have commented that they didn't even notice the 3D. Also there were too many "flat" scenes that might as well have not been in 3D, such as long closeups of items in a scrapbook and long segments of black and white old newsreel style footage on a TV screen.So I'll average my 7 opinion with my wife's 1 and say 4 out of 10.


                
The first 10 minutes are great and heartfelt, but the rest of the movie is just standard kiddie-animated-action-movie fare, but without any really funny gags or interesting or quirky characters. It seems for a lot of people the central premise/moral of the story touches a nerve, but that one idea alone isn't enough to lift the movie above an average rating.The animation is very good, as one has come to expect from Pixar, but sorry, the bar has been raised - in 2009 this level of quality has become the norm, i.e. average.The character development is good for Carl Fredricksen, but lacks depth for Russell and also for Charles Munts. Carl is really the only person in the movie who you kind of get attached to, but again, mainly due to the first 10 minutes montage of his life.The movie doesn't contain a lot of humour - the one it does have seems forced and silly (dog voice collars, the bird swallowing Carl's walking stick, etc. - yawn). This movie is nowhere near the league of Pixar greats ranging from Toy Story to Wall-E. For other studios this might be considered good, but for Pixar I would consider it average at best.


                
Carl (Asner) and Ellie meet, get married, can't have kids, she gets ill and dies. Carl blows up balloons to lift the house to Paradise Falls in South America, a place he and Ellie always wanted to go. This is a tear jerker, and really not for kids. The first 25 minutes will tear your heart out. This is a love story and you are reminded of that every step of the way all the way to the very end. Yes, Ellie dies, but the love lives on. Now, this is okay, but keep a box of Kleenex around. Maybe two. You like to see kids cry? What about seeing adults cry? Hmmmm<U+0085><U+0085>.. The promos have you believing this is a wonderful kids story. It's not. This is quasi adult story told via a cartoon. Cartoons appeal to kids. I rest my case. Okay, to be fair, maybe most kids won't notice the love story, the illness, the dying and that's fine, but this is not the Disney I came to know through the years. Not at all. The story continues and things happen and you forget about Ellie for about 2-minutes; then Carl, who always has Ellie on his mind, remembers something about her and there you are again reaching for the Kleenix. I must say it is astounding how fast we latch onto the deep love emotion and at every reminder of Ellie we are reaching for those pop-ups. We just don't like to see good people sad, even if they are cartoon characters. Later on in the story we meet Charles Muntz (Plummer) an Explorer type who is on the search for a bird no one believes exists. And, we have talking dogs. When Muntz mentions out loud that meeting Mr. Fredrickson (Carl) is a real treat the dogs go wild. This was a funny scene with Muntz saying he has to be careful about using that word. I'd say it was the funniest scene in the movie. The dogs do provide some humor at times. The voice of the dog, Alpha, was also supposed to provide some humor, but at times Alpha sounded like one of the Chipmunks and at other times, when Muntz adjusts the electronics in the collar, he sounded like<U+0085><U+0085>.well, I really don't know. With either voice he was very difficult to understand. So much for humor there. Oh, when Carl lifts the house UP into the air Russell (Nagai), a Cub Scout, looking to win a merit badge for helping elderly people, comes along too. I suppose he was supposed to be comic relief, (Carl is depicted as a grumpy old man), but the dogs win this hands down. Russell is used to move the story to places Carl doesn't want to go at times. Russell hopes his father, who he rarely sees, will finally make one of the Scout presentations. The father never shows. Where's that box? See?Why would I watch an animated cartoon again? Wall-e was a disaster, so why? I had to see what others saw in here that prompted it to be nominated for Best Picture. I now know these people are useless and crazy, and I will never watch another animated cartoon movie even if, by law, it is the one movie I must watch before I die. I'll go along with Animated Feature category, but not Best Picture. Best Picture? No, let's leave Best Picture to the humans, not animations. Give me a break. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.
Blockbuster animated films need to walk a line between being eye-catching and silly enough to be fun for kids, while being smart and deep enough to be rewarding for adults. Any violence should be, well, cartoonish. This film didn't balance between being a kid movie and an adult movie well at all.The animation was flawless. Ed Asner was perfectly cast and depicted. The silly stuff (Squirrel!) was there in painful overabundance. The film was eye-catching beyond description, especially in 3D. The story of the main character's loss of his dear wife, though, was gut-wrenchingly sad, and must have been utterly confusing to children. The fight scene where the too-evil explorer was shooting real bullets at a child with intent to kill him was far too violent and real for children. The villain's death was unnecessary.Since I won't be showing the film to a child, I looked at it from a purely adult perspective, and found too much childishly silly content to make it a good film for my tastes.
****THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** OK, so I know it was supposed to be a "kid's" movie, which is how most Disney/Pixar titles are advertised, I can't help but feel, after having taken my 3 1/2 y.o. to see it, that it had some pretty 'adult' themes that could have been better left out. And, before I'm besieged by folks saying "IT WAS RATED PG!", (of which I was totally aware), the film to me just seemed to have too many downers that supposed kid-friendly movies can do better or just without altogether.First, the death of the main character's spouse-complete with hospital stay? Just a little morbid to me. Fortunately, my little guy was enjoying movie snacks through most of that, so he didn't focus on it then, but he asked about her later when we got home. And I had to pull out my best explanation of it for a preschooler.Then, did anybody else think the 'talking' dogs were just weird? I found them creepy, and my son had a kind of 'head cocked to the side' look along with an ever-present hand on my arm whenever they showed up. Dogs in movies are supposed to be fun, so this one went way on the other side to me.And, to have them chasing the main characters, along with a very strange bird, and a formerly, high-spirited, but ultimately insane and homicidal adventurer/poacher, just kind of gave it all a bit of a pall to me.In Pixar's defense, they did add lots of colorful balloons, the requisite cute kid, a hopeful premise (letting go to truly connect), and a smiley ending.And, my little guy was ecstatic to tell his Grandma about the 'old Daddy' (Fredrickson), the little boy, and how the 'storm made the pictures fall off the wall'.So, I guess that's all that really matters!
what has happened to Disney and Pixar cartoons nowadays.think back to some of not only the best cartoons but some amazing films such As THE LION KING and TOY STORYthis film hardly compares to these films.the only cartoons really that should be in the top 250 are those Disney classics that were made before the millennium and maybe finding Nemo. i cannot understand how this film was so high,the only good part was the middle part. what was the abortion at the beginning this is meant to be a kids film, someone dying is okay but an abortion is far too deep.


                
They've really got the animation 'down', they are seasoned pros at it, and can do almost whatever they want. However, they've never seemed to work on getting skin and faces to look at all realistic. After all the work to make fur, feathers, water, clouds, fire, food, and almost everything else look like the real thing, it seems high time to make the human characters look like something other than play-dough. If they can get that down, there's a whole new world of human features and expression opened up. Just getting tired of looking at plasticine characters, it's time to move on from the "Toy Story" look. Even in 1988 Jessica Rabbit looked at least 2-D human, and 20+ years later Pixar could probably do something good if they tried.This movie -- started very slowly and boring, even as an adult I was asking, "What is this? What's this about?" well into it, and it didn't hold the kids' attention. The story is weird, and also simple.


                
Have you seen "Shrek"?You have? Oh good, that saves me a lot of time. "Up" is basically that.No? Well, fine. Alright, I guess I'll review it for real then."Up" is about a grumpy old widower who rigs his house up with a million billion helium balloons so he can fly it to South America and live in Paradise Falls, which is what he and his dead wife always wanted. On the way of his adventures he teams up with a goofy boy scout, a goofy talking dog, and a goofy tropical bird. He also meets up with his idol and fellow adventurer, who then sets out to try to kill him for "stealing his bird". Then the good guys win, the bad guys don't, and everyone has a happy ever after.Doesn't sound like Shrek? Allow me...Entire plot of movie = grumpy people + foils get put through some adventure the grumpy people don't want to do, but through doing it become generally happier people with metaphorically and physically more than what they started out with. In Shrek's case it was a princess. In Grumpy old man's case it was a big blimp and a team of talking dogs<U+0085>and the opportunity to see South America."Up" is by no means a bad movie...overall, it's a good movie in its own right, but a disappointment for me personally.This review was edited for length and content.

Technology is a wonderful thing. However, maybe we need to spend a little more time contemplating the subject matter of our "cartoons" rather than how cool we can make them look. To begin a child's movie with the revelation that death and heartbreak are inevitable is just plain stupid. This movie is a depressing look at real life that is, in my opinion, completely inappropriate for a child. I thought that, given time, the movie would accelerate to a more upbeat theme. No such luck. Throughout, you're reminded that this poor old man is alone. Old and alone are just not entertaining subjects, even if they're wrapped in bright colors.


                
This movie starts really strong. The back story is amazing and I wish it would have stopped there.
