seriously this thing is stupid. i just cant bring myself to believe that ANYONE would like this junk... its either that there's no plot or the plot is just a dragging line of nonsense made so that they could make more episodes. its this samurai who got sent into the future and then had to kill robot ants and stuff and in the end has to kill an "evil black guy" . every episode he kills some robot army whos "lazers" just wouldn't hit him. there's no real action either, just showing this guy's sword swinging and then a pile of dead "bleeding" robots(how do robots bleed???). its got nothing "samurai" about it... the graphic suckes too. "original", but sucks. well if ur a jerk u might at least enjoy laughing at how stupid this cartoon is...


                
I've heard that many people like "Samurai Jack". Honestly, I don't see anything really special about this cartoon.First of all, this cartoon has too many over-long scenes that seem to slow down the whole show (such as useless 10-15-second scenes of continuous water dripping, fire rising, etc.).Secondly, the way Jack goes into the past after each episode is never explained (Remember that each episode consists of Jack traveling into the past through many past time lines, in order to destroy Aku). Perhaps he has a sort of power to transport him through time, or maybe he finds a time machine at the end of each episode. I guess only hard-core fans would know.Finally, the sub-villains in the show are mostly robots. Robot & robots & more robots. It gets really tiring seeing the robots in almost every episode, especially since the robots themselves are not animated very well. They seem very simply drawn by the animators. Other sub-villains include certain monsters, but there aren't enough of them to make up for the dominant robot-villains.To conclude, this cartoon is a waste of time. It is yet another one of Cartoon Network's boring new cartoons. The only decent cartoon on Cartoon Network is "Ed, Edd, 'n' Eddy". Go watch that cartoon instead.I give this cartoon a 1/10.
This show was amazing! it was mature, meaningful and it had the best characterizing and humor!!
what were they thinking making season 5 that bad?
they just ruined it for all of us! I give the first 4 season 10 out of 10 but season 5 only 1!
it was NOT for adults immature bad story and all together awful and here is why:
-okay first of all adding some blood and swearing doesn't make a show for adults! you will need much more meaning.the first 4 seasons had meanings it taught me a lot and he was kind a sample for me.which btw they ruined it. :/
-Now let me start from the first episodes.the opening theme was really bad.jack telling himself gotta get back and all was just... bad
-the parts with his dark side were childish and most certainly not as good as the episode in the past seasons where he fought his dark side.
-and now Ashi, it was terrible! I realize you need some romance if you want to make it for adults but what was that?? 5 years old love?! in the first 4 seasons I always thought, well jack's hot. and when I heard last season is for adults I thought this will be so good. But spending time to introducing ashi made very little time for the classic actions. like the part when it showed him in his visions and meditate could be something meaningful but they showed ashi fighting so long there were just not enough time for any spiritual experience for jack!!
-now the eighth episode (s5) which supposed to be romantic was like OMG ARE THEY 11?? because that's not a 50 year old man (or even 20!) falls in love!!
Even the episode in the train with the woman who was trying to seduce him was hotter and more mature!
-AND THE ENDING???? they had the perfect story to work with.that portal which remained from the old seasons (with guardian who said he wasn't ready yet) that was going to be perfect to work with in the last episode! But this was just weak!
-and also they threw in some jokes like the poking thing which was old but ok.but in season 4 episode 7 where jack said "like totally cool" that was FUNNY!well I will be depressed for a few hours because it ended so weakly but I will still love it because of the first 4 seasons.And I hope people involved making season 5 read this so they higher their game a little, and I mean this the most respectful way possible.
