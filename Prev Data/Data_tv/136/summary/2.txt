 Children in big bodies

 Extremely Strong Start and from there in completely crashed down...

 Sadly, Sorkin resorts to his worst tendencies

 Sorkin fan deeply disappointed

 Crash and Burn

 Meh, corny humor abounds, ridiculous back and forth dialogue

 Stagey and unrealistic

 Transparent, insulting political partisanship

 Well written, but total fiction.

 It's filmed like a quality television

 I don't care about the politics, I do care about the horrible writing/acting/directing.

 Don't Get Hornswoggled Like I Did

 why America is not the greatest country in the world

 Good but not great from Sorkin
