 Contrived and Self-Indulgent

 The Emperor's new clothes?

 What's all the fuss

 Sick steroetypical attempt at humor

 Nonsense - irritating, dull, uninteresting, tiresome trash.

 A performance that'll make you cringe for it's surreal authenticity

 This is so BAD

 it must really appeal to the kind of people who subscribe to hbo, because it doesn't do anything for me.

 Awkward and lame.

 A rich guy can also have a bad day! We'll make a comedy out of that...
