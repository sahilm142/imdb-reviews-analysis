 I like this show, but probably not for the right reasons.

 Realistic and well executed, but I have mixed emotions on this one

 Great show but the plotlines can get tedious

 Really good, but far from perfect.

 Biker gang at war against everybody.

 Addictive but can let you down

 I loved it and hated it at times

 Impressive

 A great show that crashed and burned.

 Morphing into something less

 Season 7 should be the last

 A Good Start But Getting Predictable

 Great biker show

 Sons of anarchy

 A series with issues, but very enjoyable all the same

 Entertaining Show, But Not Award Worthy

 Motorcycle Gang Shakespeare

 Great until the end

 good story but bad cinematography , overwhelmed and miracle case solution's

 On the edge of greatness!

 Great show
