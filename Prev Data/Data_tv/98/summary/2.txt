 Dare Drivel

 Dull

 I feel like a Daredevil giving this review

 shitty plot with lots of crappy acting

 Wacthed the whole season, didn't like it - here's why...

 Boring...

 Good Idea, bad execution.

 Rubbish and then some more.....

 Worse than the 5.3 rated movie

 Dull and formulaic

 Disappointed, very disappointed!!

 Why Care Devil is more like it.

 pointless

 Massive disappointment

 This is written like a bad play

 Childish Yet Gruesome!

 C'est Terrinle. Really.

 Boring
