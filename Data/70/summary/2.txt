 Really Overlong and clichéd

 There's a lot of good reasons this movie bombed

 A fully restored disaster

 Horrible. It is the exact opposite of Godfather I and II and Goodfellas

 Stick with the westerns

 Over rated and SLOWWWW...

 Horrible, overrated, movie.

 There are only two worthwhile scenes in 4 hours of crap

 People Like This Film?

 almost good, but not really: too long, too dark, horrible score

 A Truly Awful Movie

 Too Long!!!!

 More garbage From Sergio Leone

 More Than Just A Movie!

 Not worth your time.

 Masterpiece it may be, but unnecessarily misogynist and long.

 Stunk

 Should be listed in worst movies ever

 terrible
