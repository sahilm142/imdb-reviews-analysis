 Solid entertainment in the second half of the movie, but not much more. Overall bland and flat, Mercury and all the Queen deserve much better.

 Fell short

 Excuse me, what?

 Shallow portrayal of an epic rock band

 Ironically formulaic

 Bad Attempt

 Awkward.

 Solid entertainment in the second half of the movie, but not much more. Overall bland and flat, Mercury and all the Queen deserve much better.

 Not that impressive

 Buy an album and save your time

 The critics are right, the story is neither mercury nor queens genius.

 Watching this movie was like drinking a stale, flat beer.

 it drags, leaps and skips..

 Cheesy and formulaic

 What a mess

 An Ordinary Story About an Extraordinary Band

 While the music is fun and Malek is good, the narrative is wildly inconsistent and builds up its characters horribly, making for one of the worst scripts of the year

 Outside the music, eye-rollingly bad

 Cliche film of a not-very-interesting band

 All show, no heart.

 What a disappointment

 Wikipedia-entry storytelling

 Fantastic Queen Music. Weak, bland TV movie quality film

 Cheesy, formulaic, and cliched. The music is good, but that's not really credited to the movie

 It's an average musical that tells a FICTIONAL version of Queen
