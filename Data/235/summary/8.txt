 The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com

 The Help is a very compelling drama about domestic life for women of color during the early '60s

 The opposite of my kind of movie. But a great movie I did enjoy

 A sense of win for colored in unethical situation.

 Made me touched

 What a great film 'The help' was...

 Which Skeeter is Better?

 Sensitive and entertaining like the novel and wonderfully acted

 Revenge never tasted so sweet

 A movie with a Heart!!!

 No summary

 Made for the galleries and entertain it does

 wonderful film with great performances

 You is kind. You is smart. You is important

 times to learn and not forget

 The Help is a must-see!

 Sad Reality
