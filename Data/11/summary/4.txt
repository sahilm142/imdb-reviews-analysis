 "it has some interesting elements"

 Overlong epic

 did I ruin the film?

 Much Better Books.

 Not a very good movie

 A Nice Story, But Not the Tolkien Classic

 Good Movie, Read the book first

 oh my

 Waste of time

 Don't let the hype catch you **spoilers**

 Not sure I saw the same movie as everyone else

 Huh???????

 Has Peter Jackson even read the book ?

 Brain operations take less then this

 Beautiful but empty (a little like Brad Pitt)

 Some Boring Movie!!!!!

 You can leave your long-sleeved t-shirt on

 If you've never read the book...

 Don't waste (a considerable amount) of your time...

 Don't believe the hype. 6 out of 10.

 A dreadful disappointment

 Did I see the same movie everyone else did...

 Why FotR is a moderately good fantasy movie but NOT (by a long shot) the movie of the century

 Sucked

 Boring 100% fantasy movie, nice scenery.
