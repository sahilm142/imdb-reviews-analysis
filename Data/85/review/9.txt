I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected "Dumb and Dumber" by the title. It wasn't that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been "The Legend of Rancho".Odd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak "Spanglish" here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.I will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one!


                
This is the very first time i write a review, mostly because I'm very lazy.However I just watched this film and i gotta admit it...I loved it!!!!At first i was like well "lets see what this movie has to offer"(btw its also the first Indian movie I've ever seen) and I was like okayits funny and then... like wow so thoughtful and reflexive!

"Whatever the problem in life is... just say to yourself 'Aal Izz Well'.. This wont solve your problems but it will give the courage to face it.." "Chase Excellence and success will follow".. " Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams".. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldn't get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest film to date.. The film's climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...To conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...My Rating: 9/10Thanks and Regards


                
I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.Haven't seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success – that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes : "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking." "Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart." Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You won't regret it.
Rajkumar Hirani... the name is enough to create an excitement in any cinema-fan alive. Munnabhai series have been awesome films, and his latest offering '3 Idiots' is another Masterstroke from this genius.I have no idea how 5-point-someone is, all I know is that '3 Idiots' is an amazing/awesome/inspiring film. A treat of a film! A film that is rich in emotions, A Film that leaves behind a great moral. The Youth are sure to worship this Film, and that will make this film a blockbuster. Cancel anything you're planning to do till the 31st, watch '3 Idiots', it's worth your time and money. Hirani and Joshi's script is simply superb. Through Humor how many rights and wrongs are said. I really loved the way Hirani showed us Sharman's family. A typical 1950's family, it's hilarious as well as genius. The film has Superb Performances: Aamir is fantastic as Funsok Wang Do. He's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels, he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good, yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet, his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head. He leaves you speechless in the scene when he awards Aamir The Pen. Mona is average.The Music is decent, with 'All Izz Well' being a complete chart-buster. The cinematography is perfect. All other departments are satisfactory.Watch this film right now...


                
this movie has a lot of things to tell us ..it shows us the extremely huge power of the mind and when the people are free,use their minds correctly and do what they really love as a job in their lives and not what the other people say to them,only then they success,and most of all they are happy and they can live every time of their lives..a movie with so much fun and suspense,with so great direction gives a so inspired result,and everyone will be full of emotions and optimism..i really thought that bollywood was some kind of parody,but without so much fun,without good direction and a lot of things like these..i am really sorry for that but i couldn't know..i thought that they were extemporaneous...fortunately,that movie made me wrong..it showed me that the films from east have so much fantasy and inspiration that i could never imagine..you have to see it!!


                
This movie hit on all cylinders. It was fun, funny, deep, intelligent, thought provoking, and seriously entertaining. It is not a dumb comedy, rather a very smart (and humorous) look at the struggles of engineering students in India.I thought I would have trouble with the subtitles, but after about 10- minutes I was completely 100% engrossed in the movie. The wife loved every bit of it.My single and only criticism is the length of the movie. I believe there were one or two too many situations which kind of caused the movie to drag.Otherwise I thoroughly loved it.Do not be fooled by the idiotic picture on the cover of this movie. And the first 5-minutes of the movie are not indicative of the brilliance of the rest of the film. It is not stupid humor (even though I like stupid humor).You will leave this movie being glad you watched it. Trust me.


                
There was an article published by Time magazine some years ago. It explained that while China enjoys a robust population and a rigorous educational system (for those who can afford it), the spontaneous and creative aspects of Chinese culture has been subverted. It's been marginalized so much so that American business specialists have been asked to speak at some of china's most prestigious companies to "teach" creativity. The article presumes that Chinese middle-managers have had so many concepts and facts drilled into them in school that they are unable to think outside of the box like Americans.Subtle racism and cold war paranoia aside, the article does have a point when it comes to the importance of academic memorization versus creativity. American public schools have been drawing and redrawing that line trying to find the right balance to mold the leaders of tomorrow with mixed results. Yet when I hear stories of a fifteen year old inventing a new groundbreaking cancer test, I can't help but feel a little prideful of being the partial product of American schooling.But while the Chinese seem to be stumbling, India has really stepped up, or at least the film 3 Idiots (2009) would have you believe it. Starring Aamir Khan as the amiable Rancho, the plot of 3 Idiots sounds like a Van Wilder (2002) rip-off. The brilliant but unorthodox Rancho causes mayhem and silliness at an uptight engineering university. His two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) join in the revelry to the dismay of the pig-headed dean known to the students as Virus (Boman Irani). But when Rancho takes interest in the dean's daughter played by Kareena Kapoor, the dean vows to have the 3 idiots expelled for good.Bollywood films are very good at taking seemingly trivial plots like the aforesaid and escalating them into gorgeous, high energy, thematically complex tales for which 3 Idiots is no exception. The movie encompasses a vastness of emotion and a breadth of themes which I do not dare expand on here for fear of ruining the movie. I will say that 3 Idiots does further validate my hypothesis that a major theme in modern Bollywood is upward mobility. While my familiarity with Indian film is limited, all the films I have seen made over the past twenty years involve a protagonist unhappy with his or her station in life and works their butt off to achieve better, often through creative means.I saw this theme in the repellently named Wedding Planners aka Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and the silly sci-fi comedy Joker (2012). Even the sappy love musicals of Yash Chopra like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) have characters who want to do better largely by questioning the conventions of traditional ways. 3 Idiots is an extension of that proud tradition only done with excellent comedy and some surprisingly depth along with some catchy musical numbers.Stop to consider today's modern American films in comparison. Sure there are classic hero journeys in movie theaters but few have unadulterated happy endings quite like Bollywood. Many settle for the moral of "do what you can," or "you can be happy with your lot in life so long as you have someone to love". And let's not forget the common contemporary comedy message "have fun and worry about the consequences later." These messages make sense in the economic malaise of the day and the superhero genre has replaced the musical comedy as far as being a glitzy distraction for the masses. Still the superhero films as well as the Oscar-bait of the last few years don't have the subversive themes of their Indian counterparts. Nor to they have the energy! The energy in 3 Idiots is so incredibly infectious, if you're not smiling in the first five minutes you might need defibrillation. Seriously call a doctor, you're legally dead.Those who are worried about China's looming domination of Asia and eventual world power status need not worry about it. If I were worried about any country flexing its muscle it'd be India. It's a polyglot, multicultural nation with English its language of commerce. It's got a huge, pro-democratic population and has the creative juices to pull off long-term economic and cultural growth. But don't lose any sleep over the decline of the American Empire, at least our overlords will be benevolent or at the very least hilarious.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com


                
Perfect. Almost. Oh yeah... those are the words! I'm writing this at the 8th hour of the morning of 25th December. Merry Christmas, viewers, this is the perfect treat. I was lucky enough to have caught a special preview of the year's best movie, 3 Idiots, last night. Aamir Khan fans, after a disastrous Ghajini, prepare to be truly delighted! He once again shows his 'perfectionist' attitude with this highly-anticipated soon-to-be blockbuster! It has EVERYTHING - from good humour, to emotions that actually move you. When a sense of fear is supposed to be created, it is created, and when you're supposed to feel good, you do! Remarkable performances by each and every one of the characters just adds to the entire effect. A nice-to-listen-to soundtrack assures you that even the song sequences aren't boring. And over that, such beautiful choreography! Witty dialogues and hilarious one-liners keep you wanting for more, and some head-bobbing suspense makes you wonder as well...But, above all, above EVERYTHING else, what truly, TRULY makes this movie work is Rajkumar Hirani's brilliant sense of direction. How he cuts between the past and the present, at the perfect moments, is just amazing. With this, he could finally emerge as one of the leading directors of the country today.3 Idiots is based on the book Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, even though it's hugely different. And, for the first time in my life, I can proudly say that yes, finally, a movie has not just done justice to the book, but easily surpassed it. All thanks to Rajkumar Hirani. And proudly too because an Indian did it! I have to be strict... it's an Aamir Khan movie. So I have no option but to cut off 1 for the editing and dubbing errors.9/10. What more do you want? Don't miss it for anything!


                
The very fact that the education system in my country (and perhaps in a lot of developing countries) SUCKS and as a student, I am seriously suffering from it, makes this movie worth watching. It gives me a little hope, a little faith, that success and happiness will eventually come to those who pursue excellence in stead of just focusing on their grades, their qualifications. I guess that many Western people cannot understand what Asian students like me are going through. We have to study all day, I mean, studying is not only a 7 to 5 "job" but it also deprive us of our sleep. The working environment is so damn competitive, our parents are like 'get straight A's or you will have nothing to eat' and the stress is unbearable. So, if you are having to deal with all these, give this movie a try! Good laughs, great messages, enjoyable story.


                
I loved this movie, it was a very smart and enjoyable movie despite the length. I loved the characters specially Rancho, Pro Virus and Silencer. I am not a fan of music in movies but I loved the music in this movie. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the name: 3 idiots is not appropriate, it should have been "Looking for Rancho" or "Al-its-wel". Another thing was It doesn't explain much about why Rancho ran away from his friends and his love, it never explains why he couldn't express his love. You can sort of figure it out at the end of the movie, but is not that clear. Well despite all this it shows Hollywood that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time, and a college movie doesn't have to be about stupid humor, booze, bombshells and boobies.
Great movie, is my first time i watched a Bollywood movie and i was very satisfied!!Very good acting from all... That film was the first in my life that could change my emotions from one scene to other! You can laugh and cry at the same time. I 've never got bored during the movie, instead of that i was begging not to end and to have more and more story. The dialogs were very smart with a good sense of humor.It can teach you many things!Enjoy it!!


                
I have to admit, I didn't expect much. I tend to shy away from foreign movies and the title didn't seem very intriguing either. The trailer looked silly and I didn't really have a reason to watch this other than the fact that it was highly rated. But man was I wrong about this movie. When I decided to start watching it, I had little to no patience and was looking for the first reason to just stop watching it. As the movie progressed, I couldn't stop watching it! It sucked me into a world of comedy, romance, and drama in a way I've never seen used before. It was so unique in the way it was used; it wasn't a typical Hollywood film with every cliché scene being used. I quickly found myself become attached to these "3 idiots" through great acting and character development. This movie was stuffed with life lessons and ultimately very enlightening. It was all a slam dunk. a 10 out of 10. However, don't get me wrong. This movie wasn't perfect. There was a few scenes where they would break out into song for about 10 minutes which was a little annoying but I could see how it fit into the movie. I just sorta thought it was a bit childish and a little abrupt. But all in all, a very well developed movie. I highly recommend this.


                
May I add to that, potentially life-changing!I would rate this movie somewhere between 9 and 10 , I wasn't sure which grade to give it, but 10 seems more appropriate.This movie actually , has many flaws. And I know I often watch a movie then rate it with a 5/10 , then rumble about it's flaws.. But, sometimes there is just something that you "love" and in it the flaws are minimized and overlooked. So it is with this movie for me. I love love love how inspiring it is. And how it can bring the emotions out of you. Make you connect and feel with the characters! This is simply amazing! Not many movies can do that. There are 2 or 3 scenes that I adore, and then there are others, flawed and all.. but still this movie is just special. A must watch. It starts a bit slow.. but you have to be patient. First half is good, second half is awesome! The cast in this movie is perfect! Amir, his friends, the teacher , the girl. Just perfect. And really the girl was an important role to cast and she is such a good choice! Looks wise at first you would think hmmm maybe not so much; but that girl has a spark that you will not find. I saw her in one other movie and so I knew what she could do, and surely as movie rolls along , she adds her sparkly personality and lifts the movie a notch higher. Aamir Khan has become my favorite Indian actor, and is perfect in this, and the professor is also such a good choice! Just wow! Why do I go on and on about the cast, because this cast made the movie what it is. It's not about how well you act, it's how well a role you are put into based on who you are. A super good movie! Different from Hollywood, very refreshing!Real rating: 9.35
Im not a Hindi movie fan, in fact, this is my first time to watch Hindi movie. But this film is totally blowing my mind! Great story, good script writing, best performance of Aamir and also others actors / actress too. 2 Thumbs up for 3 Idiots! Its not simply just a comedy, but with something to think about for our own, and also bring along with touching moment! The positive message from this film will definitely hit the viewers. It shows how most of people are react at this present moment. Like, do we really do what we love and love what we are doing? If there's a fear, do we really take the risk and overcome it? If there's an opportunity, do we see it and hesitate about it? Well, sometimes the results is not that important, the process is the most concern and 3 idiots really taught us we should appreciate the relationship with parents, friends, the one we love & care! The cinematography is good, the songs & music are nice too! Rajkumar Hirani is brilliant director and script writer! Salute. Rajkumar Hirani is brilliant director and script writer! Salute.


                
The first time I watched this film it was a great surprise, because I've never liked Bollywood films and I didn't know what to expect. A friend of mine told me that it was her favorite film and that I should watch it..I'm glad that I've listened to her.This marvelous film is so good that you don't even notice the long duration of it. It has a little bit of everything and even the few musical parts of the movie fits perfectly.Directed with a perfect rhythm, this movie rebels against the actual educational system in which the more important is to pass tests but not really achieving new skills than really learns something that is going to be useful.Rancho, the main character of the film, is introduced to the audience as an idealist who defies the system not caring about the consequences, his one and only concern is study hard for learning and achieve new skills. An amazing character that should inspire who watches the film.Definitely this movie is not what it looks at first sight, it is a great, unforgettable and inspirational film that gets into the bottom of the heart.


                
this is film is the most funnest i have ever watched Cos it made me laugh all the way though the film.. it was so many funny moment that you will laugh u head of just like me.. but i don't like the head teacher cos he is really nasty and horrible Cos of him one of the student killed him self and to be honest i would give him a slap Cos he is really horrible to everyone including his daughters,i also cried when that student died cos poor him he worked really hard for his family and then all went to waste as killed him self. although this movie had some sad movement it also contains most of the funnest bits ever! i would say to people u should watch this film.. as its really funny and amazing.
I first watched this movie while on vacation, staying at my aunt and uncle's house. As this was the movie they chose to watch one night, I was preparing to drag myself to endure a painfully long, three-hour drama. However, I've found it to be very engaging and entertaining.In this film, Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi want to re-unite with college friend Rancho and recounted their college days at New Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, recalling the memories of Rancho, who inspired them to think differently, their run-ins with the fiery college dean Viru Sahastrabudhe and their encounters with another student, Chatur Ramalingam, who reminds them of a bet they had made 10 years ago.This is the first and only Bollywood movie I have seen and while I am not a big fan of drama, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi wrote a very inspiring story for the film that kept me entertained, covering friendship, sacrifices, relationships, antics, secrets, rivalries and struggles in the movie. Hirani took good care making each scene of the movie captivating and intriguing while directing, keeping the plot's momentum going strong even for a three-hour movie, and assembled a likable cast of characters - each delivering solid performances.I enjoyed watching the antics and misadventures the three friends go through during their college days, fumbling through exam notes and cramming in science projects, striving to reach success. Rancho's little romantic relationship with Pia is also a treat to watch, ***minor spoiler ahead*** especially when, unbeknown-st to Rancho, that she is the daughter of the dean. ***minor spoiler ends*** The songs sung in the film is wonderful to listen to - very catchy and fun - and the cinematography is very vibrant and colorful.Overall, it is a very captivating and heartfelt film from start to finish, sure to bring you laughter and tears. You can't help but follow along and pretend you are there with the three friends' journey in life. A highly recommended movie! Grade A
Yes - it is a bit long. Yes - It is a bit unbelievable. Yes - it has old jokes. But the point is, it is a movie, not a documentary on global warming where the facts are supposed to be facts (really?) What I liked? The pace of the movie (assuming you remove some scenes like that baby delivery or bride kidnapping). The jokes are effective because they are well executed, acted, and the timing is just right. So are the melodramatic scenes. The acting is fine. Was impressed by Sharman Joshi. Aamir Khan (a bit old for the role) has always delivered. Omi has portrayed his character well.A few points. The plane scene is not a realistic one (then neither is Rambo or Air Force One). And, in this day and age, how can you not locate a rich guy who is making half a million dollar a month in small town India! The whole inverter idea with the baby delivery scene! Wow! The climax was a feel-gooder, but not appropriate as the message got lost. Boman Irani should have been a part of the climax and should have learned his lesson then.Oh, well. It is just a movie. When you compare it to other Holly and Bolly movies (which have similar flaws), this one does stand out as a good entertainer. Definitely worth seeing, I would say..
An ordinary school story? Absolutely not. 3 Idiots ,in my opinion,the most exciting and different school-themed film of all-time. Because it is not just make laugh you ,movie also give lessons to you like friendship, love that sort of things.The story of the film (in my opinion) is very gripping. And the cast is perfect.I'm not familiar with Indian Films but the cast is really impress me.And the actors ,effects ,musics was perfect.The film also likes a musical.The plot of the film is very exciting .Two friends ,Farhan and Raju searches their long-lost friend Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chancad. When the film is move on ,you see the real life of students ,pressure ,stress ,even suicide of a student, exams. Just work for good grades ,not for the knowledge ,etc.. Farhan tells the story in the film .When you look back in the time ,everything in the film is familiar to you.I guaranteed this to you.In the film you laugh ,maybe you cry ,but you like it.I recommend this film to everyone.Don't listen anyone's comments, just watch the film and enjoy.My Vote: 9/10
I love Chetan Bhagat's novels. I work with many engineers who immigrated to the US from India. Bhagat's novels (especially "2 States") help me appreciate the land they came from, that schooled them, and is still attached to their souls.Both "Five Point Someone" and "3 Idiots" tell about students suffering through college and the transformation to adulthood. Both stories are engaging, cleverly constructed and funny as hell, but they show different things, at a different pace. Novels show internal transformation, while movies show the transformation of relationships. Neither story is biographical. Neither story depicts "reality". Both stories work as fiction and frivolous entertainment. Both are respectful of their characters.If you want great art, read Tolstoy. To learn How Things Work, read Darwin. If you like the Marx Brothers, and you want to laugh your ass off, watch "3 Idiots". This is not a movie to make you think (Of COURSE universities in developing countries are lethally competitive) but to bombard you with the unexpected. Which for this westerner included the jarring Bollywood "let's stop the plot and dance", though in this case it is "let's use dance to fire-hose a different set of sight gags at the viewers". One part of your laughing brain can rest while another takes over. This movie will definitely engage all your humor muscles, including engineer and college nostalgia humor muscles if you have them. If you enjoy "funny machines", there are plenty of those, too.Some parts were beyond me - Silencer's idiosyncratic Hindi becomes mere word-substitution jokes in subtitle, and I'm left to imagine how his non-standard pronunciation and mannerisms are 2/3 of the humor Still, even Silencer and Virus were treated with respect - all the characters were victims of a situation created by colonialism, poverty, desperation, and ambition displacing love. You can cry or you can laugh - choose your movies accordingly. If you want to cry about abused students, watch "Dark Matter" (2007). If you don't like fart jokes, don't watch this movie, or read Benjamin Franklin, either.India turns out a lot of films. I'm sure all the elements of this movie are borrowed from others, and if you've watched a thousand movies you won't see much new stuff here. Good artists plagiarize, great artists steal, and these artists robbed the entire film vault. They pasted their swag together pretty well, and in some surprising (to me) ways.IMHO, a 170 minute movie is too long, which is why I give it a 9. But if they edited it down to 90 minutes, and kept all the best humor, I might have died laughing. It was never plodding, though it slowed from manic to almost sane in places.I'm buying 4 copies for Christmas presents - I have some godchildren that need their humor centers stretched. This ought to do it.


                
First he taught us that laughter is the best medicine. With his second venture, he taught us the ways of piece and love through Ghandism. Now, with 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani tells us to chase excellence and success will follow.I'm a viewer who believes the best way to send a message is through an entertaining way rather than a preachy way. A message through entertainment hits you harder than a boring and preachy one. Films, of course, are not meant to send messages, but it's always nice to see one that does. I honestly believe nobody can do it better than Raju Hirani - Currently the best director of Hindi Cinema.Like his previous attempts, Raju Hirani makes us laugh, cry and think all in one viewing. 3 Idiots not only introduces you to a new world, but also provides a fresh way of filmmaking and narration. Not to forget that it tackles an issue that not many have touched upon - The Education System.Years after graduating from college, Farhan and Raju receive a message from an old classmate, Chatur. Chatur claims that he has found their old buddy Rancho. Rancho, a free mind, an intelligent student, a good guy. Why is Rancho so important? What exactly did Rancho do? Why did he leave? Will Farhan and Raju find him? All that is depicted in the next nearly 3 hours of the movie.To start, 3 Idiots deals with a few things here and there. Whether it is the poor school system that discriminates and pressures you involving your grades. Whether it's you father forcing you to become an engineer and not allowing you to pursue your dreams. Or even a bright student who fears he may not be able to live up to the high expectations. Finally, 3 Ididots says one simple thing - Chase your dreams, demolish your fears and try your best - Success is a given.There are a number of significant moments I totally love in the movie. Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed. Of Course, who can forget Chatur's hilarious "Balatkaar speech" Just Genius writing. There are more moments to cherish here. The whole climax is lovely. Mona Singh's baby delivery is gripping. Finally, Rancho's real identify being shown keeps you glued and enlightened all at once.My favorite part of the film is when Farhan and Raju decide their fates. Farhan confronting his father about his real dreams and Raju's interview - Just amazing moments.Flaws? I really don't see any. I do want to note that the film is almost 3 hours yet you do not feel like it has been that long.Rajkumar Hirani and his co writer really developed a nearly flawless script here. The lines are just amazing. They are fresh and also have that feel-goodness to them. The screenplay is excellent.The music of the movie grows on you. All Izz Well lifts your spirit. Give Me Some Sunshine is amazing. Behti Hawa is also an underrated song. Songs are pictured well.R. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. He's got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. He's just first rate. Especially in the scene when he goes to give his interview.Kareena Kapoor is actually acting well here. A great act. Boman Irani is first rate as always. He's just brilliant. His character is sort of similar to his earlier character in Raju Hirani's first film, Munnabhai MBBS. However, there's a huge distinction in Boman's act. Shows the man's versatility.Aamir Khan holds 3 Idiots together all through. I feel he should have gotten the best actor award that year instead of Amitabh Bachchan in Paa (That was a great act too) He looks the role, he's just perfect in every frame. You don't really expect anything less than that from Mr. Khan.All said and done, even Aamir would agree with me that the real hero of this film is Raj Kumar Hirani, the director. He's filled the movie with so many wonderful moments, extracted some memorable performances and has given one of the most entertaining films to Indian Cinema.What else can I say? Just a big thanks to director Raj Kumar Hirani, producer Vinod Chopra and actor Aamir Khan for giving us this modern day classic.In Munnabhi MBBS - It was a "jadho ki jhappi" In Lage Raho Munnabhai - It was "Get well soon, mamu" And now, it's - ALL IZZ WELL!


                
There are many people who find nothing useful in real working life which have been taught and studied with great pressure during their student life. There are many instances where students have taken last step as suicide when they can't handle the study pressure. There are people who have inner abilities and skill sets of some other field than the field in which they are currently working or say there are people who trying hard to establish themselves in the field according to their chosen career path but can not make the headway. Actually these kind of people might have realised that they have taken wrong path and that is because of parent's expectation, social status or may be because of peer pressure. There are people who are repenting after making career in the field in which they are not enjoying and have mindset that they would have been done better in some other field. There are parents with the mindset that some educational field are good and some are bad. This is may be because of status in the society, job market and money reward in the field. But by this way they are ignoring inner abilities of their child and take the part in spoiling their career. This is like curing the disease the wrong way by giving wrong drug. This way they are killing their real pleasure. There are girls and guys who repenting after getting married to a person who is so materialistic who running behind only money and has no value for human feelings. Finally this kind of marriage wont last longer and results in the divorce. The film is giving good message to all of above people with humour. Songs are also good and well placed in the movie.Over all it is another very good movie of Aamir khan.


                
As someone who has never seen a Bollywood film, and doesn't care much for them, I was skeptical about 3 Idiots. But, I had heard good things and decided to give it a shot. Luckily for me, it is a very enjoyable film. At times laugh out loud funny, at others deadly serious, it's one of those rare films that doesn't break the mold, but still manages to be fantastic.The film is primarily about three students who attend the prestigious ICE engineering school. One student, Rancho, quickly makes a name for himself as the student who walks the other way and makes enemies of the schools head, Virus as he tries to enlighten his fellow students Raju and Farhan. While not familiar with Bollywood films, I am familiar with the genres staples, and they are here, including musical numbers, lots of melodrama, and lots of crying. Yes, there is cheese here, but it's a well done film. The characters are enjoyable and the story is wonderfully told. Behind it are issues that, while laid in an after school special kind of way, are very serious. Suicide is even covered here, and it is not handled in a comedic fashion. These issues are taken very seriously and it is the heart of the film. The acting is mostly responsible here for the success of this film, relying on the combined goofiness and drama of the three primaries. I can't say that the film isn't predictable, though there are several shocking moments. But, even with it's predictability, the cast is so charming that it's just something you can sit back and enjoy. I suppose I wasn't expecting much going in, and at a running time of almost 3 hrs. (something very a-typical for this kind of film), you might think you'd get worn down. But this is a very enjoyable film. Yes, it goes to some very silly places and even seems awkward at times, but by the end, you can't help but smile. Can say I am honestly pleased I took the journey.


                
I really loved this movie. When you don't understand the logic why people around you stress the importance of studies, then probably the best motivational movie around to watch is '3 idiots'. Aamir (Rancho) showed how dedication and hard work in studies can take you to the heights of success. The movie proved yet again that Aamir is one of the best and creative minds in bollywood. One of the rare movies that keep your guessing and maintains the suspense right through the end.The movie is a whole package, its about true friendship and love. A must watch movie. Totally worth watching movie, you wont regret watching it even if you will have to watch it with subtitles.
