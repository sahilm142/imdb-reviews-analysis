 Surprisingly incoherent and boring

 Hmm, the most overrated junk movie, I have seen in my whole life

 Very disappointing and a step backward for Batman

 A Major Disappointment

 Contrived aimless plot full of philosophizing worthy of a grade-schooler

 Who needs 2 and a half hour superhero movies?

 Some action movie -featuring Batman

 I'll tell you why so serious

 A disaster on SO many levels

 Bored of loving Batmans movies!

 The dehumanizing product of a morally stunted culture

 Great start, but then it gets ruined

 A Matter of Perspective

 This city deserves a better class of movies...

 Why so serious, indeed?

 Weird, sadistic, no redeeming value, really

 Action Aplenty.

 For Action Film Fans Only

 The Dark Knight-mare

 A Different Perspective

 Really, really disappointing, and way too long.

 Laughable - Batman trying to be an art-house movie!

 Overrated, Over-Hyped Disappointment

 Dear Mister Nolan, and co,

 this movie contains all the clichés and failures of today's blockbusters
