I had heard raving reviews for this show calling it a 'masterpiece' a 'new beginning to anime' and as I'm a fan of anime, i thought i would go into this show with an open mind, and to not judge too quick. After the first 15 or so episodes, i was impressed.As a long time fan of Death note, i've always found animes such a Avatar the last air bender to be childish and lame. And thats exactly what i got. This show is nothing more than a kids show with boring characters, boring story and a confusing yet interesting background. This show wasn't that bad its just not for people who think every anime is timeless.4/10
