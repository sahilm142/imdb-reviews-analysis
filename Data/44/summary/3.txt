 Pay no attention to this review, because almost everybody loves this movie.

 Hollywood hogwash with good technique

 Jazz fiction

 Appalled at all of the Spectacular reviews.

 Unrealistic

 Grotesque, stupid sado-masochistic fiction, indulging bad taste and low inclinations of its viewers

 It's got no soul

 When did drumming become a BloodSport?

 Finishes on a high 'note', but it's heavily flawed and almost intolerable to sit through for the most part

 Fake, fake, fake

 Terence Fletcher: I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that's an absolute necessity.

 A disturbing glorification of sadism and masochism using excellence as an excuse.

 Don't waste your time

 What are you... there's no fn Mars Bar down there, what are you looking at? Look up here, look at me.

 What's the point of this film and why do people like it so much?

 Where's the swing?

 Maybe I don't get it

 House of Whipcord is probably better

 Solid flick
