 What has happened?

 Slowly in decline

 They have ruined a good show

 It got too repetitive

 criticism about last seasons

 Bitter disappointment

 A Great New Show

 Has some moments of brilliance

 Love the show but HATE CAM - the guy is toxic

 Doesn't live up to the Hype

 Good show!

 Good humor, too many stereotypes

 Season 1!

 It's okay, just not great.

 Gets boring and annoying

 A Great Achievement in Comedy

 Easy entertainment worth watching.
