 "You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you knew what you had you patented it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox"

 Not even close to the source material that was the novel

 A lot to endure to see dinosaurs

 Jurassic failure as Frankenstein ripoff and Harryhausen homage

 What a waste of a good starting premise.

 T- Rex & Laura's Legs

 Cretaceous Park
