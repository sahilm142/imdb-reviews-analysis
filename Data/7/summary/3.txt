 Sweet dreams, everyone.

 Shocked by disappointment

 Can I just say 'ouch'?

 A Fool's Hope

 This SHOULD have been the greatest movie ever...

 They read a different book...

 Just too LONG!!!!

 too many close-ups

 LOTR III - A great unfinished work

 Seen it All Before..

 A huge disappointment (spoiler)

 bed-time watching...

 Boring!!!!!

 Mindless Dribble

 The story is just a little too silly to carry the emotional weight of a masterpiece.

 overlong and over-hyped to the max

 Almost follows the star wars trilogy: two winners and a dog to finish

 A poor adaptation

 Unbelievable

 Overrated

 Down hill

 I don't get it...

 Way Overboard

 ...hmmm

 3 hours and 21 minutes...seemed like twice that
