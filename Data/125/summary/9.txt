 The examined life...

 Never is too Late to Live, Watch the Sunset and Plant a Seed of Love

 An incredibly well-written and acted story about the meaning of life

 Best of Akira Kurosawa

 "Life is brief ..."

 A Thought-Provoking, Powerfully Moving & Deeply Introspective Study Of Life, Death & Human Nature

 A truly amazing story. (Spoiler warning hereby given!)

 A movie you MUST see!

 An extraordinary film about an ordinary man

 Profound and universal

 The sort of movie that improves with age

 To live.

 The Older You Get, the More It Means

 Live the Cosmic Wow Right Now

 Old and alone

 How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death.

 Masterful!

 To Live, to really live

 Kurosawa, the humanist !!!

 Masterpiece Movie

 Life is Brief; Fall in Love, Maidens!

 Moving, unsentimental masterpiece

 Way Way Way different than any Kurosawa movie I have seen

 To Live

 Realistic Humanism
