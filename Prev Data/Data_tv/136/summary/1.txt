 OK, I started off loving this show

 Terrible execution of a good concept

 Unbelievably Bad

 Getting old fast

 I wish I liked it

 A new West Wing it is not

 Good a concept - shameful execution.

 A great promising start, that goes all the way down.

 This surely is not a Sorkin Screenplay

 Left wing propaganda

 Readjusted Rating -- Again

 Pathetic

 Edutainment that might have worked in another century

 IMDb has been compromised!!

 Wow

 Good show but unwatchable for me

 Propaganda disguised as drama

 I hate this show

 Smug, superficial, pretentious

 Taking awfulness to the next level!

 I absolutely loathe Aaron Sorkin....

 Wateertown is so easy to say

 It's ok

 One big liberal, DNC infomercial.
