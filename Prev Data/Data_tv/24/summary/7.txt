 Series 1 & 2 are great.

 Simply pointless

 I wish Season 3 was not made.

 Dark crime comedy series with first rate acting , magnificent setting and interesting intrigue

 Good,.but kinda overrated..

 Season 1: Brilliant; Season 2: OK, I guess; Season 3: Crap.

 Watch the first season, maybe the second and avoid the third

 Sociopaths Never Sleep

 Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper

 Heavy handed, but fun.

 Good show pity about the end

 Okay. It's A Good Show. But Is Nothing Sacred?

 Decrease performance

 But its not true.

 Season 1

 Did this really happen?

 oh yeah you betcha

 A little slow, but worth watching.

 Fargo Season 2
