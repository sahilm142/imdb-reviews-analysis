 Started well and suffered a lengthy decline in quality.

 A family of uneducated liberal

 This has none of the 'class' of the original

 Too much vulgarity, too little sense

 Please make it stop!

 Just...why?

 It's a hood-rat Cinderella story

 i'll give it a "T" For trying

 The original is so much better

 Another "light" version of a great British show
