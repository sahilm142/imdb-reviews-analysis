In Turkey I was suffocating from drama,"history" and silly comedy series, but this TV series is something so ahead of these kinds. First of all this is the first one which was made on an internet based platform, like Netflix, which name is Blutv and this is the biggest advantage for the project. If it was on TV, there would be lots of censorship. Cast is could be one of the best in Turkey, even some of them played in international projects. And the intro music has a special place for me because of the person who sang it (Selda Bagcan). To sum up, projects which liked so much and was made in Turkey can't pass the numbers of two hand and Masum/Innocent is definitely one of them.


                
I really get excited after than seeing all the names of cast - but really cannot expect that much powerful product from a newcomer internet television, BluTV. They really made amazing job by taking all these people together with an awesome scenario. It has balanced suspense and horror and flow of scenario is really lucrative. Hope to watch more than one season but these 8 series were really engaging!


                
This series truly demonstrates what great writing and acting can achieve, anything else beyond that is just ornamental. Stunning performances by the actors, truly believable emotions, weaving through a complex plot. Even though you'll watch this with the subtitles on and you'll be alien to a few of cultural references, the true human feeling of the story is unchanged.
