Sure the project is honorable and courageous to kick dictators and alert about the oppressed but a movie is not a political work but an artistic one: honestly i tried to watch it but after 20 minutes of unfunny jokes, heavy pantomimes and silly grimaces, i had enough... The production looks cheap or the sets are really badly build, the scenes are tedious, endless, ... so that's really not my kind of fun and it's really discourages me of watching any Charlot movie after that! For the same subject, prefer the comics Maus!


                
It is supposed to be such a great movie, but I didn't like it. There is no humour that appeals, it is all too weak. The only good thing about it was the speech the jewish barber made in the end.
