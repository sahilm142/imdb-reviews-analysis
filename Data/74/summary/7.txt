 Up Scotland

 Baggy Pipes

 An Enjoyable Film, But Winner of Five Oscars... Really?

 A decent enough film but a historical joke

 good movie, but it panders to Scots-Irish socio-politics of America

 Villains rule over a country could not interest me in the least

 Not really English

 Historically Inaccurate

 Amazing

 great movie

 A bit overrated & it doesn't age well

 Woad is me!!!

 How Gauling to be a Celt

 History as seen with an american mindset

 Loved it better the first time around.

 One of the best films ever made

 A film about a man who tried to give Scotland their FREEEEDOMMMMMMMMM!

 I appreciate it !

 don't believe all the details !

 Not Perfect, But Still Good Cinema

 Not a must-see, but certainly an impressive cinematic work.

 Very Well Made But Historically Inaccurate Film...

 Fact or fiction

 Pretty but pretentious

 An excellent movie, but a bit of a fairy tale
