 One of the best men who ever lived

 There will never be another Mr. Rogers

 Someone who talks to kids respectfully

 The most sincere thing on television possible

 Mr. Rodgers grew on me

 The best children's television show ever made!!

 Learn lots.

 The Ultimate Calming Presence

 Special Thanx to: Chef Brockett, Lady Elaine and Mr. McFeeley

 Miss You Mr Rodgers Ten Years Later!

 I Hope, REALLY Hope, they never stop showing Mister Rogers!

 Nothing but the best

 Inspiring Man-he was the real deal!!

 This show was my freakin childhood!!
