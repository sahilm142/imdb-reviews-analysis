 A Movie for the Toilet Bowl

 Ridley Scott's lame take on a WWF bout

 Ridley, Ridley, what have you done?

 Costumes and Melodrama

 The ending destroyed it for me

 A real stinker of a movie

 over-blown, over-violent and historically outrageous

 THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE IN HISTORY!

 Absolutely Terrible

 USE YOUR MIND, NOT YOUR GLANDS: WATCH "I, CLAUDIUS" INSTEAD!

 The best movie in years...FOR ME TO POOP ON

 What's the big whoop?

 Historical Euphemism par excellence

 the most overrated movie in the history of film.

 Worthless

 I cannot believe that such a film is a year's best movie

 An overrated mess.

 Is this the same guy that made Blade Runner? Seriously?

 A stale plot, older than the Roman Empire!

 Why on Earth Did Everyone Like This Movie?

 All hail Maximus Acronyms - Romans Unite Before Bullying Insurgent Spanish Heman! (possible spoiler in final paragraph)

 Mediocrity - How Ridley Scott yet again neglects the script in favour of the image

 Mindless and Predictable.

 All the cliches ever made up rolled into one movie

 Not as good as others say
