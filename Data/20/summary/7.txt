 Ed5y but Ordinary

 Terrific thriller!!!

 Great thriller if a little cold and dehumanising.

 Very good movie with shocking ending.

 Unlucky number

 genre film with some style

 Divine Murder!

 Good chemistry between characters

 Could Have Beaten "Saw" To The Punch

 Philosophical inquiry about human nature packed as a criminalistic mystery thriller

 Good, but not very good IMO

 scary crimes

 Good movie

 Why is it raining when the sun shines?(a story about contrived elements)

 Literate, Engaging Genre Piece

 The greatest movie I refuse to ever watch again.

 Wonderful movie, just one notch short of a classic.

 Successful for genre, but then again...

 Interesting Mysterious Movie

 A wonderful thriller

 Good Psychological Movie

 Great cameo

 Emotionally draining

 A trash story carried by performances

 Why?
