Now I know there are many classic Hollywood maniacs out there who would probably just assume that I'm just another modern idiot with an attention span shorter than that of a goldfish; too short to appreciate such a film. I've met too many people who would accuse me of such. But I have seen my fair share of silent film, and Metropolis is one of my favorites(and I know few who can make it through that one).The cinematography of this film is truly outstanding when put next to other films from its time. But the story is incredibly basic and some of the things that the characters do don't even make sense. In terms of interest in the story, you can pretty much shut off the movie after the first hour. I can't imagine ever watching this again.If you want an example of outstanding cinematography and early VFX, check definitely check it out. But if you're looking for something along the lines of City Lights(a FAR better film), best skip it all together.
Alright, Im not trying to be an asshole or anything, Im sure it was a great undertaking for the time. But to be honest, I have seen this movie about a hundred times already, in other movies. Simple plot line, very long run time. its kind of going back to that theory that there are only two types of stories, comedies and tragedies and that every story now has already been told. Gloria Gaynor looks like she is wearing a terribly made hairpiece throughout the whole movie. Oh lets talk about things I did like about it... I did like how they did the matte shots.I liked the drunken piglet scene, and the sets they had up for the carnival were pretty cool.
