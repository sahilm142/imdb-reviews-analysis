 Quality tragedy

 Chunks of funny truth in play format

 If you're looking for a comedy, don't watch it. But if you're looking for a drama, don't watch it either!

 Like a Eugene O'neill play

 Alan Alda's Best Work Since M.A.S.H

 Brilliantly dark

 Interesting, but technically flawed.

 Watch it cause I want to keep watching !!!

 Brilliantly written

 The most honest show in a long time

 Take a bow, Louis C.K!
