SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to "weed out all non-hackers". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes "Joker" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes "Cowboy" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes "Gomer Pyle" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. "Joker" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined "hours of boredom, seconds of terror" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. 'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the "duality of Man" according to Jung. 10/10


                
"With flowers and my love both never to come back ... It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black". So sings the man whose throbbing song marks the film's end, merciless lyrics to describe thematically a story that is as wrenching as it is mesmerizing.There are no villains in this film, only heroic victims. The villains are all off-screen, comfy behind mahogany desks, or dressed for success and giving shrill speeches about how maintaining peace requires war. Strange logic.First it's boot camp, a dreary prospect at best, for an ordinary group of young American men. Here, a sadistic drill Sargent, in colorful language, barks out orders and insults straight from Hades. It's do or die, almost literally, for our greenhorns. It's an ordeal of blackness from which some may never recover. Still, the grunts learn a valuable lesson; namely, that life is mostly physical, not mental. It's a lesson some ivory tower college professors never learn.But then it's on to an even blacker black ... Vietnam. Combat scenes are rendered believable by effective visuals and terrific sound effects: pounding percussion, amplified sounds of equipment and footsteps across explosive debris, and an always present, ever-so-subtle ... echo. Potent and torturous, these scenes convey a Zen-like immediacy, an impending sense of doom. And then at film's end, those lyrics ...Composed of two, barely overlapping, parts, the script's structure is a bit unorthodox. But the film works, owing to an intensity that never lets up. R. Lee Ermey is of course terrific as the harsh drillmaster. Casting of the young lions is okay, though a tad weak in one or two cases. Insertion of pop songs of the era works well, to amplify the cultural disconnect between a war-torn Vietnam and an indifferent America.Like reading a history book, watching an occasional war movie is good for the soul. It puts one's problems in perspective. For that reason, this particular war movie is better than most. It's riveting, intense. And the sense of impending blackness hovers ever present over the story's heroic victims, like the sword of Damocles.


                
Goddamn you Stanley Kubrick. For me Clockwork Orange set the standard a long time ago for cinematic perfection; FMJ just raises the bar. Sitting around with bored in-laws I quietly slipped this into the DVD player, 20 minutes later conversation has ceased and everybody is absorbed. Predictable Kubrick really, stunningly lit, musical soundtrack that is oh-so-right, and the cinematography -Jesusmotherofmary. Ten years before anybody had thought of picking up a movie camera and running with it, Kubrick had perfected the technique. War is hell? -it sure looks a vision of hell. Stunning in every way.


                
Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket seems like an uncompleted film, but to me that's poetic justice to one of America's uncompleted wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master.


                
"Full Metal Jacket" is one of the legends of any service person in basic training. As a young recruit in the Army, we talked about it, and we talked about it further and it is one of those movies that you always find something new to say about. The beginning, the young men come to be trained as "killers." And it is at this point where you may realize later that not everyone is meant to be in the military, example, Leonard (Pyle.) He is a nice kid with probably a good sense of humor, probably liked among for his sense of humor and would have done better in college, but instead is in the Marine Corp where he does not fit in well. Then you have Hartman (excellent portrayal by Gunny Ermy) who has the heartless job of making killers out of these young men. It is here that you question if he is truly mean spirited or is doing what he knows he has to do by being as hard as he can so that these young men will survive the horrors of war. This is a point that I think is sometimes missed. Joker, a rather smart young man, attempts to take Leonard under his wing and the two become friends until Leonard messes up and is given a "blanket party" by the rest of the platoon. Hartman is the reason for this, but behind this hides another reason; he has to make them tough and solid so that they will work as a team and have each other's backs in combat. He knows this to be true, but no one else does. This sends Leonard into a psychotic break and for a while, Hartman begins to show interest in Leonard due to his progress. Joker, noticing the change in Leonard, does not bring this to anyone's attention and thus begins his journey through his own private war because he believes from his inaction, he may have been the cause for the aftermath of the confrontation of Leonard and Hartman and the eventual fate of Leonard.After that, the movie shifts and they are in Vietnam and only then does Joker begin to see why Hartman was so mean as he sees his friends become more like Leonard and may be destined to share his fate. When the young sniper is shot is when a part of humanity returns to Joker and we are left to guess at what follows.The performances by Ermy, Modine and D'Onofrio were remarkable, especially D'Onofrio. I often wonder what went on behind the scenes, especially with a seasoned Marine war vet such as R. Lee Ermy on the set. I often wonder how much he contributed to the movie as an actual adviser.By the way, I am a Gulf War I Army Veteran and I am female, so it could be that I may be looking at this differently. Females usually were not in combat situations, but some were. I do wish the movie would have shown that a little, but as far as making you think, I think the movie did what it was suppose to do.
A preliminary note: anyone who liked this movie well enough to read comments should know that a considerable amount of detail in both it and _Apocalypse Now_ had origins in a 1968 Japanese novel called Into a Black Sun, by a Japanese war correspondent working in Vietnam at the time. It took about 20 years to be translated into English, but it's in American paperback now. I recommend it.I just saw this movie for the first time since it was deployed in movie theaters in '87. As then, I was knocked out by what a great film it is. I can't help but contrast it with such movies as Apocalypse Now and Barbarians At The Gate, both movies that I admire, but let's face it, they are florid and melodramatic. Full Metal Jacket is anything but. It is so cold and hard in tone that it freezes your bones. At the same time, both the cinematography and sound track are so good, so effective, that the watcher can't look away from the movie.This is classic Kubrick, in my opinion: the correct correlation of visual and audio information, with a plot that is so horrifying that one lies awake for awhile.


                
Stanley Kubrick always managed to bring something new to his palate whenever he made a film. He brought dark comedy to the screen with Dr. Stranglove, an epic story with Spartacus, and a film more important for its efforts than box office potential in the film Paths of Glory. This is what makes Full Metal Jacket so entertaining.Humor, horror and political commentary are the themes which shape Full Metal Jacket. From the overbearing drill sergeant to the war loving soldiers. It all seems to make sense within this film, never overstepping its bounds or being to subtle. Kubrick may have alienated some his hardcore fans with such a mainstream-type story, but then again, he helped mainstream movies take a bold step. What doesn't the current cinema owe Kubrick?


                
Saw this film at the age at 22, and just re watched it 22 years later. The brutality of war shocked me at 22 and shocked me again at 44. One of the best war/drama's ever to be put on film, but it got me thinking! When will humanity ever learn? world war 1 and 2, Korea, Vietnam, then the gulf wars, Iraq, Afghanistan, and all the same mistakes made again and again, and all for what? To feed the politicians needs to flex their urge to send young people to the other side of the planet to get wasted? And then when we make so called peace then to invite the enemy to come and live in our countries? Ask your self who is the real winner and loser of all these wars? Great film but think about the reality of it all, voice your views to your local politicians and get our young people to come back home in 1 piece.


                
This film is really scary and easily one of the best films ever made. There are many reasons to say that. Private Pyle is definitely one of the most disturbing character ever written in the history of cinema. Other characters as disturbing as him are Antonio Ricci of 'Bicycle thief', Devdas Mukerjee etc. Beginning is mindblowing. All the characters are defined in the first scene itself. Joker and Pyle stand out as wrong people in the wrong place. Later Joker gets a promotion for his straightforwardness in the first scene. Its interesting because may be thats how officers are identified amongst 'pukes'. Pyle comes across as regular jovial 'fatbody'. What marines make of him is I think the whole concept of the film. Very weird piece of writing. Most of the things have already been discussed so I'll be really short. I'm surprised no one has said anything about the background music. This movie has brilliant background music. All the Pyle's scene are brilliant. 'Last night on the island' will remain one of the best scenes ever shot in the history of cinema. I must admit that I got really scared when I watched it for the first time. Vincent D'Onofrio shocked me in every scene. Very gifted man. I watched the whole film and then I watched the first half twice and some scenes again and again. R. Lee Ermey and Matthew Modine are good too but this is definitely Vincent D'Onofrio's film. "This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine". Mind blowing. By the way the order of Joker, cowboy and Pyle keeps changing as Hartman walks in the first scene. Probably Kubrick didn't think that he would have someone watch this film that many times. Masterpiece!!! 10/10.


                
Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" does for the Vietnam war what "Saving Private Ryan" did for WWII- create a strikingly (and sometimes disturbingly) realistic portrait of the horrors of war. However, FMJ's depiction of the de-humanizing affects of boot camp and later the psychological effects of war on soldiers (similar to Apocalypse Now) set it apart from many other war films, such as Private Ryan. Matthew Modine and Adam Baldwin give excellent performances of de-sensitized GIs, but the true standout of the cast is R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor at Paris Island boot camp. Despite the fact that the film was shot entirely in Britain, Kubrick does a very convincing job of recreating Vietnam there, and all aspects of the film are very realistic and authentic. Also unlike other war films, FMJ doesn't focus on the action and violence (which is still very realistic) and instead relies on complex characters to drive the story. Modine's Pvt. Joker is especially interesting, dying to get into action one minute, but once the bullets start whizzing, scared out of his wits.Bottom Line: an excellent war film, and should be considered one of the best of all time. ***1/2 out of ****


                
Full Metal Jacket (1987)Full Metal Jacket seems like 2 great short films rolled into one. The first half is a film about boot camp the second follows a correspondent into urban combat in Vietnam. The first half is incredible; the boot camp is tense and realistic. But it's a good thing that it doesn't last the whole film. I don't think that it could have been as extreme, they would have had to stretch it out and it would have lost its fast paced action. R Lee Ermey pretty much steals the show in the first half. His performance is impressive and one of the most memorable performances in any war film. Many other characters had good performances as well, mostly Vincent D'Onofrio. His performance starts out seemingly poor. The further his character (Gomer Pyle) gets pushed and the more he starts to look crazy the better performance he gives. Seems like hes better at playing a crazy person than a mentally slow person. ****first part spoiler****We finish part one with one of the most tense scenes in all of film, with all three main characters giving their best performances. Knowing Kubrick's perfectionism this scene must have been just as tense to shoot as the final outcome. Pyle snaps, kills Hartman, kills himself and no matter how many times I see it, my jaw still drops. The look on D'Onofrio's face is incredible, such pain and insanity. It helps make the scene as memorable as it is, one of the greatest facial performances (is that a term?) ever.****end spoilers****Just as it seems like the film is over the second half jumps in. moving from tension at his highest straight into Vietnam and a hooker walking to the beat of "These Boots are Made for Walking" A very strange transition that actually works out great. The second half is still a great movie but not as much as the first half. It's a lot like your average war movie in a lot of ways but still very distinct. We see much different kinds of characters than the average Vietnam movie. Usually it's a bunch of hard asses and one guy who doesn't like what they are doing, while we do see both of those types, we see many others as well. Due to the styles of fighting it's actually more like a World War 2 film rather than Vietnam because its urban warfare rather than in the jungle. I don't have as much to say about the second half. It's fantastic but nothing that stands out from other great war movies. Great soundtrack, directing, writing, acting, fighting, all of that, just not as memorable as the first half.****spoilers****My favorite thing about the second half is that, though they complete little missions, nothing really gets accomplished. It could have ended with the killing of the sniper but that would have made it seem like that was the mission and that finished it. By adding the last scene of the soldiers walking singing the Mickey Mouse song it showed that the war wasn't over and nothing really has changed for them, or the war. I'm guessing this is probably how a lot of people felt during the war, and even after it. Kubrick didn't mean for this to be an anti war film, but by showing the war the way it was, it can't really be seen as anything but that, in my opinion. ****end spoilers****Any fan of Kubrick's work should definitely watch this film. Anyone that's a fan of war films or really fans of movies in general should not miss this one either. One of cinema's best. 10/10
This is one of the best war (or anti-war) films that I have seen. It is a tale told in two parts. In the first part we follow green recruits as they go through basic training on Parris Island. It is the first part of the story that introduces us to two truly unforgettable characters: Drill Instructor Hartman is a terrifying figure who uses both verbal and physical abuse to mold his men into Marines. Hartman is superbly played by real-life ex-Marine R. Lee Ermey, and not a single word of his seems fake or contrived. The second unforgettable character is Pvt. Leonard Lawrence, better known as Pyle. From the first time you see him on screen you get the feeling that something isn't right. The overweight recruit takes the worst of Hartman's abuse, is humiliated, betrayed by a friend and finally completely broken down until he becomes the picture of quiet madness. The first part of the story ends with a shocking act of violence that shows what can happen when you ask ordinary men to become killing machines.The second part of the story finds Joker (the character who narrates the film) in Vietnam, now a Sergeant and a writer for Stars and Stripes. His job is not as much about reporting the truth as it is about boosting morale. Joker is a walking contradiction, a Marine who wears a peace button, yet has "BORN TO KILL" written on his helmet. In this part of the story we meet another memorable character, Animal Mother, an unbalanced individual who while standing over the bodies of two fallen comrades says without emotion, "Better you than me". The last shots of Marines marching through fiery ruins while singing the Mickey Mouse Club theme song could best be described as haunting. If war is hell, then these are the damned.A great script, great cinematography, a solid cast and a good soundtrack all brought together by a great director. This film stands above all other Vietnam War movies, rivaled only by Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Full Metal Jacket is a film that everyone should see at least once, although it retains it's power even after repeated viewings. A truly great film.
People just refuse to use their brains. They love the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and then basically give up on the second half. It is depressing. Don't you think you should at least try to understand why the film is split up like that? In fact, despite what so many people think, Full Metal Jacket is a perfectly structured opus - one of the most original pieces of art ever created. I am not going to get into it, but I will just say that it is YOUR JOB AS A VIEWER to figure out the connection between the two halves. 10/10.


                
Stanley Kubrick has put up another fine masterpiece about the USMC getting reading for the Vietnam War. "Full Metal Jacket" shows how Marine life is not child's play, and the Drill Seargant from Hell(R. Lee Ermey, aka "The Gunny") really performed well in this movie. It is set in Parris Island, S.C., were the main Corp was locate to whip these civilians into shape. Gunnery Sgt. Hartman(Ermey) is one heck of a bad-a$$ Drill Sgt. who takes no crap from anyone. He didn't discriminate anyone, he treated everyone like an equal. However, he tortured Pvt. Pyle(Vincent D'Onofrio) so bad, he went over the edge after the training. He marched with his pants down, sucked on his thumb like a little boy, and had to endure a very brutal beating from the other Privates. Socking a drill Sergeant will call for a discharge or time in confinement, shooting him will result in court martial, and a dishonorable discharge. Of course, Pyle discharged himself with the same gun. The other went on and the brutal battle is ensured. The Marines don't play around, and they really show the sign of brotherhood of the Corp. The chants the Gunny made was a classic. "This is my rifle, this is my gun..." is the one song I think should be shared to only the military. It's always lock and load. This movie is a must for all members of the USMC. Whether they are recruits or vets, I this this movie a major SEMPER FI! CARRY ON! 5 STARS, OORAH!


                
This is an excellent film that shows that film maker Stanley Kubrick has lost none of his skill despite a 7 year break between projects.The film is plotted in two distinct parts, the first half, which is the stronger part is concerned with the impact of brutal training on the wannabe soldiers, with the second part focusing on the story told from the central character, Private Joker, played by an effective Matthew Modine in a deliberate low key and understated manner. In fact most of the performances are subdued, with the exception of Adam Baldwin as a cynical and brutal Animal Mother and particularly Lee Ermey, who steals the show as the ruthless drill sergeant. He is totally captivating in the role, even if his character spends most of his time by humiliating the recruits - though the film posits that there are potentially tragic consequences with this approach as well as the production of a group of lethal killers.The second part of the film is still effective though, even it isn't quite as captivating as the first half. Vietnam is very well realised, particularly since it was shot in London's Docklands, which was derelict at the time! This is a tribute to Kubrick's skill as a director, particularly with his use of steadicam to develop a cold, objective realism peppered with black humour. Huge credit must also go Anton Furst's outstanding work as production designer and Vivian Kubricks score, though minimalist, is interesting and gives a refreshing and different feel to this non-typical war film. Martin Hunter's editing is also first rate.In summary and efficient, and highly effective observation of the dehumanisation of warfare on the soldier made with trademark Kubrick precision


                
Since the first time I saw this film when I was 7 years old I couldn't stop watching it, I've never like kids movies or cartoon movies, for some reason during my childhood id spend my time watching war and sci-fi movies, my favorite war films are Das Boot and Full Metal Jacket, I saw these films when I was around 6 or 7 years old and I was impressed with the directing and acting, full metal jacket shows the reality of war and what we humans really are and what we are for and what we can and cant do,this is Stanley Kubrick at his very best! if you think saving private Ryan, the thin red line or platoon are good war movies?, you are wrong! just watch this film and you will see why its the best war movie ever! a complete masterpiece, 10/10.
In late 1966, a thought occurred to me and and inked the very tag line above onto the back of my camouflage helmet cover. All my buddies loved it and it got around quickly in the 4th Infantry Division. Unfortunately for me, that was ten years before the Copyright Act of 1976 that gave the copyright of anything written to the author the moment he put it in writing. Otherwise, Kubrik would be paying me, but I would not ask for much. It WAS the feeling. I disliked the Marine Corp. Their attitude in general, the tough guys, heroes, belied their actual performance in Vietnam. US Army units in I Corps and II Corps spent much of their time rescuing Marines pinned down by Charlie. They knew little of the concept, "recon in FORCE". The sniper scene depicts the true effects of 7.62 or 7.65 ammo on a body. The finale, with Joker finally pulling the trigger on the girl made him "part of...". The Mickey Mouse song was another standard "in country". Believe me, "it never goes away".
The comments by many vets on this site, saying that this film to some degree reflects the nature of war, should be the highest praise for this film. I scanned the reviews looking for the comments of vets and found, in the first 14 pages, 6 vets stating that key elements of this film mirrored to some degree their experiences in Vietnam. I found this movie amazing. I agree with many of the more widely-held conclusions about this film. R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman is incredible, as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the tragic Pvt. Pyle. There certainly are two sections to this film, but the inspiration for both parts come from the same book and so, if both parts of the movie can be inspired by the same real lives, then it seems we should accept that both parts reflect different aspects of the military experience. I think that is fair. Capturing the emotional and psychological brutality of bootcamp, along with the horrors and the banality of war seem to be reasonable things to include in the same film.If anyone thinks that this film glamorizes war-from the death of Pvt. Pyle to the predicted destruction of the unit charged with taking out the sniper, as well as the sniper at the end of the film-they must be a psychopath.


                
I know it is certainly a big call to call this the best Vietnam movie of all time, but this is probably the most realistic account of it. It is also a great example of Director Kubrick's ability to show humans objectively, not trying to make out whether one is evil or not.Essentially the movie is divided into two parts. The first revolves around the training of marines, and shows the brutality of becoming a soldier. The second part then focuses on the actual battlefield.What is interesting about this film is that it isn't particularly violent, but still extremely powerful. This is about the psychology of War, about how various soldiers deal with a mad mad situation, and it does a great job of depicting this.Everything about this film is great. The acting is top notch from a cast of mostly unknowns, and the score is used to haunting effect. Camera shots also brilliantly portray the scenes, often from the point of view of the person shooting, to great effect. And if anything can be said to recommend this film, it is that there many great scenes that you will definitely never forget. A masterpiece.


                
War is hell, but boot camp is worse. At least that's the impression I got from watching "Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick's second anti-war classic in thirty years (the first was 1957's "Paths of Glory.") Since it's based on fact, "Full Metal Jacket" is not as mind-bending as "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "The Shining," but it has all of Kubrick's visual trademarks: harsh, bright lighting; cold, impersonal settings; and lots of whites, reds, and golds. Like the other movies, it deals with ordinary Americans seeking to survive in a hostile environment: first, boot camp, run by a psycho drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey), then urban warfare in Hue City, where they must contend with both the Viet Cong and their own superiors. The boot camp sequence is the best part of the movie: Ermey's sergeant character is clearly out of control, but he's not really a bad guy: he's just doing his job, trying to teach the recruits the skills they will need if they're going to survive in Vietnam. To see Vincent D'Onofrio as the slug-like "Gomer Pyle," then see him in his present role as Detective Robert Goran in "Law and Order: Criminal Intent" is to see just how much this amazing actor has grown. Matthew Modine's Joker is the voice of reason and the story's anchor. The combat scenes are horrifying, but the movie ends on an oddly upbeat note, the troops singing the "Mickey Mouse Club" theme song as they pull out of Hue. Add a killer soundtrack of 60s rock and roll and a hilarious cameo by Papillon Soo Soo as a consumptive Vietnamese hooker, and you've got a winner. Maybe not as good as "Saving Private Ryan," but still a great war film.
I have heard of the idea that every war movie is in fact an anti-war movie, because they all show the horror and brutality of the situation.I do not agree.Some war films, while showing violence and blood, have stories describing how war gives people the potential to be heroes; movies like 'Saving Private Ryan', 'A Bridge Too Far' and even 'The Great Escape' fall into this trap; they seem to say that, even though war is terrible, some good can come from it.A true anti-war film has no heroes. The statement is very clear: war turns men into vicious animals, with no drives except to eat, copulate, and kill. Films in this category include 'King Rat', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'Platoon', and of course Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'.With 'Jacket', Kubrick provides what is perhaps the most comprehensive and complete overview of how human beings are de-evolved through the military process. He begins in boot camp, where they are treated as scum, beaten and abused, and (in some cases) driven completely mad. By the time they reach the field, they are "killing machines...angels of death", and the horror of battle only makes it worse.They suppress fear, pity, love...and and all emotions that distinguish humans from animals. Sex is purely physical gratification, and killing is a rush. There is no loyalty or patriotism; the desire to retrieve a wounded comrade is more akin to how a pack of wolves protects one of its own. They act on instinct rather than reason, and they do not hesitate to destroy everything they see.That is the plot of Full Metal Jacket. The movie itself is a scathing example of how horrible war truly is. Perhaps there is the potential for heroism...but few, if any, rise to it.


                
He could be cold, harsh and mechanical with his style, precise as a surgeon's knife, and some didn't like that, but who better to make a film, not about war, but about the dehumanisation of the process, but Stanley Kubrick? The fact his vision of the story was so clinical really helped make this, quietly, the best war film ever made; Stanely never did things by halves.Every frame is weighted with oppression, each moment is saying something; every line, every gesture, delivered to fit Kubrick's vision. It made a star of Lee Ermey, whose Drill Sergeant was terrifyingly real, primarily because that is what he was in reality.Like all of Kubrick's work, this film contains iconic imagery that sears into your mind's eye and becomes very hard to erase; the final scenes, and the film's closing, with its perfect marriage of image, sound, and music, haunt you and leave you reflecting on the last 2 two hours.


                
With all of Stanley Kubrick's films, I have never been disappointed by any of them. From Dr. Strangelove to Full Metal Jacket, his work has captured my eyes and made many of my days.Its amazing how well Kubrick forms his characters and gets you to almost be in their shoes. Especially in Full Metal Jacket, its fun to see how the characters in every scene act or turn out.One of my favorite aspects of Kubrick is making a man look insane or crazy such as in A Clockwork Orange (with his character Alexander), the Shining (Mr. Torrence) and in Full Metal Jacket (Private Pyle) which was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.R. Lee Ermey's character was played so well, I felt as if I was being lectured by him. His smart and funny remarks made the beginning of the movie all the more enjoyable.So in the end, you must see this movie if you think you appreciate movies.********** out of **********


                
Vietnam war as depicted by the master itself: Stanley Kubrick. Funny moments, sad moments and everything in between. This movie shows the many aspects of war and it's effect on human condition. Many people seem to think it gets weaker after the boot camp and the second part isn't as good, I like the whole movie, the second half has at least the same amount of memorable scenes if not more!
