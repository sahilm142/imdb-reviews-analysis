 Near perfection

 Great final season and episode

 'The Americans' subverts a genre, along with its audience

 Intriguing

 Solid start to the series. Something subtle, Something powerful

 This show swings both ways

 The best spy series so far

 Well isn't this a purty little gem of a show!!!

 One of the very best

 Fitting outcome to a great series

 Great Program!

 An excellent show. Great casting, good acting, incredible details and even the setting looks surprisingly authentic

 From stem to stern, remarkable television

 Just fantastic

 Did not miss one episode for the entire 6 seasons

 Artfully woven; nostalgic in a way.

 Riveting - Soviet spies in the midst of the US

 A great and inventive new show!

 Riddled with plot holes but still very exciting

 Riveting....

 9/10 for the series but...

 2010s plot and villain clichés in a 1980s cold war setting

 Fresh idea make it worth it

 A Grim Reminder Of What Russians Do

 Fantastic!
