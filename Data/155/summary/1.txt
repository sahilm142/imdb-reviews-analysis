 Just saw it and had to make sure the score was right...

 Seriously 8.3

 overrated trite

 Inspired by the cliffs-notes of a great novel, Blade Runner is, unfortunately, not widely recognized as a fecal insult to literature

 Blade Runner. All style, no substance.

 Like A Replicant's Tears In The Rain

 Pathetic Mesh

 Without Hyperbole, Worst Sci-Fi Ever

 I may have seen a different movie

 What's with...?

 OVER HYPED!

 Beyond boring!

 Unnecessarily cruel movie

 The worst sci-fi of all time.

 Warning, you can't get a refund on your time.

 Pointless, boring and a very UGLY movie

 Has the whole world gone mad?

 Waste of time and Money

 terrible

 Harrison Ford is not keen on it either

 Can Hollywood Leave Well Enough Alone? The Best Cut Was The First Cut

 Better than a sleeping pill

 Piece of Junk

 highly overrated

 No plot, no fun, no relation to Philip K. Dick
