 A cinematic achievement that never truly grows old.

 Scared as a kid

 There's no place like Oz!

 Oz is that place somewhere over the rainbow

 Too bad no one sees the whole version anymore

 You should never believe that this movie is from the 30'

 Fun, Colorful.....At Least For Two Viewings

 Good fun to be had

 Very Enjoyable

 An old Favorite

 A true classic, if ever I saw one

 A perennial favourite

 Very gorgeous and beautiful - but is it the best?

 Don't get me wrong, I like this movie...

 Good movie

 An excellent film but pales in comparison to the Baum book!

 Wait a minute!

 Campy fairy tale that is strangely heavy-handed.

 Off to the yellow brick road.

 a rather disappointing film

 Excellent

 Amazing...

 I liked its messages

 An excellent fantasy adventure

 The value of Oz is a no-brainer
