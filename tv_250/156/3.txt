I've seen a few episodes of the first season of Coupling (UK version), and I honestly can't understand why the Brits love it so much. The humor relies entirely on one-liner jokes, backed up with a cheap canned laugh-track. It reminds me of the dozens of forgettable stupid sitcoms that have come and gone over the years; in all, nothing special here.Now, I certainly don't mind infantile humor or sex jokes (quite the contrary), but they've got to actually be funny to make me laugh. I barely cracked a smile during the painful hour-and-a-half I devoted to the first few episodes of Coupling I endured before I started fast-forwarding and finally gave up altogether. (And yes, I'm referring to the original UK version.) The people who thought this show was "hilarious" have clearly never seen a minute of Arrested Development, Curb Your Enthusiasm, or Newsradio.I started watching Coupling because of the show's writer Steven Moffat, whose unforgettable, brilliant work on Doctor Who and Jekyll made me crave more. But this type of writing is clearly not his strong suit. Moffat's dramatic and sci-fi writing is superb; unfortunately, Coupling was a waste of his time and mine.
