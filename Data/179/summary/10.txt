 Shock and Awe

 Slow burner with a twist for the ages. Fincher does it again.

 Best performance of an actress for 2014!

 If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded.

 Every single element is incredibly, undeniably good.

 It Surprises you and those 150 minutes never feel that long

 Fincher has done it again! A brilliant thriller with outstounding acting turns

 An ending so awful you want to go and head butt a brick

 "Gone Girl"- A remarkable character-centric mystery/drama that excels courtesy its incredible performers and David Fincher's expert direction.

 What can I say David Fincher has done it again

 Convincing story and brilliantly cast, a sure-fire shot for Best Picture.

 Unsure why this movie has so many negative reviews....
