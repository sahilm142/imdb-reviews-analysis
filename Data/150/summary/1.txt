 It should have been called Satyrs of LI instead of Wolf of Wall Street

 Con Man cons Scorsese & DiCaprio

 A Farce you can skip.

 Don't waste your time

 Sad way to glamorize immoral behavior, long and drawn out.

 Loud and Flat Failure

 A big Waste of time and money for backers and customers

 The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen...

 A masterful depiction of human piggishness

 Howler Wolf

 One of the worst movies ever

 As much a scam as Belfort himself

 Horrible

 another over hyped movie that fails to make a point.

 Over acted, repetitive, every scene and the film itself too long

 Awful movie - borders on audience abuse

 The glorification of a narcissistic sociopath

 This is for Scorsese what EYES WIDE SHUT was for Kubrick (SPOILERS)

 Never have I seen a movie with so many big names performing so badly

 soft porn flick

 Save your money--contains spoiler info...

 Do you want your money to support someone lower than pond scum?

 Its like watching Hell for 3hrs!!! Never seen such a horrible movie in my life..

 Pick a Freakin' Genre!

 This was a horrible movie
