 An amazing series from start to finish... well, almost.

 Everything's great but...

 It was good half way and then just dropped.

 No mercy.

 Great but not one of the best shows of all time

 It's not a lame karate. It's Cobra Kai!

 A lot of fun...for the most part.

 It's a good show but...

 A lot better than I expected

 Radicalizing Underdogs

 Good Potential - Dialog and Acting a Little Flat

 Of the first 2 episodes... they're okay!

 A lot of fun, but a little bit naive

 All the Spirit, Half The Heart!

 If You Haven't Already You Want To Watch Cobra Kia for.........

 More episodes, more CGI

 Acting not great but it has something
