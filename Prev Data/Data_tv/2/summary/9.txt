 Finally, a Show that stays true to it's written roots

 Really Surprised!

 On finding Game of Thrones on VHS

 It made me go out and buy the books!

 Superb

 As good as TV can get

 Will this be another show HBO gets me hooked, before unceromoniously dumping it for inexplicable reasons?

 At Last - Adult Fantasy For Tolkien Non-Enthusiasts

 Exceptional storytelling with unmatched depth

 Nothing ever beats a book...but this is damn close so far

 Easily The Greatest Fantasy Television Show Ever, And Better Than Most Fantasy Films.

 Deserved of a Throne

 Want to Be Entertained; Pull Up a Seat

 Excellent Adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire

 A new dimension to an old story

 Too light to watch

 Complex and Addictive

 Believe the hype

 Noble history, attitudes, and dreams in a nutshell

 Great on the surface...ran into the ground

 Well Cast, Well Acted, Well Done

 outstanding, but, I'm afraid, most likely popular for the wrong reasons

 Excellent adaptation

 A true masterpiece

 It's the best movie ever made, except it never has to end.
