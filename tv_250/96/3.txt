More historical adventures with a new version of Black-Adder.While I admire the talents over everyone in this series, and respect the fact that it is so beloved 31 years after it aired I can't say I enjoyed this show that much.While it has its moments, and a wonderful central performance from Rowan Atkinson, it sadly isn't a show that I'd rush to watch again.Comedy is subjective, more so than any other genre perhaps, and this just didn't do a lot for me.
