 this picture must mean a lot to americans...

 Like the chocolate in a box, my feelings are mixed....

 Neither as good or as bad...

 Surprisingly enjoyable

 "movie seems far-fetched"

 love this movie

 Be simple and you'll be happy

 entertaining but shallow

 Forrest Gump

 Good

 Great storyline but not a great value promoted

 Average Movie

 10/10

 Oh....Thanks

 The movie is a film adaptation of the book "Forrest Gump"

 My Opinion

 why to watch Forrest Gump (1994

 he better run...after all them chocolates!!!

 Great crowd pleaser with stellar acting and a very good story.

 Best Movie I Have Seen

 Touches One's Heart

 Forrest Gump is and always should be a remembered movie.

 Doesn't stand up

 Good but not great

 Superman + Homer Simpson = Forrest Gump
