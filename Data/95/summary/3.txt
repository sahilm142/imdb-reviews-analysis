 Ridiculous cartoon strip movie

 not worth the time - a HUGE disappointment

 Unbelievable

 Brad Pitt wins the war

 Schlock and Awe.

 Bellow average note from me...

 Not Very Glourious

 Quentin's Worst!!

 Inglouriously overrated

 When you lose your heart and soul as an artist....

 Absolute dogshit!

 Wow bad

 Trailer so misleading, movie more farce than "Western" War flick

 Rotting faeces masquerading as 'Tarentino Art'

 Canned cheese

 Far from the best of Tarantino's work.

 tragically bad. very poor choice of German actors doesn't help either

 An absolutely terrible movie

 What's happened to QT?

 Applauding to violence

 It's OK, but nothing special

 If you like blood and gore but lack intelligence this is for you!

 Inglourious Basterds Not So Glorious

 Torture Porn

 1 hour less would have been "glourious"
