First three seasons got 9 out of 10 stars from the wife and me. We didn't watch for the Whodunit, but for the interplay between the characters, particularly Morse and Thursday. The restrained Englishness of the tough (in many surprising ways) father figure of Roger Allum's Thursday as he mentored the younger Morse was compelling and emotionally honest. That, along with the battles by Morse to remain ethically principled and true to himself as he sought to bring order to the world were great, great stuff.In the first two episodes of Season Four, the creative team seems to have forgotten where their real strengths lie. Both episodes focused very strongly on the mystery/problem, and gave us very, very little by way of the much more engaging personal interactions between the many characters. Hope they find their way back to what made the series great in the remaining episodes.
