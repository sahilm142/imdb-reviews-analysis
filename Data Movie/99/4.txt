Honestly, i can't stand Chaplin: i don't like his comedy with very strong effects, his endless pursuits and loud morals... In a way, he doesn't give a choice to his audience: they must laugh, they must cry... I prefer to have my freedom to make an opinion: in the same genre, Mr Bean is really funny and the episode when he receives a baby is more enjoyable than this long one...
Here the only things that i found good: mother and son acting, and the depiction of American slums and nobodies. There is a certain compassion that i can't deny, especially today when slums and nobodies have totally disappeared in American cinema while they have never been so much in the real life. So maybe we need another Charlot today...
