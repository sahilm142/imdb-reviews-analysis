I kept hearing how 'great' this show was and finally, after watching tons of other decent shows, I grueled through season 1 of this - I can't go any further, what an incredible letdown and a waste of hours and hours of my life. Breaking Bad was great, Sons of Anarchy was great, hell even NCIS blows this series away monumentally, This was seriously like they took the worst episode of any random cop show and turned it into an entire season of drawn out eventless tripe. I'm literally laughing at all the 'praising' reviews by this site's members... are they paid to say this stuff? Are they bots? Just wow.
Ok I get at the time the wire was great but it doesn't hold the test of time at all. And some of the dialogue is laughable. And the plot really it's that good. I really wanted to like this but I couldn't


                
Great for reinforcing your liberal knee-jerks if you're out of practice. Otherwise, stick to Law & Order. Has little to do with real people or real life. That's why the critics love it. The characters are about as 'real' as the clean, well-groomed 'bikers' in the afternoon soaps. David Simon's concept of 'sociopolitical' seems to be beating liberal drums, and not much else. It takes more than a little dirt and a few scars to portray real criminals and victims. It takes going beyond the typical 'liberals vs. bad guys'... There are world views that encompass those beyond Planned Parenthood, Al Sharpton and the NAACP, but you have to turn the channel to find them.


                
Yeh this show is just plane out bad. I really wanted to like like this but I mean there was nothing at all good about. The characters were just bad and uninteresting. Then the writing was done by people who may have known about the incity but nothing about plot. There is a reason this show wasn't Nominated for anything it sucked. I mean the theams are good but so are the theams in The Phantom Menace wich doesn't make it a good movie.
