This is the first time I'm writing a review on a movie, and many might argue with it. But I couldn't help myself.I really don't understand why this movie is rated high. IMO the story was very typical, and the acting was awful. Too many examples, but I just can't get one of them out of my head: The scene where the defendant's wife is blown by the lawyer. This kind of acting I would expect to see in comedy shows, which I would not usually. That's because I never thought such thing existed but now I can laugh so hard thanks to this movie. Or the tricks (if you could call them that) used by the lawyers against each other were just ridiculous. One says a word the other takes back the question entirely?!After enjoying Anatomy of a Murder, I found this movie recommended on the same page with higher rating. Expectations high, I watched it. May be I didn't get it but I think it doesn't even deserve a 5 out of 10. I usually get good recommendations from IMDb but this was not one of them. The only good thing in the movie that I might consider was the little surprise near the end. Finally I obviously would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they're willing to throw away about 2 hours of their time.


                
This 1957 courtroom drama of ultimate treachery and betrayal was frequently spoiled for me by that sniveling, pompous actor, Charles Laughton, who played the "Sir" Wilfred Roberts character.IMO - Laughton (and his insufferable blubbering) was given way-way too much screen-time. And I sure got real sick of his shtick - Real fast.As expected - Marlene Dietrich gets to do her trademark "man-drag" thing, once again, in this picture. You know, I think that she has been given the chance to do this same, tiresome business in at least a third of all the films that she has ever appeared in.*Note* - This would be Tyrone Power's final film. He died of a heart attack the following year after its release. He was 44 at the time.
