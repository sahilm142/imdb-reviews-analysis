Thank you sir B.R Chopra and all other cast to introduce us with this Indian epic, don't know if i ever read this epic or Bhagavad-Geeta on my own. When you starts watching it from very first episode might be you would not like it very much but after watching continuously 2-3 episode you will find that you are start liking it and after watching further You will find that You are becoming addicted to it.And after watched completely you would know about Hinduism,meaning of Dharam,Geeta,what actually religion is and its aspects?? and many more things which will be very helpful in every moment of your life.This is for everyone..
