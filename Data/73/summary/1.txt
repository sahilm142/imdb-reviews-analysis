 The Great Cinema Swindle

 Tried it, just can't take it!

 Overrated

 If Orson Welles was smarter he would have made CASABLANCA

 Terrible

 I don't know why this movie is such a classic. It sucks.

 Talk About BORING!!

 AFI #1 but not mine

 i hate to say this but i was underwhelmed by this movie

 A film with no redeeming qualities, by no means a classic.

 What da..........

 The Hyperbole of Genius

 I don't understand what the hype is about?

 Astoundingly Over-rated

 Very overrated

 This movie is unbelievably over-rated

 Awful, the worst movie ever!!

 I would rather go to the dentist

 such a let down

 This is so bad.

 I had Great Expectations - But this movie was awful

 A medieval form of torture.

 Worst Movie EVER!

 Wake up everybody! this film is BORing, turgid & unemotional!

 Doesn't continue to live
