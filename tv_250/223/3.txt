One could call it One Pie and I couldn't blame them. Comparing it with Dragon Ball, Naruto, or Bleach is a total nonsense, they are not even the same genre.While the other mentioned animes are about the character aiming to be better and better, obviously getting stronger and more developed, One Piece has nothing of it. It CAN'T have any of it.This series is suffering The Course of Super Mario, aka. "Your Princess is in Another Castle". Well, at least they don't suffer The Curse of Ash Ketchum aka. "Your Princess Doesn't Exist", but that's the best you can bring into its defense.The basic structure is that this crew looking like they were designed by David Lynch (terrible writer/director, excellent designer) hop onto a random island, beat up the local governor who is usually a tyrant, then leave the scene. They don't even take any loot, despite aiming to be pirates. Rinse and repeat. This of course happens because the only real way to tell the story would be 1) get the map 2) get to the island 3) dig up the treasure 4) there is no 4th step, it ends by finding the treasure. To make things even worse, the protagonist is immortal and invincible from the get-go, thus there is no space for tension or development.I give you the coloration is OK, and the animation is achieving in the weird factor, but that doesn't substitute the 1,000 episodes they're obviously aiming. Pick up a random Tom&Jerry episode, or Simpsons, and you get the same result with much less investment.
