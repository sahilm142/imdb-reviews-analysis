 In my opinion, Coppola's best work

 The Dark Side of Man

 This Is the End...

 My All Time Favourite Movie

 You love it, or you hate it....

 The bravest , most honest account of the futility of war ever filmed.

 One of the best and most important movies ever

 Lives Up To Its Title

 skip Redux version, watch original first

 Truly a Masterpiece

 "The horror...the horror" is the reality of war and its effects...

 In my top five favorite films ever made

 Never get out of the boat unless you are going all the way.

 Apocalypse<U+0097>nothing happens<U+0097>Now.

 Madness.

 My favorite film

 Into the mind of madness.

 Possibly the most ambitious film ever made...

 Incredible Adaption of Conrad's "The Heart of Darkness" -- Possibly Coppola's Masterpiece

 Insanity is Not a Theme

 Apocalypse Now Redux ought to be treated separately here

 Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time

 The greatest film ever made, but not "Redux"

 "redux" is SACRILEGE!!!
