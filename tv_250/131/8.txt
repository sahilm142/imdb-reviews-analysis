"Saint Seiya" was an important part of my childhood.Here in Brazil it was a very big success ( I don't have a single friend who didn't watch this series when they were a kid)and It was also the first anime I started to watch. After it, I became a big anime fan. Being inspired in many different mythologies like the Greek and the Nordic ones,and also having some influence in the zodiac signs, we have a very cool story with lots of action and different types of fighters. I remember so many memorable fights,each one better then the other, and we see the the story of each one of the characters as long as the episodes are being seem. Nowadays we have the Hades OAVS(OVAS)that are the continuation of this saga, and also have awesome elements and surprising powers of some of the characters. I would recommend this anime for everyone who loves scenes of fights and mythological aspects.
hum....a childhood animation series! Good story, good animation, lots of actions, excellent characters and a great soundtrack, "Knights of the Zodiac", "Saint Seya" or "Cavaleiros do Zodiaco", is a an excellent Japanese "manga", later put on screen in a television animation series, and like almost the Japanese "anime", this one is pretty good!Its basically a good vs evil fight,where the good guys (the Bronze Knights) kick ass the bad guys, over and over again,always to save Princess Athena from the evil ones which always tend to rule the world..Its an original story based on mythology, legends and myths, an eternal fight of light and darkness.
