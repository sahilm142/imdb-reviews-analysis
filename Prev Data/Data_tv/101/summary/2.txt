 Key evidence left out. Producers had political agenda.

 FURIOUS with Netflix over this bio-pic

 Very over-rated and painful to watch= should be a podcast

 Very poorly done documentary, impairs their message

 Not a documentary

 BIASED and MISLEADING. Do NOT fall for it.

 Lame new lawyer grasping at straws

 Propaganda

 An utter circus

 One sided story for slow thinkers and conspiracy theorists

 Shocking and irritating - at first

 Extremely Drawn Out
