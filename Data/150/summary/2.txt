 Encompasses everything wrong with Hollywood's arrogant attitude towards its audience

 Scumbag fest

 Utter Waste of Talent.

 Save yourself 3 hours..... don't bother!

 Ideas have and will have consequences

 The Dud on Lame Street

 Not a good use of our time

 Scorsese's worst effort ever.

 Don't be fooled by the overall rating of this movie

 Crass and Vulgar

 When You've Seen Jonah Hill Masturbate, You already have had enough.

 Just the WOLF...

 Better Choice in Genre

 movie with a wrong name

 it is what i expected but not my favorite of my fav director, scorsese-

 It's like a Spring Break party

 Fap fap fap fap fap

 Ugly, repulsive, screechy and boring

 Horrible movie

 Journey to the center of immorality

 A pointless and crass film.

 5 Oscars? are you kidding me?

 Just another penny stock.

 No need to show kids not to do!

 Pure junk, just like what these guys sold!
