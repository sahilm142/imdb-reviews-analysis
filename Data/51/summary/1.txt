 Like An Ipod on Shuffle But only containing 6 songs playing for 2 hours

 Forget about it!

 A monumentally over-rated wankfest.

 substantially unrealistic

 Mass hysteria?

 What's so great about THIS?

 Rated 10th best overall? Is this a joke?

 Pretentious dreck

 Note to self:

 Not so much a movie as an intellectual display...Films should be made for audiences, not for filmmakers

 Memento or how to make an insipid story seem intricate

 You Have GOT to Be Kidding Me!

 Interesting, but ultimately bad. Way overrated

 One big gimmick

 It's a gimmick but who cares !?

 Most over rated movie ever.

 Totally pretentious bollocks

 Retro-segues camouflage an excruciatingly slow pace and overworked premise.

 "Fact may be Stranger than Fiction." (Part 2 of 2)

 Pass this one!

 Candidate for Worst Movie ever

 MEMENTO IS VERY VERY VERY OVERRATED

 the worst piece of a movie... disgusted.

 The whole film is based on a gimmick and is overrated

 Where's the suspense?
