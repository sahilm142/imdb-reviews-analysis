 Trois couleurs: Rouge

 Three Colors Red: Subspense in Kieslowski

 The Pinnacle

 What is red about in 2 words

 Possibly the best in the trilogy

 Absolutely beautiful and the best of three.

 The last and the best...

 "Poetic, existentialistic and masterful..."

 Human Nature and Justice

 Well produced world cinema - if a little slow and deliberate.

 The second best of the trilogy

 Subtle

 Less Is More

 The most thematically satisfying of the Colors Trilogy

 Good drama with some mystery (or maybe symbolic mystery)
