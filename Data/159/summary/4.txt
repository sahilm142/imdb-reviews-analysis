 Great Movies have endings

 Gimme back that Oscar!!!

 Utterly Disappointing!

 One of the weakest among brilliant Coen films

 The Emperor's New Clothes

 Umm, a conclusion would be nice

 Where is the rest of it?

 ALMOST one of the best movies ever made.

 What was the ending all about?

 A wandering plot and tragic waste of talent

 Would you be satisfied with a half cooked burger? No? Read on...

 What were they thinking

 Too philosophical

 Not a total disaster !!

 No film for young men

 Waste of Time

 I think the director called tails.............

 More hokum from the Coen Brothers

 Was it any good?

 Gratuitous violence served with a watery philosophical sauce

 Promising start - but ultimately disappointing

 Criminally unsatisfying

 sheer pornography and some boring speech

 Cynical and pretentious

 I didn't like it (again)
