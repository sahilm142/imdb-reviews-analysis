This series isn't comedy or isn't comedy in a way like Seinfeld is comedy. This is depressing drama with dysfunctional characters where comedy comes to you as feeling sorry for characters being molested psychically by other characters in a "wtf did you expect from him/her?" way. So if you like to watch dysfunctional family and find their arguments and insecurities funny, you will be amused. But for me that's no comedy, not even in same universe as comedy. And about reviews here, like in most situations in 'merica today, those are fake in a way that people giving high scores to his series are those who will admire texture, presentation and feeling of eating the dish rather the ones who admire tastefulness and portion of the dish. And 8,9/10? C mon, more like 4/10 for drama.
