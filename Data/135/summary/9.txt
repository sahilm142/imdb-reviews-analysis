 Another wonderful movie from Miyazaki

 They tried to save each other ...

 A poetic anti-war cartoon.

 Wow, excellent!

 Many Parallels with Spirited Away

 Amazing, yet it moves forward to fast.

 Wow!

 Outstanding! One of Miyazaki's Best.

 An amazing animated film

 Totally Engrossing: If you liked Sprited Away, you'll love this!

 A marvelous, charming world

 Beautiful. Just Beautiful.

 Howl's Flying Castle is magically ephemeral with heart

 Howl's Moving Castle is an imaginative and delightful Miyazaki film

 One of Ghibli's best!

 I was so happy when i saw it.

 An epic adventure of love, courage, and confidence.

 Beautifully rich with imagination

 Beautiful and touching!

 Like any Miyazaki film, this is another great movie

 Better than Spirited Away

 Its Zen and beautiful

 Another classic from Studio Ghibli
