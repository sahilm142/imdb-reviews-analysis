I really was looking forward to this film. I even kept my expectations high for it when I saw it. Actually I was waiting for some action all the way through the whole movie until... until it suddenly ended! Yepp it just ended... before it even got started... It's a real petty, 'cause it could have been great... But the only feeling I had afterward was... was... eeh... Hmmm... Come to think of it I didn't feel anything, at least not concerning the movie cause I had already forgotten about it...No... Go see Shrek another time instead if you want to enjoy some pure comedy!


                
Strictly for kids and parents of kids. I was expecting more. It was cute but I need more from a Disney movie. I really don't see why that many people went to see it. It was probably due to the 'blair witch' marketing effect and that they played it in more theaters. Or maybe people are just desperate for a new disney cartoon. Let's face it, 'Shrek' was better.


                
"Shrek" was for adults, there is no doubt. This is closer to "Toy Story" in feel. It has a warmth and charm at it's core. Having said that, there is plenty for adults to enjoy. The voices are all fine, although it would have been nice for Buscemi to have had more to do. The plot is good, and the duration perfect.
