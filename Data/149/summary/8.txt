 An terrific film

 A heartbreaking expose of society

 A baroque masterpiece

 Lynch's most comprehensible film that I have ever seen

 A Moving Story

 Keep in faith and try hard to be a better man

 One of the most painful and dark movies ever made..

 It is NOT the "true" story of the elephant man

 The 3 "S" that damaged the story: Sentimentalism, Symbolism and Simplification ...

 A poignant and empowering biography.

 Dark... so very dark

 I am a human being!

 a sad story that unfortunately was real.

 A Tragic True Story, Masterfully Told

 One of Us.

 an absolutely wonderful and symbolic film

 Classic in many ways

 Sad and gripping

 John Merrick's struggle for dignity

 Mesmerizingly beautiful!

 I am not an animal...I am a great film!

 Amazing.

 Good Movie

 Humanizing the Elephant Man

 I'm a monster..and you?
