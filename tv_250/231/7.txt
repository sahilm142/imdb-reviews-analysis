Is it the idea itself? Why doing a TV show to which we all know the ending? Or is ot the feeling that "I have something like that a hundred times"? The first two episodes are great. Then the show only focuses on the trial itself. I asked my wife to watch this show with me and she refused. Cuba Gooding Jr does not look at all like the real OJ Simpson. But he does not look having spend time in prison. All the actors are good. Each Travolta appearance transcends the show. He is perhaps the main reason to watch the show which looks like a better but longer version of a "Good Wife" episode. At the end, it is such a sad story. How media can pressure on justice and public opinion wins. If an OJ Simpson case would take place today in 2017, would it end up the same way?
