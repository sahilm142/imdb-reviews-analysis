 So very, very boring.

 What a let down

 Visionary but flat

 Muddled Sci - Fi Rubbish

 Highly not recommended!

 Boring!!!!

 I personally HATED this film!!

 Artsy fartsy movie - plots deeper on star trek

 All form, little substance

 Yawn, is it over yet?

 I have tried....

 A grossly overrated film

 One-Line Review: Blade Runner (2 Stars)

 Most overrated movie of all time

 The Most Overrated Film I Have Ever Seen in My Life

 Sorry, but I hated it.

 WOW, that was.... bad

 soooo sloooow

 What a disappointment

 What??

 There were no children in this movie

 What a waste of time...

 F**king waste of time

 A complete waste of time and effort.

 Maybe in 1982 this was considered good sci-fi
