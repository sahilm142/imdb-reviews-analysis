 Boring...

 Vastly overrated

 The Most Over-Rated Show I Have Ever Seen

 Really Boring

 Breaking bad is a depressing sad TV show

 Most Overrated TV Show I've ever seen

 I am sure I am in the minority, but,

 Addictive, but far from perfect...jeez people.

 Unbelievable Bad show (with a capital B). Do not waste your time on this crap.

 Breaking Bad is certainly the most overrrated show out there
