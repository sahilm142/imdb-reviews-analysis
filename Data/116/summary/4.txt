 Worth the US$5.25

 No, No, No, No, and No!

 Batman for the Coldplay generation.

 A jumble of groovy scenes

 Ovrrated

 batman begins- based on a true story

 Great Concepts, Poor Execution

 Dull, except for the horrifically bad dialog

 High budget movie with a colossal waste of talent

 Didn't I See This Before?

 Not as good as Tim Burton's

 Batman Begins after 1 hour

 What a snoozer.............

 Competent... and utterly boring.

 Batman gets his wings clipped

 A horrible portray of Batman.

 Did I see the same film?

 Batman clearly begins, but doesn't get going.

 Batman Bile

 the real beginning

 wasn't it wrong??

 Neo where are you?

 Very average Hollywood action flick...

 this movie was painful to watch

 Total Crap!
