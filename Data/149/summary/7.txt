 Great Film-making, Problematic Treatment of John Merrick

 Very good and almost universally misunderstood.

 Troubling and moving

 Touching

 The Killing of the Unicorn

 Somber, graceful, eloquent--if not always moving

 the film teaches you about humanity

 Exquisitely crafted, but emotionally simplistic.

 A touching and depressive story

 An elephant inside all

 Above average movie with an exceptional performance and make-up

 We the Victorians

 A well constructed movie but not as good and interesting as Joseph Merrick's real life-story.

 The film is factually incorrect

 Good film, but not without flaws

 Nice story, but it could have been nicer.

 good but not great

 A typical David Lynch Tale
