 One of the finest portrayals of loneliness

 A crazed Robert DeNiro undergoes a criminal rampage when his dreams fail

 Is this worth seeing?

 Very good but flawed

 On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody...

 Goodness me, how movies can change over time

 Travis the Trainwreck?

 A very good character study about loneliness in urban society

 A haunting portrayal of loneliness and insanity

 We never learn much about Travis Bickle, yet the talent involved makes him a compelling figure

 Rated R film from the 70s

 A Cult Classic

 Impressive but not amazing

 Taxi Driver

 DiNero created a cinematic hero out for a city that tosses him rightfully aside

 Memorable Feel Bad Film

 just a few minutes too long.....

 A gritty new York film buoyed by De Niro's amazing performance

 Nowhere as good as it is made out to be but a must watch regardless

 Tough story to get though, but a great film

 Not Scorsese's Best, although the Performances are Outstanding,
