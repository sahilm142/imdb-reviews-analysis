 Well-made but that's about it.

 Let me explain my stance on this film:

 A Haunting movie

 Disappointingly conventional

 2 hours that will pass by with no great meaning or originality.

 The Oscar Hype May Give Unrealistic Expectatations

 Solid performances mostly help overcome film's shortcomings

 The best of it's genre!

 Some great acting and a harrowing tale, with a very touching finale, but something doesn't quite click, leaving you feeling a little numb after

 Powerful, Not Emotional

 Disappointing

 Brace Yourselves - The Awards Are Coming!

 Good film but not the Best Picture of 2013

 An Emotionally Draining and Thought-Provoking Cinematic Event

 Good movie BUT.....

 Bludgeoning drama

 Could Be A Hell of a Lot Worse

 The worst title for a movie

 A Brutally Realistic Piece

 Pretty good but mediocre directorship in some scenes

 The Vidiot Reviews

 I hated this movie.

 Good Movie but could have been better

 A harrowing story of a free man made slave

 Great performances and directing, moralizing plot
