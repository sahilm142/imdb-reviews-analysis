 About the beautiful series Babylon Berlin

 Review with some background information

 Technical Gem

 At LEAST a nine.

 Most excellent!!!

 Like having a ticket on the Titanic...

 Absolutely outstanding series.

 One beautiful show almost ruined by bad sub titles and English dubbing

 Solid 9

 Hold On

 Tom Tykwers series debut - successfuly handeld

 Worth it for the music and club scenes alone.

 Very, very classy!

 Fantastic show

 Excellent Series

 Clearly one of the BEST on TV - But who directed the second finale?
