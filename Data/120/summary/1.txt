 Not Das Boot

 Der Untergang

 More of the same lies and comedy

 just a senseless, expensive absurdity

 A Flattering Portrait Of An Evil Regime

 An utterly unimaginative recreation of facts everyone knows already

 Dangerous and uninteresting

 propaganda for "good Nazis"

 terribly boring

 Not every Hitler or WO II movie is good or touching

 Completely Overrated

 This movie is really awful

 The Downfall is the movie itself!

 Simply uninteresting.

 The worst film I've ever seen

 A scandalous piece
