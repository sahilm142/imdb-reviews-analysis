Okay, so maybe I'll get hated for the rest of my life for writing this. But at least I'll get to have my say.There are just so many problems with this show--I can't believe I watched it all the way through when I was a little kid, and actually liked it. I recently watched a few episodes again, and felt that I needed to write this review.The one thing that I won't complain about is the animation, because even though it's really bad at the start of the series; it gets better towards the end.Dragonball Z seems to have filler in just about every saga. The obvious example that seems to be cited everywhere I've looked seems to be when Frieza destroyed the planet Namek--but the example I'll draw attention to is that at one stage, Goten and Kid Trunks were training in that Time Vault thing, and they sent their Kamehameha blasts at each other. While it could have lasted less than five minutes; the writers of the show evidently felt it was necessary to extend it out for an entire episode.In my personal opinion, the characters tended to be on the annoying side of the scale. Yes, I understand it's just a kid's show and all characters in kid's shows are supposed to be a bit annoying--but most are considerably less annoying than this.If it weren't for the annoying characters and large amounts of filler; I could imagine myself liking this show. It's just too bad that they had to wreck it: the animation in some of the later episodes is good, and it deals with some rather interesting concepts.3/10
