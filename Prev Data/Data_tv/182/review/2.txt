The series started of slow and struggling and was a pain to watch. Then it got better - the story started to get interesting and the characters improved. I started to care about them and began to enjoy the series.Then it got bad again. The characters degenerated - they became caricatures of some crazy mean people. Characters mumbled out stories that dragged on into "something profound". Lots of broken and bad people with nothing really interesting about them. You kept waiting hopefully for something to happen - anything! But besides long monologues that rambled on nothing much did.Then things started happening - and it got worse. The ending couple of series was _the_ pits! I don't get it - who enjoys watching a pitiful man break down? Flashbacks of some pre-feminist wife beating, child abandoning sh*t? Is this entertainment?! Some "statement on life" nonsense? Man - if you like this stuff you've gotta get a life...
I tried to watch this, I really did. I wanted to like it. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the stars in this show. But that pleasant surprise turned to disappointment when we saw how bad the acting and directing were. It was like they not even didn't know their lines but that hadn't read the script before and like there wasn't even a rehearsal. It was like the actors have never met before and were thrown into this. When the show started and the set appeared, I commented that it looks like "Cheers"...If only. I'll admit that we will usually give a show a few episodes to see the characters develop but this was not even mediocre acting. These actors are far better than the "I'll take the paycheck" job that they did on this.
