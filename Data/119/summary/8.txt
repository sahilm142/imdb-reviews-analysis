 A classic feel of Western with the added brilliance of Clint Eastwood and an equally strong cast

 'A Man With No Name' Becomes 'A Man With A Real Story'.

 The Good, the Bad and the Unforgiven...

 The cause deserves attention.

 Three Charismatic Actors Elevate Hard-Edged Western

 It is unforgiven if you haven't saw this movie yet

 Clint again making magic in screen

 A modern classic

 Fascinating bunch of characters makes this Western stand out

 Terrific western - Eastwood excels

 Excellent movie

 What's to forgive?

 Unforgiven is an unforgettable Movie

 the last western you ever need to see

 A real western that is anti-western at the same time.

 About as good as I thought it would be

 Trying to say something

 The perfect western

 The best (anti) western movie

 Outstanding.

 Is this a story about Avenging a Wrong or about Murder as an Addictive Behavior?

 Great movie but a little overrated..

 Mature western

 Clint gives the Western the send-off it deserves

 Well worth a watch if you are a Western, or a Clint fan.
