 Weak rehash of old material

 I Kept Thinking it would Get Better and I was Missing Something

 Definitely for the under-12's

 What a complete waste time and life

 What's The Point ?

 Close but no Cigar

 Another pointless, terrible show that everyone loves.

 Mediocre Netflix Unoriginal Series

 So childish and utterly boring

 I liked it better when it was called ''Door to December'' by Dean Koontz

 golden globe nominee

 Show keeps baiting you to watch the next episode, but fails

 Utter trash - not scary and full of bad acting

 A kids stories for kids, played by kids, directed by kids?

 Clichéd. Generic. Unimaginative.

 Deserves a 6star at most

 Asinine

 Awful

 Is not for people older than 22, definitely

 Awful

 Overhyped and Bad

 ### One of the worst cocktail TV series ever ###

 Trite plot, poor acting and even poorer logic

 Not Really Original

 I wanted to love this
