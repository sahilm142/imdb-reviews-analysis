 The Equal Screen Time Ruined This Film

 Poor

 Fantastic true-story, lousy movie

 One Spielberg will want to forget

 Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.

 Will Spielberg ever Direct another Classic?

 Poorly paced but in places enjoyable

 Catch Me Not

 Main character inspires no empathy & no condemnation

 way too little

 fun but flaky

 Ehh.
