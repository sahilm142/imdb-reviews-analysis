 Prettied up, lots of familiar twists, but well done, surely, and with Nicholson in top top form

 Quite good, but over-rated seems like......

 The ending killed it for me

 I don't embrace all the high praise for "Chinatown."

 Great noir

 Not for me, but if you're into 70s and noir, you'll really like it

 A good private eye film, even if too long and overpraised

 Very good, but not excellent

 Oscar, BAFTA's, worth while and rewarding

 Cleverly woven tale

 very good film, superb score

 Enjoyable

 Downtown in Chinatown

 Welcome in the seventies, Film noir

 Overrated Screenplay

 Good Movie. I feel it is overrated.

 Reputation outlived the replay...

 Chinatown - My Review

 Classic neo-noir

 "You can't eat the Venetian blinds. I just had them installed on Wednesday."

 Hardboiled crime, just the way I like it

 Great film-making with some flaws

 Well knit thriller

 "Forget it, Rick; It's 2019."

 Feel strongly then do something!
