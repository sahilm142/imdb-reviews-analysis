 A masterpiece of early cinema....

 The American comic tradition

 Our (cinematic) World needs more Chaplins.

 Terrifically funny and original, even now. A small wonder.

 One of Chaplin's Best

 As fresh, funny, and moving as the day it was made.

 Funny and a real classic

 Did you know shoes taste delicious?

 Comedy gold

 Entertaining

 Amazing Chaplin Delivers

 Another Great movie by Charlie Chaplin

 The Gold Rush

 I think I've struck gold...

 My college class MADE me watch this movie...

 Chaplin Does An About Face In The Gold Rush

 Most enjoyable in it's original silent form.

 Essential Little Tramp

 A great, comedic gem. The best Chaplin there is.

 Lovely movie

 Chaplin's Snowbound Comedy.

 'The Gold Rush' still amazes and succeeds in comedic performance, and embodies pioneering cinema!

 An excellent example of a lost genre

 Splendid Comedy
