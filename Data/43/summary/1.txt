 Loved it as a kid, Hate it now, Here's why.

 A movie for people who say "awesome" a lot....

 Oh dear.

 Not worth watching

 Look past the crappy characters and you'll find some candy

 A rather boring hi tech special effects fest

 just another Hollywood explosion movie

 One of my personal least favorites of all time

 Worst sequel ever!

 STUPID

 Nothing likable about this movie at all

 *

 Another annoying Hollywood shoot 'em up

 Rubbish
