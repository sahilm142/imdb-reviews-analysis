 Best film ever? You must be batty!

 Not impressed

 Gimme A Break

 Dark and Dreary

 Not Very Good

 If this is as great as everyone tells me, why do so many people agree with my criticisms!

 My, oh my...

 Boring

 Fight Club for stupid people

 Doesn't Live Up To the Hype.

 Nothing really new, but still a solid comic movie

 Critic and crowd pleaser raucously uninspiring

 I guess it had its moments

 Overrated...not Batman

 just read.

 Really doesn't know what it wants to be.......

 I Turned It Off With 25 Minutes To Go

 Why the big deal?

 Too Long, Too Little in Spite of Heath Ledger's Brilliant Performance

 Dark? As dark as high noon on a summer's day

 One of the worst Batman films

 a good attempt but no cigar

 a lot of screaming does not make a good story

 I actually didn't enjoy this movie as so many people have

 boe_dye sez: Surprisingly, this is more like Batman 2.5
