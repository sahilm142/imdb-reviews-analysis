I've waited patiently until the conclusion of TLOK to finally write this review. I am huge fan of ATLA<U+0085>in fact I feel it is one of the best animated series out there and give it a solid 10/10. From the very first episode you are drawn into a world where the story telling and character development are top notch along with some well balanced humor and even a splash of romance. We were able to not only see but also feel the struggles the characters faced and how it changed them. It was a unique series that despite being made for children, appealed greatly to adults as well. Now, let's get back to TLOK.I thought the first season was okay, but it had promise. I didn't like all of the characters and the pro bending stuff wasn't my cup of tea, but hey<U+0085>it was more Avatar! However after this the show just continued to get worse<U+0085>with some exceptions being the Avatar Wan episodes which were simply incredible – in my opinion on par with some of the best ATLA episodes. But despite a few decent episodes this show just kept missing the mark and then concluded with a lackluster ending that was unfortunately a fitting end to this poorly written series.I always think back to the very first episode of ATLA where Zuko states "You're the airbender? You're the Avatar?" which still gives me goosebumps as I sit here writing about it! It grabbed you in the gut, made you pay attention and care about the characters. ATLA did this masterfully with almost every episode. TLOK failed at this miserably with very, very few exceptions.Gripes That Ruined This Show: 1) The Radio Announcer: Holy hell was this guy annoying! He needed to die.2) Love Triangles: TLOK uses this to the extreme and I mostly blame the idiot fans for this. Any one out there ever been in a real life love triangle? I have<U+0085>and they are not fun at all<U+0085>in fact they destroy people's lives. Hands down, the most stupid and overused plot device in modern storytelling.3) Cookie Cutter Villains: Every season of LOK revolves a megalomaniac villain who wants to take over the world and preach their drivel to the masses. Amon was pretty good<U+0085>but each season we get the same type of evil nut job<U+0085>same crap, same story. No new ground broken here...lazy writing at its worst!4) Prejudice against the old characters. We get a little tease of them, but now they are all mostly old and feeble. I guess King Bumi was an exception? But my biggest complaint about this show is that while the premise was that it was "more adult oriented" the show ends up taking a huge step backwards into kiddie land. If you actually compare the two series<U+0085>look closely at how many silly over the top characters are in TLOK<U+0085>and then look at the more serious tone of ATLA. Let me explain further.At first I liked the fact that the creators were not afraid to jump 70 years into the future<U+0085>however they didn't really change anything. We have two annoying animals to replace Appa and Momo and they are p!ss poor replacements at best. And then there is a fatal overdose of what I call The Sokka Factor. Sokka's antics were silly and at times annoying<U+0085>yet his character evolved and he got serious when called to action. If you really wanted a more grown up show<U+0085>how about leaving this silly humor OUT OF THE NEW SERIES? Well the opposite happens because the writers dump on it us by the truckload!This brings me to Bolin's character, who along with his wooden brother Mako were both a complete waste of animation and provided nothing new or interesting to the series. I watched the entire first two seasons several times before I actually memorized their names. This is a testament to how worthless I found them and how little I cared for their characters. Bolin's character continues to get more and more stupid and annoying<U+0085>and then is joined by Bumi, Varrick and finally the most worthless character in the entire Avatar Universe, Prince Wu. This diarrhea overload of silly Jar-Jar Binks "humor" got so bad that I started counting how many minutes of each episode were devoted to these idiotic characters spouting off their stupidity and waving their arms around. I could almost see the writers in a room with a bunch of storyboards: "OK we start this episode with a little serious story telling to tease the audience<U+0085>and then BRING ON THE SOKKA! More silliness! Get him on the soapbox waving his arms and being SILLY! The kids love this crap, goddammit! OK, then we have another 2-3 minutes of some personal struggle of Korra's<U+0085>wait not too much since we want to save the big reveal about Zuko/Toph or anything intelligent fans might actually care about for the next episode<U+0085>and then GIVE ME MORE SILLY SOKKA!" o_OJust watch how much screen time, especially in season 4 is given to this drivel. It's such a damn shame. Made for adults my ass!And as a final insult, we get a ridiculous "Dumbledore is gay" ending. Fan pandering at its finest! To the writers and creators of this show<U+0085>you had us by our heart strings with ATLA<U+0085>you really did. Then you allowed that horrible movie to be made. And then this crappy series. I'm extending my middle finger at my screen and THIS IS FOR YOU and all your stupid fans who actually supported this insipid drivel! In conclusion I can best sum up the failure of The Legend of Korra and the future of this franchise by providing a movie quote spoken by Mako himself:"Success can test one's mettle as surely as the strongest adversary".Case closed.
Without going at lengths through the accomplishments of the spiritual forefather of this series, let it be noted that A:TLA revolutionized the animated series scene when it came out, a testament to the power of higher-quality animation and good writing. With that in mind, a sequel, with the same people at helm, was a thrilling prospect.Up until coming face to face with the creation, that is. LoK borrows many elements from A:TLA, and could have conceivably done a fairly good job of preserving the central aspects of the A:TLA universe while tweaking it for a new audience. Instead, the fans of the original were pelted with, metaphorical, dung pies all the way from the title character mastering three of the four elements by age four to the awful, contrived ending where the casual viewer was berated for wearing hetero lenses when the romance took an unexpected turn.The show as a whole undermines the notion of an Avatar, reduces what have been beloved characters to mere jokes and has the audacity to pat itself on the back for destroying the legacy left behind by Aang and co. What is the point of the Avatar training and going around the world when Korra Sue can bend three elements by age four? What is so great about Iroh entering the spirit world when there is an accessible portal through which most anyone can pass? Why is the Avatar in any way special when the Turtles might have bestowed their powers upon any other mortal who would then go on to fuse with Raava? The answers can only be the following: none, nothing and he/she isn't.I suppose they tried re-framing the origins and demystifying the concept of Avatar, but Bryke seem to have overlooked that half the fun is in the mystery.From a technical standpoint, the animation is of good quality and the music likewise contributes to the atmosphere. But these factors can only do so much. One needs a good story to work with. Which story is not to be found here.If one watches the series without a single iota of an expectation, then it will surely please. For those of us expecting more than a pretty picture , however, it will likely leave a sour aftertaste, be advised when choosing to watch this.3/10 is the score I give it, and those three points go to animation and music, and nothing else besides.
(Note) this review is based largely on the first series, the second is slightly more tolerable but still didn't hook me enough to watch more than the first six episodes.Avatar: The Legend of Korra is not without its positives. The need to differentiate itself from its predecessor goes without saying and the steam punk setting is interesting, blending modern sensibilities with themes like industrial expansion and political revolution. The summaries of the episodes, told in a sepia old-movie style with a posh British commentator are genuinely exciting and the music is jazzy and upbeat. However, there is little else of merit in this deeply flawed re- imagination of the Avatar universe.The opening credits of The Last Airbender were narrated enthusiastically by Katara, they created anticipation. J.K. Simmons, who can be interesting, is positively lack-luster by comparison. And Tenzin, whilst delivering the odd amusing line or gesture, is just boring. Korra too is unlikable. Of course she has to be different to Aang but she is constantly whining and very hard to sympathise with as a result. The inevitable romantic sub-plot is not believable, how does anyone fall for someone so mopey? Bolin is a failed attempt to recreate Sakka in that he isn't particularly funny and Mako is too serious. In its rush to create an extravagant plot, it forgets character development, which was what underpinned The Last Airbender - Zuko being the greatest example in his defection from the Fire Nation.Throughout, the question is raised: how can stoic and bland Tenzin even be related to the playful and interesting Aang? It is answered in a flashback where Aang is depicted, astonishingly, as not only weak but as a dull character, telling Toph to stop calling him nicknames, something that the old Aang would never have done. Not even with the additional and strenuous pressure of uniting the land. Being the Avatar is no longer a privilege, it is just a title, a word even and though this may make it seem grittier, it has no more relevance than, for example, Useful Pro-Bending Player: The Legend of Korra. The frequent use of blood-bending is very problematic, as it was symbolic of human depravity before, it was a moral issue, could a person ever stoop so low as to physically control another human? Could it ever be right? Now, it is used flippantly and its gravitas is diminished. Similarly with the ability bestowed upon the avatar to remove bending, another moral issue, born out of Aang's desperation not to end the Fire Lord's life and supposedly only possible for the pure of spirit. Again, tossed around trivially until it loses its meaning.To see people comparing The Legend of Korra and The Last Airbender in the same breath is staggering. Korra's adventures seem to try their very best to trample over and defile the memories of Aang and it is a real, real shame. As a stand-alone series, it might be passable but it is impossible to ignore comparisons between the two. It could have been so much more but it just leaves a bitter taste in the mouth and is a dip back into the Avatar universe that ultimately should not have been taken.


                
I really have no words to justify 'The Legend of Korra', only that it is just a huge waste of your precious time. This is mostly a hate comment by the way and therefore it has only some MINOR SPOILERS. For more depth I recommend to watch the video's of E;R on YouTube, because I have pretty much the same opinion as well and I think he explains his very accurate. You probably wasting your time reading this review, so I like to start with the conclusion first. The Legend of Korra is a huge insult to arguably the best animated TV series ever made by telling an extremely poor written sequel with almost no character development. So if you are that person who are looking for a series with a bit of the same intelligence like the original ATLA, then I suggest you avoid this "Legend of Korra" at any costs(I am probably too late with this), because it only triggers the hype-button, nothing more. I stuck around only the first season of this series, because the concept of the story was not ALL that terrible, however in the end of season 1 they managed to mess things anyway... The amount of plot holes in that episode became so spontaneously big, that I could not stand it much longer, so eventually I quit watching it. Now for the long version...First I want to tell that Avatar The Legend of Aang is for me the best animated TV series by choice. However, this sequel, with its own level of logic, plots, character development, scripts, and so on and so on... well it does not reach even close to the original(typical for sequels nowadays). I can't even find the connection in this show with ATLA and that is because of all the in-corrections in the history of the ATLA. Did Michael and Bryan ever watched their previous show?! Also 'Respect' is so hard to find in TLOK, that it is like finding a Siberian Tiger in your own backyard. Respect and discipline were always the important factors of learning a new element. Speaking of elements, I can't believe that Korra can already control three elements from the start of the show(I simply can't believe that this was just approved), even though they are living in a time of peace. Now Aang managed to control the other three elements just in a couple of months at the age of twelve, but even at his age(12) that is almost impossible. Now we see that Korra can bend 3 elements at the age of 4, but how?! She is after all not a disciplined character to say the least unlike Aang. I just can't find any logic in this element-bending system.I also can not find any adult-thinking characters in this series(which supposed to be more mature). The moments that made me cringe are countless, especially all those awkward dialogues with the endless stupidity of the main characters. Bolin is at the top of that list. Bolin is probably meant to be the "Sokka" character in the story. However he does not have the intelligence nor the humor to make him even act a bit like Sokka. Humor was not what made Sokka so successful as a character, it is about the contrast with the comedy he brought and his mature act in the group. He wants to be a leader and he wants to help and he got things done with his creative idea's even though he is a non-bender all along. Bolin on the other hand is just acting dumb in order to be funny and that is by far not enough to built up his "character". As for Korra, the creators really made it hard to make Korra's character likable. Korra is a rash, arrogant and sensitive character with a small amount of patience and I am completely fine with that. Her personality also kinda reminds me of Po from 'Kung Fu Panda'. Po also has a rash character, with a dream of becoming a legendary warrior. He showed off in front of the furious five hoping to pass the test in their presence and even impress them. He failed the test and he felt like a loser that he will never become a true Kung Fu Warrior. This setup worked because we saw the character of Po change by taking away the hopes of the main character. This gives us the opportunity to sympathize with them and there is no single time in The Legend of Korra that gave that opportunity for well almost every character actually. Korra still remain the same rash, sensitive, arrogant character like in the beginning, who still letting people do stuff for her, because she is the avatar.There is simply nothing in this show that gave more value to the avatar universe. In fact it is rather destroying it and the more I think about it, the more I believe that this is not a coincidence.
I absolutely loved the original series; however, I found this new series to be seriously lacking in substance, and thus extremely disappointing. The show is obviously aimed at teenage audiences, and thus has a lot of unnecessarily angsty romance that wasn't present (or at least more subtle) in the original series. Although the 'bad guys' in the series seem to have a valid cause, they are depicted as almost wholly evil. We don't get to know any of them personally, except the main villain, who is only shown in a sympathetic light once we learn that he's a bender. Most of the "bad guys" are faceless, generic goons, and show zero character development. In contrast, in the original series, we are shown the human side of the fire-nation; some members of the fire-nation are good, and even join the protagonists' side. Although the show's premise is interesting and has potential, the main characters are fairly two-dimensional and (in my opinion) not very likable -- especially Mako, who is basically a moody jerk, (unsuccessfully) played off as tormented and mysterious. All in all, definitely a downgrade from the original series. The writers took away any sort of deep meaning that was present in the first series for a short fandom-pleaser. The show also seems very rushed, as the creators only planned to make one series. I don't understand why it has such a high rating.


                
-Great but inconsistent artstyle.
-Interesting and educational but very poorly handled themes, with false, sometimes even morally wrong resolutions/quintessences.
-Major violation of various basic principles of fiction storywriting, and forced plots, resulting in a lot of bland exposition, poor conveying of important character motivation, and biased points of view. (The mystery is dispelled, as simple "magic" granted arbitrarily by gods.)
-Unnecessary and subjectively very bad chosen explanations for the world and its laws, sometimes in conflict with the original series (incosnsistent rules to bending and spirit realm, very flawed origin story, technological bs).
-dumbed down, two dimensional and stereotypical characters with little to no (or just the pretense of) developement. Especially the unintellectual, tantrum throwing bully protagonist with anger issues, who gets everything handed on a silver platter and never really has to deal with the consequences. (And if it happens, it isn't shown). And the beloved Characters and their legacy from the original series are handled despicably.
-Comedy theatrics are obnoxious and often out of place.
-The world of charming traditional asian cultures from the original series were discarded for a cold, western steampunk setting, which gives the series a totally different feel, and imo not for the better.All in all, it's avatar, but with less of most what made the original series great, unnecessary additions, and a sour aftertaste.


                
Let's get started!Animation: Clearly the main selling point to this series! Some time and effort has been devoted to make this a huge step-up from its' predecessor, for the visuals, at least. The fights are well choreographed and nothing short of awesome at times, but somewhat lacking in subtlety and thought in favor of bigger and flashier effects. All in all a job well done.Setting: It doesn't swing well with me to be honest. After reviewing the second season (the one with the avatar wan flashback), it strikes me as odd that the world seemingly doesn't evolve in either technology or society in several thousand years yet is pushed past electrification and democracy in a mere 70 years with no apparent struggle or explanation. TLOK loses more than just a few points from this, because it severely lacks the charm and appeal so evident in the setting of ATLA. The focus on one rather uninspired and underdeveloped town rather than the whole world and its' struggles doesn't do it any good, either.Writing: And here it begins to fall apart! The massive changes in the writing staff from ATLA is perhaps the biggest flaw in the whole series. Every clichéd development you can possibly imagine IS USED in the TLOK, and to such extremes that you could actually guess the outcome of an episode if you are presented with all the troubles the characters get into, usually after three to five minutes. The problems don't stop there: Protagonist struggles-> gets its butt kicked by villain-> struggles some more-> seeks guidance-> gets its butt kicked some more only to be rescued in an almost embarrassingly stupid and obvious deus ex machina event is NOT what an intelligent viewer expects from a sequel said to be written "with a more mature audience in mind", and that's the set-up for all the seasons! Mix it up with teenage angst and excruciatingly trivial relationship problems, paired with grown- ups daddy or mommy issues and their ongoing futile struggles to resolve them for no apparent reason (Toph and Lin's meet-up, as well as Tensing taking a hike with his siblings were almost unbearable to watch), and you get an godawful mess of a plot, that only has to maintain until the inevitable big fight without any variation, but fails to deliver even that.Characters: It gets worse! None, and I really mean NONE, of the protagonists are relatable in the slightest. No motivation, purpose or goal, other than to drive the questionable plot forward is apparent in any of them. The avatar is a sad excuse for one, struggling more with herself and her issues than with the problems at hand and actually seems to get weaker and more pathetic as the series continues. Her sidekicks are either useless and wooden (Mako and Tensin, who fall short in their given roles, fighter/boyfriend and mentor, almost completely), or cringe- inducing goofy (Bolin and Varak, comic relief without comic or relief), or sadly underdeveloped (Azami, the only pale light in the whole cast). Some characters, especially Su Beifong and her family, are so utterly without value and purpose that they seem to lack any justification for their continued appearances in the story, while the antagonists are by far the most interesting characters, with actual, somewhat believable backstories, while still being painfully underdeveloped. I'd certainly like to see a spin-off with Zahir and his merry crew, based mainly on fighting and the philosophy of the red lotus, it couldn't be worse than this drivel! Character development doesn't take place at all, apart from Korra's sexual orientation, which was an rather obvious and sad move from the writers to get some attention back to their failed project. If they really cared about that they would have started the season with the change, not finished with it.Summary: Animation: 6/10Setting: 4/10Writing: 2/10Characters: 0/10 Overall: 3/10
This is my summary of things after watching the first season:Great idea and concept! Poor delivery. Spent too much time on the Pro-bending tournament and pointless romance, which took away from the main plot and character development. Shallow characters, average fight scenes and all in all lacking in the ingenuity that the previous avatar series had. I wish they'd just halve the number of episodes because it was slow at the beginning and then rushed towards the end.On a side note: The air-bender outfit works for kids, not adults(Tenzin or dead Aang). Korra always gets her way and way too easily. I was glad she lost her powers. I thought, "Finally, now we're getting somewhere." It would teach her a thing or two about storming into a powerful enemy's territory without a plan let alone a backup plan. Is common sense such a rare thing to come by? Getting her powers back by shedding a single tear, defeating a powerful enemy so easily, stealing Mako away from Asami; I can't say I'm emotionally invested in this one.
I'm really disappointed. I guess I just had high expectations after watching the very first Avatar which I absolutely loved. This one fell short for me. I was so excited for this new avatar but I didn't like the whole overall story. I really tried to like it but I just, didn't. Now this is my personal opinion but I also did not like how they basically tried to make Korra a lesbian, I mean really? Isn't this a network for kids? I just didn't like the direction the creators were trying to go with her. I know what you're going to say I'm a bigot but whatever, it doesn't belong on a kids show.Sadly, I'm just going to watch all the old re-runs of Aang and the gang (bought all the DVDs) but other than that, they lost a follower in me.


                
I was really excited at first for a continue at the avatar universe, but unfortunately i wasn't happy about the results of this future avatar history. When you think about the story and the plot, it seems to be very reasonable to think about a revolution coming from the non-benders especially when this history takes part in a post war scenario. But when you Analise this whole new world you can notice somethings kind different about the benders from both Aang's season from Korra's season, the main difference that made me vote for 3/10 was that everybody magically everybody have a unusual bending for example Tarrlok can blood bend without full moon, he is only one of these case, and that is something that make the history to get lost inside the questions related about that unusual bending. But the reason I really hated this new Korra world was about the benders is a general talking, where are some good looking bending we all like, or the rough fights? Only some bad moves, and due to all this the huge battles didn't caught my view. I hope this review shows everybody why I rated 3/10 for "The Legend of Korra" (2012)".
The romance that Korra has with Mako, is horrible. First it's Mako with Asami Sato and then Mako with Korra, at the end of the day Mako stayed with Asami Sato. And the got kisses back and forth. Which makes Korra like she is sharing Mako with Asami. Like their is no respect in that relationship and the best part Korra didnt even care about it at the end. It look like a threesome. Not the best show for kids or teens. Meanwhile Avatar the last air bender was excellent in everything. I could go on with Korra and other dumb things the show has but I just stop watching it, I could not stand another episode.
The same as Voltron: Legendary Defender: didn't bother to develop interesting base characters, utilized annoying ones for garbage dialogue and those with the most potential were wasted eg. Noatak and Tarrlok wtf = Allura and Lance. You get strung along on an indecisive, emotional tantrum and it's all tidied up quickly with a shock value ending (very cowardly done considering the themes were introduced sooo late) that feels like some of the script has been cut off in the same style as one of the 'clash/wrath of the titans' movies. So many potentially awesome avenues and new ideas to explore were squandered in both T.V. shows. I've seen Big Ted, Little Ted and Jemima act out more interesting stories (with satisfying endings) whilst still leaving me baffled at the mystery of their interpersonal relationships. Big Ted is so strong, yet Little Ted is closer in size to Jemima... Do Teddy Bears even date Dolls?!?!?! No one ever actually defined the genders of the bears outside of the fictitious roles they play during story time. I still don't know! Play school ftw
