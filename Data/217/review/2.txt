I was disappointed to hear too much of background sound like, I just honestly couldn't concentrate on watching the film at all!If this wasn't an issue for me to look at the entire film, I would've probably give it 8 stars but unfortunately I just can't give it a non truthful result like really, they should really have done something about that.I've heard so much on this film of good reviews and websites that I just couldn't understand why it didn't click with me.I'm glad I just saw this for 30 minutes because I can't take no more of the background sound!
