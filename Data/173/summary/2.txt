 The opposite of art

 Pathetic excuse for a movie

 2 for the spectacular fights.

 terrible! very over rated

 Kill Bill:Vol.1

 I suppose I'm probably biased.

 I don't get it

 Shrill swill, nil skill, will still fill ill Kill Bill ...

 terrible

 Tarantino becomes P.T. Barnum

 A lod of self indulgent waffle.

 not the best action film

 WHY KILL BILL IS A BAD FILM

 I can only remember the swords...

 I'll give it 3 D's: Drawn out, Dreary, Disgusting.

 Crayola Havoc

 Overrated and disappointing garbage

 The 70's were bad enough the first time.

 some artistic merit ruined by excessive violence

 No, no, no, no and no.

 On October 10th...a Quest for Revenge is done over again

 honestly,i'm cool,see me reference hip stuff and call it a career

 Utter nonsense

 Vastly over-rated...

 Awful movie
