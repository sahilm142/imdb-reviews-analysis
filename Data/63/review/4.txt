Nothing much to say, really, about the animation. PIXAR steps it up another notch. Simply stunning, which is par for the course for PIXAR. I gave the film six stars and at least five of them go to the visuals.However, the story didn't really match those visuals. And the two robot leads were cute, I'll grant, but not much more than that.SPOILERS FOLLOW.Basically, humans created the mess that made it necessary for them to leave the planet. And we're supposed to root for them to come back? I'm sorry, I just don't get it. It's not a strong enough reason for me to root for the protagonists. And the antagonists are, likewise, not compelling enough, with no real apparent motivation for keeping the humans from re-inhabiting earth, unless it's to protect the earth from humans overloading the world with trash again, in which case, I'm not sure we shouldn't have rooted for them instead.And what about the other species? We see fish in the end credits. Presumably, the planet was okay for them and other species? The movie doesn't really go into that, unless I missed something.Meanwhile, while the humans were away, they came to rely on being carted around on hover-chairs. As the film explains, this leads to some bone loss. And their ability to walk has apparently atrophied over the centuries. Only it hasn't, as we see the uniformly obese humans learn to walk again, much like overgrown infants learn to walk. Perhaps this is meant to be symbolic, but it doesn't make a lot of logical sense.Finally, I'm not sure why a live action Fred Willard was used, but this is a minor point. Given the rest of the movie, I find that I really don't care. I just find it a little odd.
**SPOILERS BELOW** **SPOILERS BELOW**I suspect that someone created this gosh-darn-cute Wall-E character and that Disney/Pixar then got the bright idea to build an entire story around it. Unfortunately, they did great with the animation but forgot to include the, um, story part.The animation was certainly sophisticated--if you could stay interested long enough to appreciate it. The movie had a couple of good moments, but for those of you who didn't see it, let me summarize what you missed here, from the point where the two protagonists meet until the end of the movie:"Wall-e." "Eve." "Wall-e." "Eve." "E-ve?" "Eve." "Eve." "Wall-e." "Eve!" "Wall-e!" (bashful) "Eeeve" (giggle/demur) "Wall-e." (terror) "Eve!!" (sadness) "Eve." "Foreign Contaminant!" (anxious) "Eve! Eve!""Wall-e!!! (death's door) "Eve." "Foreign Contaminant!" (hopeful) "Wall-e?" (sad) "Wall-e..." "Eve?" "Wall-e? ....Wall-e!!" (BFF) "Eeeve." (BFF) "Waaall-ee."The End.Yep,that's right, this was the bulk of the dialog. For 1.5 hours...I guess I just needed--more.
Looking for a movie, that your kids will love and adore? Look no further. This'll do the trick. Looking, for something for the whole family? This movie fails. This movie could have been so much more! It could have easily been amongst PIXARs bravest and best! The story pitch really suggested that they were ready to try something new; something bold. Imagine:A love story between two robots. 'Real' robots, that is, without the physical human attributes found in other animation features like, well, 'Robots', set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic Earth.If one can accept that pre-programmed machines are able to feel love (and that concept was good enough for Kubrick!), this would truly be a movie for the grown ups, investigating that strange, obviously platonical romance between two 'artificials' (echoing the likes of 'Blade Runner'). Two man-made objects, seeking each others companionship in a desolate world of human remains. An idea of such fragile beauty, that one could throw in quite a lot of robo-stick comedy (you know, for the kids!), and still leave something for the everyone. Children wouldn't understand the haunting quality of a dusty wasteland, inexplicably void of people, nor would they get the love story; they'd just enjoy a robot falling on it's metal bum.It never became that movie. The end product abandons the pioneering spirit of the original idea, and the movie falls back on clichés, predictable gags and an eco-message so heavily stamped in our faces throughout the story, that it becomes borderline sickening, by the end of the film. The problems are obvious from the get-go: The visual design of WALL-E himself is annoying. He's mainly a dwarfed version of Johnny 5 from 'Short Circuit', with the big dark eyes from "Puss In Boots" ('Shrek 2'). The design reeks of "play it safe" producing: It's obvious that some producer "liked the wicked idea", and then demanded something that was a) done before b) something cute. WALL-E is cute; Cute as step-dancing penguins, another safe bet with an ego message.More annoyingly: this lonely robot is <U+0096> in fact <U+0096> not alone. A cockroach, has befriended him. It's called 'Cri-Kee'. Wait. Sorry. That was the name of the cricket in 'Mulan'. Easy to get confused these days...This benign, loyal side-kick serves no narrative purpose, and seems present only because side-kicks are demanded in these kinds of movies. Again, you can see the producer's memo: "Love this story, Jones! But.. could the lonely robot perhaps be not entirely alone?"It wouldn't be fair to discount WALL-E because of cuddle-factor or lack of original design, and that's not his primal malfunction: His problem is that he's a freak! A strange robot, that collects artifacts from an alien (human) civilization, and studies it, caught up in his own lonely despair. SO when the other main character, EVE, arrives, he immediately starts following her, dragging her around, oblivious as to whether she's 'there' or not.Okay, I'm being a cynic. The part between the two robots actually works! She's an advanced model, way out of his league, what plays into a "uptown girl, downtown boy" kind of romance. Also EVE is by far the funniest character in the movie (the girl has a temper). WALL-E attempts to impress EVE, with generic slapstick montage sequences to follow. They're predictable, but would again be harmless, if we had any incentive to root for WALL-E, and his desperate wooing of EVE. Being cute/clumsy just doesn't cut it as interesting character traits, and he fails to be likable. "Puss in Boots" was also adorable, but also quite deranged in his delusions of grandeur, while self-conscious enough, to use his fluffy-factor, when in a tight spot. WALL-E lacks those comedic layers, and his effectuation for EVE seems desperate.If the first half of the movie is patchy, that's nothing compared to the second half, where EVE travels back to the spaceship she came from (WALL-E ever desperately clinging on to her).We now see what has happened to humanity, and the second part seems more engulfed with them, and their dependency upon technology. People have become insanely overweight, uneducated and complacent. They now rely on machines to take care of everything from food to control of their spaceship.The satire seems thick. Yes, there are overweight Americans. Yes some Americans are less educated. But to suggest that the human race has become stupid, fat and irresponsible, is just a bit thick for me. EVE and WALL-E become tools in a story bigger than them, and their own romance is drowned. Arguably, by then you'll be happy to look at anyone/thing but WALL-E. I know I was!People might say: "Look at how simple the story is! Enjoy the beauty of it!" I respectfully disagree. I think they should have gone all out, and created an even simpler story, between two robots. What would have been PIXAR's most mature work yet, becomes it's most simple.This movie seems overproduced, caved in by the fear of what the public might want. They seem to have been desperate to make this feel good politically correct picture, right down to the notion that even though some machines might be "faulty", they can still help you.To conclude: In the end it turns out, that there's not much in 'WALL-E' that hasn't been seen before. Judging by PIXAR standard this movie is just not 'that complete package', that we've come to expect from 'Toy Story', and 'Finding Nemo'. It remains a visually stunning, tragically empty shell, seriously lacking a courageous, wicked ghost.
Wall-E is about a garbage disposal who falls in love with a sleek and refined Macintosh. Humans completely destroyed the earth and space that surrounds earth so humans had to leave over 700 years ago. Now Wall-E has found a weed and that means that life can be sustained on earth again. Wall-E catches a ride to deep space where the humans are living on a spaceship since space close to earth, as mentioned before, was also an extreme mess. Once on board we see that humans have gotten so lazy that they are all fat and cannot even turn their head to talk to their neighbor. Instead they use video conferencing to talk to people one foot to the right or left of them.I think seeing the way humans were portrayed is what irritated me the most. I did not like the story line because of this and it basically ruined the whole movie for me.I will say that my kids both stayed very interested in the movie. The animation from Pixar was top notch, as many others have said. My wife also like the move and thought it was cute. Obviously from the ratings most people have really enjoyed the movie.I simply do not feel the same as most others about this movie and it is one of the few times that I have disagreed with the masses. I actually feel like I was being generous by giving it 4 stars, but I feel that the quality of the animation should allow it to get that much.Yes we need to take care of our planet but we are also making changes for the better (ethanol, hydrogen fuel cell, electric wind energy, e-statements instead of paper). I certainly hope things don't get so bad that we have to leave for 700 years.
This will go down as the most boring movie I have seen this year. It is predictable, shallow, and paceless.Sorry guys, but I walked out of it.My 9-year old nephew had warned me: "everyone says it's boring, I don't want to watch wall-e, I want to watch Kung Fu panda (a third time)!" I thought I knew better, having read some IMDb reviews and an impressive 9.0/10 voters' grade (now down to 8.8 and no doubt soon to fall below 8 where it belongs). So I dragged everyone to the theatre, promising them something somewhat deeper and more thought-provoking than Kung-Fu panda. Duh!? yeah,sure, endless piles of rubbish make you think: for instance, why pile it up near the buildings when there are entire areas free of construction...The robots are cute, but no cuter than the robots in Star Wars (whatever their names are), and certainly no smarter. For one, they don't speak, except some kind of gibberish: it does make you wonder, doesn't it? I nearly lost all credibility with the family. I walked out early and booked us some seats for Hellboy2. My nephew loved it and forgave me my earlier mishap. Close one though.I noticed this is Disney production: well that's my explanation right there: Disney paid a bunch of unemployed losers a dollar apiece to vote tirelessly for their boring, boring, boring silly animated skit.


                
At what point do homage and tribute pass into the realm of reprehensible theft and unoriginality? Director Andrew Stanton answers this question with ham-handed blows to the mind and body with his critical darling, "Wall-E," which might as well have been called "Short Circuit meets *Apple" if not for the pack of other Sci-Fi films from which this one has swiped plot points, characters, vehicles, shots, and so forth.As the film opens, we are greeted by a sweeping shot of Earth in ruins as a sweeping showtune sweeps us away. Yet, despite all this sweeping, enormous clouds of dust manage to dominate every frame, diminishing the grandness of the vision for the sake of reality. This nonetheless jolly first moment leads into a similarly jolly first half for the film, laced with a lovely affair between WallE, who recalls a Windows 95PC, and the stunning Eve, a walking, or rather hovering, advertisement that must have made Steve Jobs proud. While Thomas Newman's score manages nothing more than to sound like every other Thomas Newman score, it's easy to get wrapped up in the Chaplin-esquire love story. Undoubtedly, "Wall-E" has a first half to die for, or at least to fork up $10. Unfortunately, things go downhill.The second half, rather than making the first seem good by comparison, is in fact so unbearable as to cancel out much of the power of the opening. Attempting to tackle hefty environmental issues and to inspire change in humanity's current behavior, Stanton and company utilize poorly rendered animated humans, voiced badly and put through a hideous subplot in which a blander version of 2001's HAL opposes the changes desired by the unbelievably earnest "Captain" of a spacecraft taken right off the shelves of the "Dune" series. Rather than simply hinting at the film's weighty moral, the film-makers actually introduce lines of dialogue that spell it out, later illustrating the implications thereof with an animated vision of Earth's future when better care is applied.Fortunately, "Wall-E" saves itself from the dreaded 1/5 rating by virtue of the fact that the love story is given at least some screen time during the dregs of the film's finale.


                
I think this was the most boring film i ve seen in years. loved finding nemo. but i cant undersand where the comedy lies within this picture. unbelievably boring. No dialogue, no comedy, nothing. THought the film would start to get better once garlin entered but my god, if only Larry David was behind his character. atrociously boring. don't bother with this one.its an insult that this film is so highly rated. probably because of the climate warming hype...which i wont even go into. i welcome all criticisms...if you like this then i wonder why. god bless. en shallah. a rivaderci.N


                
"Wall-E" is a movie about a kooky little robot. Due to problems on earth related to waste, all the humans are evacuated and put onto ships to escape until life on earth is safe (I actually missed the first five minutes as I was making popcorn but this is what I was told). Wall-E's job is to compile and clean up all the waste and ends up becoming the last thing left on earth (besides a cockroach).One day a weird robot is dropped onto Earth and seems very hostile towards Wall-E. We soon learn this robot called EVE is on a mission to find life forms. After 700 years of these robots being sent to earth without success, EVE eventually finds a plant situated in Wall-E's little container. She grabs it and is collected to return to the mother ship. The leader on the ship is stunned at EVE's success as this means a return to earth is possible- but not all seem to want to go home. Will the crew onboard, who have all got fat and lazy return to earth or will they live as they have been happily? Totally not what i expected from the movie. Not really a kids movie I would have thought as the message is too complex and it's excruciatingly slow at times. Strangely it ranked at No. #37 on IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time. I read the most rated review and came across this, which troubled me.....WALL-E is such a lovable character. I've never felt so much emotion for one character. He will definitely go down in history as iconic as Darth Vader, or Indiana Jones. I was so close to crying at pivotal parts in the film, and although I didn't fully break out and cry, I have never felt so much emotion in my heart with any other film as I did with this one.Ah, that person needs to get out to better movies. The animation is great, but the film was hard work for the viewer.
Pixar wants you to know the obvious today, and they really, really want to make sure you "get it", so they're going to take their message and put it on the end of a baseball bat and beat you over the head with it till you bleed from your eyeballs... The big message here is stop being wasteful and stop sucking down sodas because you're going to get fat... OH, and corporations just want to take your money!!! (Kind of like the $9 I spent to stare at the big screen only to be fed this patronizing schlock.) Yeah, well, its the same message I hear from every corner of the earth these days so whats the big deal?? GET FIT, DON'T POLLUTE, THE ROBOTS CAN LOVE TOO YOU KNOW!!! BIG FAT DEAL. I put the previous in all caps because I assure you the movie is screaming those themes louder than I am. And oh please everyone, PLEASE LISTEN CLOSELY, did you know that robots can fall in love??? They CAN love, and this matters SO much that we're putting it right next to the themes of destroying the world, because god, the robots CAN LOVE!!! (AMAZEMENT) (There are no robots that can love in reality, but there really is a lot trash in the landfills.) They're so lovely in their lovey loveness though, those two robots, its actually like interracial marriage. Wall-e is basically a black janitor, and Eve is a white secret agent with a special mission to fill her womb with the seed of life!!! Personally I'd rather watch spiders mate on the Discovery channel rather than two robots holding hands.Truly, this movie is not all that challenging, or groundbreaking, or thought provoking for anyone past high school. Its a kids movie that is extremely well done as a kids movie, and the themes stay neatly within that kid friendly realm.The bottom line is I don't have a desire to see it again. I can recall every significant plot moment of this film from beginning to end because basically not a whole lot happens in it. I don't need a 180 million dollar animated movie to tell me to exercise! (I've been exercising for years) I encourage Pixar to take on a serious theme in the future.


                
I am rating it 4/10 for its animation, and because it is a children's movie, the four stars are for that.The missing six stars? Oh boy, if you love this movie you're about to hate me! Wall E is a tale of a little robot (well, you've gotta give 'em credit for creating a cute character) whose job it is to monitor and clean up the huge dramatized piles of trash left over by humans on a now-uninhabitable earth. The humans? They're up in space, living the lazy life of obesity and eating what could be Soylent Green in a cup, while robots look after them on a huge ship in Outer Space. One such fatso, the captain, discovers a cover-up of the fact that the government (apparently all nations banded together on one government?) has decided that remaining in space is a better solution. How can they get out of this mess? The answer is in a little sprout that Wall E's new friend Eva the robot has found (Eva is a soil sample collector).I like pollution and hate the planet, so if you ever run into me I'll be the girl littering and spraying chemicals on the grass. Therefore I just didn't get the urge to clean up the earth after watching this. Nice effort though, Pixar.Now, about the fictional mountains of garbage in this movie, uh, yeah... with all the garbage environmentalists are saying about reducing garbage these days, the scenario in this movie won't be happening anytime soon. And it's extremely difficult to believe that the fatties in this movie could ever be so oblivious as to get on a ship and get fat like that without thinking.The soundtrack was nerve-wracking and the voices were bad and frankly very annoying, the movie also got very boring and I don't think kids would get the environmental message behind it.Wall E is okay but not really worth it, try something else if you're smart.
Wall-E is just sadly typical. There is nothing that hasn't been done time and time again in animated films, and then it just added on a cliché social commentary that really ruined the entire film for me.Hollywood, even Pixar, simply do not understand entertainment value anymore. Action movies have turned into Lifetime TV dramas with something blowing up every now and then, horror movies have to be straightforward and predictable or they're labeled as "lacking quality", dramas lack realism, and originality in every drama is simply dead. But more obvious than any of those problems is the lack of ENTERTAINMENT movies have. If a movie doesn't pack a cliché commentary about the human condition, it's seen as pulp and pointless. In order to preach these cliché morals that we've known since we were old enough to talk, the entertainment value drops considerably, if not diminishes completely. And that has officially bled over into animated movies, with Wall-E carrying the cliché banner high.I'll admit, when I first saw Wall-E I enjoyed it. Mostly. Wall-E himself is pretty cute. The adventure is giant and fun, and the love story was pretty nicely done, if not a little too predictable. The animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and shows a major improvement over the past attempts Pixar has put out. But there was hardly any humor whatsoever, the story was stale and predictable, and a lot of the movie was just uninteresting. But, as I said, the thing about Wall-E that just really bothered me was how much of the entertainment value was sucked dry to give us a social commentary that you've seen preached on the news stations every morning when you wake up. We're fat, we're using up our resources, we're polluting our planet<U+0097>great, fine, we KNOW that. We don't need a G-rated family movie trying to bash us over the head with it, what we need is a movie that is actually entertaining in a era when movies simply don't understand what "entertainment value" means.Overall, I think this is one of Pixar's better efforts, but certainly not up to the perfection a many people seem to think it is. Not even close.5/10


                
To be perfectly honest, I found WALL- E to be one of the most frightening little stories that I've seen in a mighty long time.What bothered me the most about WALL-E 's story was how I found that it made light of what I consider to be a very-very serious situation that is facing mankind on this very planet right now - And that problem is how man deals with his ever-growing headache of garbage that he continually creates.One of the most horrifying scenes in WALL-E was when the "search-craft" was leaving Earth's atmosphere (with Wall-E attached to it) and this rocket had to literally crash right through tons and tons of litter that was surrounding this planet.Now, of course, this scene was an obvious exaggeration, but, believe me, folks, tons of garbage really is out there right now orbiting this old planet of ours.I guess when it comes to this particular scene, that well-known saying comes clearly to mind - "Out of sight - Out of mind." The other brief scene in WALL-E that was equally disturbing to me clearly showed how humans were dealing with their garbage situation 700 hundred years later on the mother-ship, Axion. Here it was being compressed into uniform blocks and then (get this!) randomly fired out into space.Talk about being utterly irresponsible! It completely boggles the mind to imagine this horrid thought of blocks upon blocks of man's garbage littering outer space from one end of the galaxy to the other. But, there you have it happening right in WALL-E! I don't know about you, but, it sure looks to me like litter has certainly become man's legacy to this beloved planet, Earth - And to infinity and beyond, as well.I also couldn't help noticing that the Axion was, in a sense, very much like a "new age" Noah's Ark. But the funny thing about this "Ark-of-Survival" was that there were no animals to be found and the ratio of whites to any other race of people looked to me like about 100 to 1. (or was it more like 1000 to 1?) Yes. I do agree that when it came to WALL-E's animation, it was all so very-very wonderful to behold. But unfortunately WALL-E's story quickly disintegrated into an utterly ridiculous "love story" between, what came down to, a frickin' toaster and a blender. Do machines really do "it" better? Well, the one thing that I was relieved to see in WALL-E was that in the 700 years that humans spent floating around in the Axion, getting more stupid and obese by the minute, they at least never got around to discovering another planet out there in which they could inhabit and deface with all of their horrible litter.Phew! Thank goodness for that!And, as a final word - Hey, don't worry about the future, all of you couch-potatoes - Little "Wall-E" will be there to save the day! Right!?
In the distant future, a small waste collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey.....The animation is amazing but this story is mellifluous mindless drivel and spectacularly boring.The first half of the movie, when the interactions between wall e and the cockroach are shown, is interesting, but the second half of the film is cheesy, clichéd, and boring.The movie is slow moving and is devoid on any real plot and the two main characters are not at all engaging.This could have just been a fun movie about a Robot for kids, but instead it is trying to indoctrinate in the second half of the movie.I gave the movie a 4/10 mainly for the great animation. The story was extremely weak and was basically a love story with an environmental message/propaganda.


                
It's been so long since I saw an animated movie that was produced in these here United States that I thought was good that I can't remember what it was. Literally. Now we have Artoo Deetoo and See Threepio making out on the Big Screens at The Mall. And that's entertainment? Not where I come from. It was difficult not to nod off during this one, but I hung in there because I always go in to a movie expecting to be pleasantly surprised; maybe even enlightened; at the very least, mildly entertained. Zip. Nada. Nein. While anthropomorphism is okay when it comes to cgi animals, cgi robots are another thing entirely (so to speak). ASTRO BOY is a personal favorite of mine, and I liked ROBOTS a whole lot (due mostly to the voicework of Robin Williams), but WALL-E malfunctions on so many levels that it's hard to know where to begin. For one thing, he has no personality. Bells and whistles just don't cut it, no matter how many millions of dollars you spend on cgi: a soulless automaton is still a soulless automaton. Look at Republicans.
this movie is overrated.the first 15-20 minutes wasn't that bad but then the plot got dumb,the pacing was terrible the romance plot was cliché.i kept looking at my watch during the movie back at the movie theaters since i knew how long the movie was.i was disappointed with the movie.i was expecting more since it was pixar that made it.of course,the animation is still stunning to watch.the movie did had some good moments like when wall-e is investigating everyday life things like bras,rubix cubes,etc.overall,it was a boring depressing disappointing animated film from pixar studios.shame,they made great animated classics.oh well.


                
Put this on and found it hard work to maintain concentration due to the overly drawn out sequences, lack of dialogue, and beige backdrop for much of the first half of the film.If you're not into 'the beauty of animation' and just want to watch a good film you'll struggle with this like we did.Once the story got going it was entirely predictable, but a good message. I just wish more of the film had been devoted to this than to two synthetics incapable of love dancing around for the other hour and a half.I love animation when it's done well, but this was on the whole, boring, and didn't make us feel much at all apart from a gentle nod at the important overall message that wasn't given enough prominence.
