 See it, but ask no-one about it, don't even read the reviews,

 Gem of a show

 Visually stunning

 Best thing since Lost

 Spectacular if weirdly realistic vision of the future

 I've never watched anything this intense and I have watched over 2 Terabytes of movies/television.

 The best show ever made.

 One of the best

 Gorgeous

 Nerve jangling, disturbing and thoroughly thought provoking

 Utopia - One of the best television series currently on the air

 Dark & Brutal. Love It!

 Quite honestly one of THE best shows I have ever seen!

 Great new TV Drama series, looking forward to season 2!

 One of the best TV shows I've ever seen

 When shock value works .. and when it doesn't

 The best TV show you've probably never heard of!

 Visually stunning, psychologically chilling, utterly thrilling.

 Holy Crap! Shockingly Good!

 Wow!

 Eye opening

 Brilliant!

 A Remarkable Piece of Cult Television

 Best drama of decade!

 "The best thing on British TV for years..."
