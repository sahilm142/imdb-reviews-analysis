 A slow-paced journey that tends to succeed with atmosphere and complexity.

 Nail biting fantastic mystery thriller

 Blows your mind!

 Heavily influenced by Twin Peaks but still very good

 Keeps you hooked on, but too many characters to Remember and link!

 Complex and risky - hallelujah!

 Dark German mystery

 For a weekend stuck on the screen ..

 Not perfect, but worth a try

 Dark, Suspenseful, gripping

 A mystery thriller that keeps you guessing

 Best story...

 Best serie about time travel .

 Demanding, compelling, unresolved

 The show is worth the effort of the mental gymnastics required to understand Dark

 Really worth watching

 A delightfully supernatural treat.

 Something like Strange Things

 Don't be fooled by episode 1

 A really great show that gripped my attention and is worthy of a watch

 Binge watching won't work on that one

 Brain burnt out

 Amazing German Mystery Show

 More Fillers than Canon story

 Need lot of patience
