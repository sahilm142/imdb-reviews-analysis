My Rating: 1/10I was intrigued by the high rating and thought to give it a chance. Unfortunately it failed to impress.It feels dated now and doesn't hold as well as a Casablanca or Double Indemnity. I really wanted to like this movie but the dialogues, the acting, the slow narrative simply don't work in 2018.Surely it could have been better. Do watch the ones I mentioned above or The Maltese Falcon or The African Queen which are leaps and bounds better and far superior in every regard.


                
I've little comment to give beyond saying this movie was a pain to sit through. A previous reviewer mentioned the age of the story, and was right to do so. I don't think I've ever seen a worse rendition. It was blatantly obvious from the beginning -- as was everything else about the movie -- who would succumb and what the result was. There were neither surprises nor good acting nor good writing. Huston's "Howard" was the only non-painful part of the movie, and that's hardly an endorsement.
