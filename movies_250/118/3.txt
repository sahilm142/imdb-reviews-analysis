1st watched 11/14/2009 - 3 out of 10 (Dir- Akira Kurosawa): Confusing feudal piece about an old samurai warrior coming into a town and causing confusion between the parties leading to greater destruction because of it. Toshiro Mifune plays the samurai who kind of plays with both parties and tricks them into hating each other even more by his manipulative ways. Initially, it's a little comedic how he plays with them but them he gets beaten up and the innocent get thrown into the mix and the humor leaves. This movie is really hard to follow because it's hard to identify each party as unique. One group are gamblers and the others are protectors of a brothel. The town obviously has no real presence of authority but the drifter doesn't bring any of that into play by being there. I'm assuming that this is because the wars are over and there is no one in power. I'm sure it would help to understand a little of the Japanese history to understand this movie -- unfortunately I have none. The movie really becomes pretty brutal and those left standing are just lucky -- I guess. Mifune's portrayal is a little confusing as well as he kind of snickers at both sides until he's beaten up and then he takes things into his own hands. A much heralded Japanese director in Akira Kurasawa made this film but I'm sorry I just didn't get the appeal of this movie.
