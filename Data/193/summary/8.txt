 I Think God Has A Sense Of Humor, Don't You?

 Still funny, after 25 years

 Just when you thought you were saved...

 My Favourite Scene

 Still the funniest movie ever!

 Classic British Comedy !

 Python at their best

 Spot on comedy and decent social commentary.

 Refreshing Satire but lacks substance

 Good comedy, good and intelligent movie

 Very Funny Film

 Life Of BRIAN

 Classic Monty Python satire

 The best of the Python Movies

 Monty Python's Best Film

 He's not the Messiah; he's a very naughty boy!

 Humor at its best.

 This is religious, political, funny satire.

 Nothing can be as original as this.

 this is a FUNNY film

 Pretty good though not the best Python

 One of the Best

 wicked, funny, biting satire

 I think it was "Blessed are the cheesemakers".

 Do You Think God Laughed At This?
