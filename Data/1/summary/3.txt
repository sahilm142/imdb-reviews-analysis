 Very unoriginal

 Too flawed

 absurd and so predictable

 Saccharine

 I thought there were supposed to be no fairytales?

 absurdly overrated

 To predictable

 Over rated

 Sometimes, we all just don't agree.

 Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction

 A Prison Story that will leave you wanting...

 for me its like 50 50 not to good or not to bad

 Morgan Freeman is the only great thing in this movie

 Not That Great

 The Prison Of Storytelling

 Funniest film I've seen in years

 Not worth the hype, a script full of shortcuts

 storyline view

 The most over-rated movie in history

 very fantastic movie

 review
