 A Bloody Masterpiece!

 Addictive...had to get showtime after a taste on the freeview weekend!

 A wonderful new look at the crime drama.

 Wow

 Excellent

 Oodles of Potential.....

 Breathless

 Hilarious show! Dark, dry humor with CSI's ...

 I just could'not sleep !!

 I just love this series!

 Finally, The Sopranos void has been filled!

 Wasn't expecting it to be this good...

 A brilliant ride, and my utmost favourite above all others, but I myself get off at Season 4.

 "A Showtime Masterpiece"

 Greatest show on TV.

 So Good! My Favorite Show on TV (as of 2011)

 At last something to look forward to each year!

 Disappointed by the ending..

 I've seen a few but..

 Thank god they cast Michael C. Hall as Dexter

 Riveting, compelling and addictive.

 what a series

 Addictive!

 Best tv series

 I don't know how anyone can think this show is bad.
