I understand that this is supposed to be a classic show. I also understand that a lot of Monthy Python fans are hooked to this. I even understand the people who will be clicking the NO button down there when asked if they found this review helpful.I just don't get this show.Granted, some people might find certain situations in the series funny. I can't really say that I do. I didn't laugh with this show, I barely smiled. Maybe I don't get British "humor". Odd, though, because I kind of like the original "The Office". And I can see how some people wouldn't think that is a very funny show at all. However, I can find dark humor funny. Normal comedy that is not funny... well, that, I don't get.Still, I suppose it doesn't matter what I say, this will continue to be a cult series. Same goes for all with Monty Phyton stamped on it. I'm just not a Python person, I'm afraid.Although, I can see bad acting when it's in front of me. And Fawlty has plenty. Perhaps Cleese could have done something for this show if he would have been surrounded by a better cast.I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 3 due to the "Classic/cult" status.


                
Fawlty Towers will live on forever as one of the best sitcoms ever long after all the so called "comedies" of today have all been discarded. It remains a classic after all these years and that is down to the quality of the writing by John Cleese and Connie Booth and the performances that the cast all give.Not many sitcoms live on so well in the memory as well as Fawlty Towers and each episode has now become beloved for different reasons.It's a shame that many people see this as the highlight of the career of John Cleese as the man has done great work since but to be remembered for Fawlty Towers surely can never be a bad thing.
