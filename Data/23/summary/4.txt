 Ridiculously overrated, with plot holes that are impossible to ignore

 Ordinary movie lifted by one extraordinary performance

 Preposterous.Psychobabble meets schlock horror.Laughable.

 Why?

 Silence of the Clams

 Making movies from stories they don't understand

 Boring

 Could have been better
