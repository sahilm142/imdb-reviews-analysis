OFAH is a show that didn't exactly hit me in the face and bowl me over bruv. In fact I had trouble getting through the entire first series. Once I did get through it I appreciated it's charm. It is not exactly laugh aloud fall off my chair kind of stuff but the chemistry between the actors is great and the story lines have appeal. It took me to be a little inebriated to catch on to this show otherwise I never had the patience to get through an entire show but once I did I was on a roll. As for it being voted the best British comedy well....that's another matter bruv. I had a little trouble accepting the obvious differences in appearance between David jason and nicholas lyndhurst but once I found myself overcoming this obvious but insignificant little hurdle, I accepted it for what it is.
