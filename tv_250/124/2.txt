Seriously.... How is this rubbish so highly rated? Are you people really that easily impressed with this series?Please don't answer. I dread to think what anyone would say to defend this awful pretentious anime. Now, I'd better first admit: I only got as far as episode 17. A lot of arguments would defend I haven't seen enough to judge it but I know from experience that it will not improve or change my mind. Without giving away spoilers, it is hard to explain what made me dislike this show so much so fast. The broad explanation I can give is that I really did not like the main characters AT ALL. Especially after watching the 17th episode which glorifies one of the characters in such an irritating over the top way. I'm at the stage now where I seriously can't stand most modern Japanese animes. It feels like they hit their peak in the mid 90s and everything since has become a formulae of stupid happy go lucky ultra optimistic main characters with over the top hairstyles; goofy intros and outros; long painful episodes of characters gasping and grunting at each other; silly monologues of the character explaining what just happened....ugh I could rant on but I'm sure you get the picture. I should've realised I was wasting my time watching this when I found myself rooting for the characters I'm not supposed to like over the ones who are made to look ultra badass and dominant.I would not recommend this anime to anyone but I can't see my review making any difference. People either love these types of series to bits or would never try watching them in the first place. This review is just an outlet for me to vent really, since I was starting to enjoy this show and it's potential creativity (love the idea of a main character using a fishing rod as a weapon).LAter peeps. I'm done with Japanese anime series altogether.
