 All that is wrong with urban youth!

 3 and a half hours of, "When does this get good?"

 A masala movie glorifying mindless jingoism

 A cleverly concealed propaganda film

 Dire message, dreadful waste of wonderful Bollywood actors and production

 Just Brutal

 Worst movie of 2006

 intellectual shallowness

 Berang Basanti

 yawn

 Rang de basanti ...:-(

 Way Complicated

 This movie is a waste of time... Jai Hind

 How Can Anyone Agree With The Subject Matter?
