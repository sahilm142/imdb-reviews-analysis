Let's just throw out the profanity argument: this show is horrible even if we come to the incorrect conclusion that people in this time and place used terms like "motherless c*nt" (they did not).The only thing worse than a fat man in a yellow bikini is a fat man in a yellow bikini who thinks he's attractive. Thus the delusion this show suffers. Never have I come across a television show that tries so hard to show off its writing. Laughter is the only fitting response to the ponderous, labored writing.And most amusing is the praise heaped on this show by people who are easily romanced by what they interpret as fancy language.I'll give the show 3 stars based on the fine actors, their efforts wasted on third rate hack writing.


                
I have seen praise heaped upon this show. I thought it would be very interesting and entertaining. I just watched the first episode of the first season, and I don't know what the hell is going on. Constant repetition of fu**ing c**t, and c**ksucker is distracting. In addition to the foul language, the dialog seems rather stilted. I find it very unnatural to hear a man in jail, facing execution, to ask "what are you two conversing at?" Where the grotesque characters, foul language, and unintelligible dialog are absent, the viewer may be impressed by the scenery and period dress. And what is with referring to Sioux as "c**ksuckers?"Update 9-25-06I have watched 4 episodes of the 1st season. I think this show is pretty bad. The theme song is great, you would think you have a great western in store. But everything is pretty bad. I can never tell what is going on from scene to scene. The acting is terrible. It is disjointed with no overall theme for an episode. Calamity Jane is annoying as hell, and Bullock gets mad over who knows what? I saw him shout "f**k" when his partner pointed out that his suspenders were down. The owner of the Gem is very bad. One sentence with powers boothe is (paraphrasing) "we aren't a f**king country, we are waiting to be annexed by the f**king co**su**king U.S. Where is our co**su**ing flag, where are our f**king laws."I think this series is pretty bad. I am trying to like it. Something keeps me renting each episode on DVD. I just don't get it. The language is boring with the effect being distracting.Update 10-10-06I just completed the first season. It gets better towards the end of the season. Bullock is still pretty bad. I think I love Trixie.


                
I became a huge fan of Tim Olyphant from watching "Justified." I purchased the DVD for season 1 of "Deadwood" with high hopes. I was only able to get through the first two episodes with much difficulty. I was watching it with my wife. I think the acting seemed to be pretty good, but I couldn't tolerate the language. It is just not the level of filth that I am able to put up with. It is not exactly what I want to submit my wife to for a pleasant evening together. I simply can't think of any compelling reason to have everyone talking like they did -- even if they really did talk that way "back in the day." (And how would the writers know that anyway?) If a constant stream of extremely coarse language isn't a problem for you, you probably will enjoy this series. If bad language is a problem for you, save your time and money.


                
Without a doubt, there is some darn good acting in it. BUT Despite the argument that the foul language lends authenticity, it does not. In fact, there is very little that is historically accurate. The film uses names that existed in 1876, but that's about as far as authenticity goes. I'm surprised that HBO was sued for libel by descendants of some of the portrayed characters, such as E.B. Farnum and George Hearst. But, I'm not a lawyer, so...Season 1, good. Season 2 winds up well- wow! for a final episode.Season 3- what the blazes was that! ( blazes = 19th century cussin' ) The theatrical troupe lent nothing to the story! Except for a rather ambiguous homosexual thing. (Ambiquous for me, anyway.)Possible spoiler: Seth Bullock is accessory to 1st degree murder! Hello!? Totally "wonderful" ending there!"But," they say, "that's how thing are in the REAL world." If I want real world, I can get it in the nearest bar. Great acting, though.
