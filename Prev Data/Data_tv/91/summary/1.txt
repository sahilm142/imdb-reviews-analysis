 Junk

 Series finale episode protest

 The ending ruins it

 Sad silly misguided viewers

 First 4 seasons are Fantastic...But it goes down hill from there

 Should have ended with series 5

 American Psycho for Dummies

 Bad morals and boring TV series.

 A show that glorifies sadism

 horrific!

 Terrible show, terrible characters

 Dilemma! First season is good.

 Dexter's Lavatory

 Most Boring show ever.
