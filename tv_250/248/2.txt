Again, a new series spoon feeds us too much simplified dialog, too many overacting characters, and another swill of pussified bad-asses. Where's the edge? Where's the action that thrills us so much we don't need verbal exposition? Technically, we're always advancing. Photography is great, costumes, makeup even. Everyone's doing their job except the writer.The denouement montage was strenuous and contrived, but the scene right before with the young cop and the girl at the hospital seemed to have the most truth of the whole hour. Tell the truth! Mute the dialog! Give our ears a break! Don't tell us it's a crack addict, show us!Have a nice day!
