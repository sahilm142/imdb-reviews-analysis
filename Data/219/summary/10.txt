 One Of The All-Time Great Westerns

 One of the best of the 60s & 70s

 A One of a Kind

 A Perfect Script For a Near-Perfect Movie

 "Who are those guys?"

 Stands the test of time...

 A reminder of how film-making can be an art: acting, screenplay, score and filming all.

 "Do you know what you are doing?" "Theoretically."

 R.I.P Paul "Legend" Newman

 I can't imagine any other actors playing these roles

 Trust Newman-Redford to deliver.....with Extremely Beautiful photography<U+0085>.
