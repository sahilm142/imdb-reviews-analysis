A sunny charmer with clouds enough to darken the edges of the screen, "Paper Moon" presents us with an entertainment of equal parts wit and sentiment, an underdog story that delivered a real underdog outcome in the form of a historic Oscar win for nine-year- old Tatum O'Neal.In the time of the Great Depression, a little girl named Addie (Tatum) is left abandoned by the death of her mother, a woman who hung around in bars and left Addie with a big mystery as far as the identity of her father is concerned. At her gravesite, a dodgy stranger named Moses (Ryan O'Neal) happens by to pay his respects, and is immediately recruited by the other mourners, who don't want to be burdened with the girl, with the assignment of delivering Addie to her next-of-kin."God works in mysterious ways," one of the mourners says, after Moses reluctantly accepts."Don't He now?" Moses replies.God indeed may have some unfinished business with Moses Pray, a conman who uses the Good Book as his device for fleecing newly-made widows of a few bucks. Watching the O'Neals work their family chemistry for sparks and laughs while Moses, with unexpected help from Addie, works his scams, is great fun. A lingering question is whether Moses and Addie are in fact related; many in the movie point out their similar jawlines, but Moses refuses to accept the idea. Addie is more open to it. Clearly Moses for all his faults fills a hole in her life.There was a time when Peter Bogdanovich could do no wrong as a director; here he presents us with an assured callback to 1930s- period sensibilities by employing a flat Kansas landscape and scenic design that suggests a combination of Norman Rockwell and Grant Wood, at once homey and vaguely grotesque. The story moves fast, the dialogue is crisp and believable, and the O'Neals' performances of such strong quality as to make you wonder why they so seldom impressed in other roles. The talent is there on the screen.Tatum was the real surprise here; decades later, long after the flash of her career faded, it's hard not to be as bowled over by what she gives you as all those critics and movie-goers were so long ago. Avoiding the cutesiness of child actors, she plays her character as sharp-tongued and vinegary, with a hint of real beauty beneath the smudges. "Ain't she got a sweet little face, somehow," is the best anyone can manage in the way of compliments, but Addie don't need them. She just wants her 200 dollars, or "two hundra DOLLA" as she keeps putting it to Moses.The two of them make such a pair I get annoyed when Madeline Kahn joins them for a time as a conniving, cheapjack vixen named Trixie. Unlike the O'Neals, Kahn is an actress I usually enjoy in anything, so why is she so duff to me here? Trixie is a one-note performance that grates on me; I can't wait for the Prays to leave her in their dust.I did enjoy P. J. Johnson as Trixie's put-upon maid, Imogene. She adds some heart and gives Addie some company for some of the movie's best scenes. So too does a raft of supporting players, most of whom like Kahn must have been waiting for Mel Brooks' call-backs for "Blazing Saddles" at the time of this production.Mostly, though, this is Tatum's film; it rises or falls with her and, as a result of her spry performance, rises quite impressively. Bogdanovich clearly gambled putting his promising career on her little shoulders; unlike later gambles of his this paid off spectacularly and yields dividends to this day.


                
Nine-year-old Addie Loggins is the centerpiece of Peter Bogdanovich's affectionate 1973 comedy set during the depths of the Great Depression. The filmmaker was on a roll at the time as he made the coming-of-age saga, 1971's "The Last Picture Show", and the screwball throwback, 1972's "What's Up, Doc?", in quick succession. Cineaste that he is, Bogdanovich filmed this episodic, character-driven comedy deliberately in black and white, inspired by classics as diverse as Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid", Vittorio de Sica's "Bicycle Thieves" and even John Ford's "The Searchers". The result is charming if a bit overlong for the simple story being told. As the film opens in Kansas, Addie just lost her mother, and she is to be taken to live with relatives in Missouri. Enter traveling Bible salesman Moses Pray, a small-time grifter who bilks recent widows out of cash under the pretense that their late husbands had ordered personalized Bibles before their deaths. As a chronic womanizer, he knew Addie's free-living mother and promises to take her to her relatives after he extorts $200 from a local business owner.The rest of the story is an entertaining road movie centered on the evolving relationship between Moses and Addie as she shows to have a greater gift for scams than he does. A tough-talking smoker who loves radio, Addie is a tomboy frequently mistaken for a boy, while Moses constantly resists his paternal feelings toward her even though they are kindred spirits. Complications occur first with the appearance of a tawdry carnival stripper named Trixie Delight, who threatens to come between Moses and Addie, and then with a bootlegger and his look-alike sheriff brother, who are in hot pursuit over a scam around crates of illegal whiskey. As Addie, Tatum O'Neal still has the distinction of being the youngest actor to win a competitive Oscar, and in her film debut, her unprecocious performance reflects refreshingly confident work from a child. Perhaps fearful that his daughter was stealing the movie, a well-founded fear it turns out, her father Ryan does some of his best screen work as Moses, better cast here than as bumbling musicologist Howard Bannister in "What's Up, Doc?".As she proved with her hilarious portrayal of Howard's persnickety fiancée Eunice in "What's Up, Doc?", Madeline Kahn is an unparalleled scene-stealer as Trixie, especially as she tries to coax a belligerent Addie off a grassy hilltop. Just before peaking in Mel Brooks' farces and reunited with the elder O'Neal, Kahn shows what she can do to maximize less than half-hour of screen time. Almost as funny is the eye-rolling cynicism of P.J. Johnson as Trixie's indentured servant Imogene. The 2003 DVD has two substantial extras. First, Bogdanovich offers a full-length commentary full of his personal remembrances and sharing a deep well of cinematic knowledge. The second is Laurent Bouzereau's "The Making of Paper Moon", an exhaustive making-of featurette divided into three parts, which covers all aspects of the film's development and production and includes comments from Bogdanovich, his then-wife Polly Platt who did the production design, cinematographer László Kovács, and producer Frank Marshall.


                
Two years after The Last Picture Show (1971), a sophisticated drama, Peter Bogdanovich gives us another black and white period piece. But Paper Moon is something else, a hybrid of crime comedy and maybe a family drama. It starts with 9-year-old Addie at her mother's funeral, where she meets a friend of her mother, the con man Moses Pray. Moze gets $200 for Addie in compensation for her mom's death, then blows half of it on a new car for himself. The film begins to pick up and become very funny when the little girl demands her money back, showing herself worldly and forceful for her age- likely a product of being raised by a "loose" woman. Addie also suspects Moze may be her dad, which he denies- after a long pause, indicating he either knows he is or believes it's possible.What we have from here is an unusual (maybe) father-daughter story, in which the two bond, but never in a sweet and sugary way. They don't get sentimental- instead, she picks up Moze's tricks and joins in the fun, making his con jobs more equitable by sparing the impoverished and getting more out of the rich. They're on the wrong side of the law, but in their own way, each does have scruples. In the end, Addie is offered a sweet and sugary life in a comfortable home- and doesn't want it, because she prefers life with Moze, because she isn't perfect and doesn't want perfect, and the audience can feel that's who she is and can understand.Paper Moon slows down a little in the middle, when Madeline Kahn comes into the picture and Moze and Addie mess with a bootlegger. But in my view, the big payoff comes when they're arrested and pull off an extremely clumsy escape. It's a good laugh, and adds to Paper Moon's many charms.
In the early seventies director Peter Bogdanovich looked like he would be part of the talented roster of new Hollywood film makers (Spielberg, Coppola, Lucas) that had suddenly burst onto the scene. Bogdanovich a film critic and confidante of the likes of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock had like the others learned his chops through the Roger Corman horror school with an impressive debut horror cheapie featuring Boris Karloff called Targets. He then followed up with three straight box office and critical hits, The Last Picture Show, What's Up Doc? and arguably his best, Paper Moon. Moon traverses the same dusty roads of the depression era that the earlier Bonnie and Clyde does and while there's a lot less gun play it's very much the same rollicking bumpy ride.Moses Pray hustles bibles on unsuspecting widows to make a living when he reluctantly agrees to take recently orphaned Addie Loggins to her aunt in Missouri. Addie suspects that Moses could be her father, something he wants no part of. Addie it turns out is every bit as streetwise as Pray and the two form an uneasy alliance and con their way across the countryside. For part of the trip Trixie Delight a woman of dubious character and her much put upon maid join them but Addie soon puts a stop to that by devising a clever set-up. The two are soon back on the road alone where things get uglier but not enough to destroy this delightful pictures sunny disposition.As he did in Last Picture Show Bogdanovich again displays a deft touch for black and white film composition. Of course it helps to have master cinematographers like Robert Surtees (Show) and Laszlo Kovacs lensing the work but it is Bogdanovich who manages to convey the very different feel of both films through his actors and the mood he establishes (nostalgia without crushing sentimentality) that fits so well with the somber monochromatic imagery.The usually dull Ryan O'Neil gives a commendable performance as the flustered con-artist Moses. Playing mostly straight man to Addie he is always a step behind her as she indirectly takes charge on more than one occasion to save the day. Argumentative and abrasive as their screen characters are with each other, father daughter chemistry has never transferred to screen so well. Tatum O'Neil's Addie can't help but walk away with the show as the orphaned waif priming herself for a life of hard knocks. She's no Shirley Temple or for that matter Little Miss Sunshine. She's observant, knows how to play the game and easily outwits most adults she matches wits with. Her tough exterior belies the helpless little girl stereotype making her vulnerable moments all the more powerful. The film ultimately belongs to her character but you never know it when Madeline Khan's Trixie Delight shows up. This terrific supporting actress from the seventies gave any film she appeared in back then a boost and she does here as the brassy, mean spirited threat to Addie.Bogdonovich's talent deserted him shortly after this with terrible comedies (Nickelodeon, They All Laughed), dull dramas (Daisy Miller, St. Jack) and an horrendous musical (At Long Last Love) but if anyone is in search of some of the best B&W films of the past 40 years they could start with Picture Show and this little gem.


                
**SPOILER**I didn't know what to expect when I saw this film recently for the first time. An American friend, while I was over there, made me watch it as he knew I loved 'The Last Picture Show'.What I saw unfold before me was an adorable film, shot and crafted lovingly. It has for me, all of the key elements that are required to make movies exceptional. The storyline is engaging, the acting is brilliant and the photography is beautiful. My one gripe about the film is that it has a big flat spot in the middle. Addy's detailed plan and execution to get rid of Trixie takes a little more time than it ought to. It then leads to the lengthy scene introducing us to the bootlegers.What follows though is one of my favourite moments in cinema. The build up of the whole story that leads us to the finale. My heart was pounding throughout the chase sequence which sees Moze run down a blind alley - a bit of a cinematic cliché, but never handled better in my opinion. Addy waits for Moze, but is he really coming? It's fantastic! [Fans of the film 'LEON' should see 'Paper Moon', it clearly influenced Luc Besson's modern classic. Many moments are replicated - the child smoking, the child who knows better and even the ending. Leon and Moze both go down blind alleys when they are supposed to be at a meeting point. The outcome is different, but the set up is the same. Cinematic ally, it works like a charm.]The final scene in 'Paper Moon' between Addy and Moze is perfect. It verges on sentimentality, but no sentimental dialogue transpires - In fact the dialogue is in opposition to how they feel. The visual story does the work and that is what I love most about this film.The elements counter act each other. The acting drives the story and vice versa. The photography is gorgeous and tells the visual story with such detail that it could reduce me to tears. The photography never overpowers the characters, but it gives us a different relationship between Addy and Moze than their dialogue does. The photography and the subtle visual acting is what tells us how much they love each other, not their dialogue. My favourite type of film-making.All in all a must see movie and good enough for me to have sent to America for a copy. (region 2 is unavailable.)Big flat spot in the middle but cinematic genius for the rest. 9 out of 10
I'm not one for nepotism, but the father/daughter team of Ryan O'Neal and Tatum O'Neal in Paper Moon is undeniably entertaining. Those two work really well together. This film is an interesting mix of humor and drama, placing a light-hearted con artist story in the midst of the great depression. Tatum definitely deserved the Academy Award she won for this performance.


                
Touching, amusing & consistently engaging, Paper Moon is an expertly directed, smartly scripted & excellently performed comedy drama that finds the real-life father-daughter duo of Ryan & Tatum O'Neal dazzle the viewers with their strong individual inputs & impeccable chemistry, and is one of the best films of its year.Set during the Great Depression, the story concerns a conman who meets a 9-year old girl at her mother's graveyard service, and is coerced into delivering her to her guardians. Initially using her misfortune to make some money off a third party, the two end up forging an unlikely partnership and work together to swindle some more folks.Directed by Peter Bogdanovich, Paper Moon brings its tightly-woven screenplay to life in splendid detail and is entirely devoted to its characters & their shared journey. The dialogues are sharp and accelerating the plot at all times, while the interaction between the two main characters is carried out with such precision that it's the film's highlight.The era-appropriate set pieces only add more authenticity to its timeline. Cinematography makes crisp use of greyscale photography & high contrast to give its image a sharp clarity and employs numerous long takes as well which only makes the drama more immersive. Editing keeps the flow smooth & streamlined, and unfolds the plot at a fitting pace.The most impressive thing about Paper Moon, however, are its performances. With Ryan O'Neal playing the conman & his daughter Tatum O'Neal making her screen debut in the role of the young orphan, the developing bond between the two is the soul of this picture. While Ryan chips in with a solid performance, Tatum steals the limelight with effortless ease and is the real star of this movie.On an overall scale, Paper Moon is an engrossing, entertaining & endearing delight that has all the ingredients of an instant classic and still hasn't aged a day. Filled with compelling characters, told with superb composure and further uplifted by the gripping performances of its cast, Paper Moon is one of the finest films of the 1970s and has effectively endured the test of time. In short, these aren't everyday people and this is no ordinary movie. Highly recommended.


                
From Golden Globe nominated director Peter Bogdonovich (What's Up, Doc?), I had mainly heard about this film because it was the one that made the record for the youngest actress to win an Academy Award (besides Shirley Temple at 6 with an honorary one), I was keen to see if the performance was worthy, and whether it is a great film as well. Basically, set in Great Depression era in Missouri and Kansas, the story follows con man Moses Pray (Golden Globe nominated Ryan O'Neal) who travels around with ten year old Addie Loggins (Oscar and Golden Globe (nominated and) winning Tatum O'Neal) to take her back to her Aunt in St. Joseph, Missouri, but she finds out he took $200 to take her, and she wants him to give it back to her. Addie is the orphaned daughter of a prostitute, and Moses had an affair with her mother, but he denies he is her father, besides bearing some resemblance, including having a similar jaw. Along the way she finds out how he earns his money, he finds the names and address in newspaper obituaries of women who has recently been widowed, and goes to visit them as a worker of the "Kansas Bible Company", "spreading the Lord's gospel", and claiming their dead husband ordered a bible but didn't pay, and they fall for it. With this knowledge in mind Addie decides to get her owed money to help Moses in any way she can, whether it is looking cute to get more money, or helping him get out of a bad situation, and they seem to make a good team, even while bickering. Along the way they pick up stripper who calls herself Trixie Delight (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Madeline Kahn), as well as her trampled upon African-American maid Imogene (P.J. Johnson), Addie becomes friends with the maid but jealous of his father's female friend gaining the attention. She finds out that Moses spent all the money they earned on a new car to impress Trixie, so she decides to get rid of her, with Imogene's help they manage to steal some money to allow the maid to get away, and Trixie is made to look guilty of an affair with another man. After ditching Trixie, Moses and Addie continue travelling, and they stop at a bootleggers on the way, stealing some bottles of whiskey, and selling it back to the same bootlegger, and after they find out his brother is the police sheriff. After being arrested Moses and Addie, she has hidden their money, and they manage to steal their car back and escape to trade their vehicle for another, and they make it across the border where the law can't follow. The sheriff finds them in Missouri and he beats Moses very severely, but he is alright and he drops Addie off to her aunt's house, and driving away a little bit he stops to look at a photo of her in a paper moon, and the little girl catches up running to him, and reminding him of the money he owes her they drive away together. Also starring John Hillerman as Deputy Hardin / Jess Hardin and Randy Quaid as Leroy. Ryal O'Neal is fantastic as the often antagonistic and manipulative fake salesman and possible father, but his real life daughter Tatum does almost steal the show as his bratty and clever beyond her age girl who joins him (she beat Linda Blair in The Exorcist, but she did deserve it), and Kahn gets her time on screen as well as the bitchy showgirl who seems to only care about herself. The pairing of the real life father and daughter makes fantastic scenes with great scripting and dialogue, it is frequently funny, at moments thrilling, and heart warming in certain scenes as well, overall it is a wonderfully brilliant period comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. Very good!
In depression-era Kansas, Bible selling con man Ryan O'Neal (as Moses Pray) takes 10-year-old Tatum O'Neal (as Addie Loggins) from her mother's funeral, to locate an aunt in Missouri. Along the way, the father and daughter figures find something more important. Peter Bogdanovich's direction, László Kovács' beautiful black and white photography, and the nostalgic soundtrack help put "Paper Moon" over. The O'Neals are at their very best - full advantage of their genetic harmony is taken; and, it's not an idea that always works, on screen. Madeline Kahn (as Trixie Delight) heads up an outstanding supporting cast. Mr. Bogdanovich's vision of Joe David Brown's "Paper Moon" may not always find its place on the "comedy-drama" scale; but, it's still an excellent film. ******** Paper Moon (5/9/73) Peter Bogdanovich ~ Ryan O'Neal, Tatum O'Neal, Madeline Kahn, P.J. Johnson


                
This is one of those films that I think a person of any age can really enjoy. It has a timeless quality to it that will see it endure as a great comedy for many years to come.


                
I love both actors chemistry. Cute, funny and make me happy from start to end. Nice!


                
Coming in, I was under the impression Paper Moon was going to be a more sprightly and plot- driven film like The Sting. Instead, and fortunately, it's a character-driven film that doesn't rely on pulling the rug from under your feet, even though the lowlife characters are constantly trying to fool others. It's the dynamic between its two primary characters that make it work. Ryan O'Neal is otherwise a pretty bland actor, but he's thoroughly compelling as a slimy charmer with a compassionate side. He takes the whole film under his wing, though it's not necessarily a great performance, just one that suits the circumstance. I'm not sure why Tatum O'Neal won an Oscar besides perhaps out of the category fraud. She has a few good moments but is otherwise vacant compared to her father. The writing is tight and economic, almost to a point where it's left me too hungry for more time with the characters and info on their backgrounds. Can a script be too efficient? Its crisp black and white cinematography conjures a nostalgic yet volatile world but even so, Paper Moon is lots of fun, with a bond you can invest in.8/10


                
Ah selling bibles to the widows of the recently deceased. That is the "job" of Moses Pray, played by Ryan O'Neal, and it's an "Oh man, oh god, oh man, oh god" free performance. ;) The film also stars Tatum O'Neal (his real life daughter, if you hadn't guessed already) and the great late Madeline Kahn.The film begins at a little girls' mum's funeral, Addie Loggins (played naturally by T. O'Neal). In comes Moses Pray, distractingly I might add. He claims to be a friend of Addie's mother, although the two women comment on how much he looks like Addie. He denies all accusations, but obliges to the request of the two women and takes Addie with him. Her destination is her Aunt Billie's in St. Joseph Missouri. Along the way, he swindles a shop owner out of 200 dollars (the shop owner is the brother of the man who killed Addie's mother) by claiming that he is her father. Moses is all set to send Addie off on a train, when she confronts him about the 200 dollars (he used the majority of it on fixing up his car). She claims it to be her own (which it is) and orders him to give her the money, even threatening to tell the police on him. This forces Moses to take Addie with him. They as a team scam widows out of money for a bible, supposedly ordered by their then alive husbands. Traveling together, they learn about each other, and form a friendship.The father-daughter relationship between the O'Neals is truly special and both of them churn in great performances, Tatum more-so. Tatum displays a lot of acting maturity, there were times when I forgot she was just a child. She won a supporting actress Oscar for her truly special performance. But I have to wonder, why she was put in such a category. She's so clearly lead and I don't know how anyone could think otherwise. You take her character out of the movie and you basically have nothing. Anyways, I don't want to debate her placement any further than what I did. She's lead in my mind, if you think otherwise, it's not going to make it any tougher for me to sleep at night. I'm rambling, let's continue along with the review. The person I was most impressed with (and not surprised in the least) was Madeline Kahn. She was a master comedian, and her speech on the hill is one of my favourite monologues in film ever. She's flawless in the role, and her character is almost tragic. My favourite line of hers is "Let ol' Trixie sit up front with her big tits." Absolutely mesmerizing in every way possible.I would recommend this, just for Miss Kahn's performance.8.0/10
Plot-- A small-time con-man agrees to escort a 10-year old orphaned girl to her aunt's house in 1930's rural Kansas. But on the way, the challenges mount. So how did they transfer a 50-year old brain into 10-year old Addy's head. And did they have little actress O'Neal swallow a lemon before every scene. Just count her smiles, one finger will do. Well, whatever they did, it's a moppet performance unlike any I've seen. Great movie! The period re-creation strikes me as spot on, between the flivvers, dusty open roads, and pop 30's songs. All backdrop a tricky story that features a grown man getting a little girl started in a life of crime. Even selling phony, over-priced Bibles to widows, no less. Of course, it's not violent crime, but still. Anyway, the story's fashioned in such a charming way, you hardly notice. Then again, will Addy ever find out if Mose is her real daddy or not. And how about Madeline Kahn's chirpy bimbo, with a small bladder, no less. What a loss she was to the world of comedy.Good thing that headman Bogdanovich took Orson Welles' advice and filmed in b&w. I can't imagine the same period results in Technicolor. Anyway, the various parts come together in rich fashion, both amusing and poignant. And despite some critics, Tatum really did deserve an Oscar. I just hope she's found a lot to smile about in the meantime. Watching the movie, I certainly did.


                
Paper Moon shows us a simpler time, those Depression Era Thirties. In those days everyone was scratching for a dollar some less honestly than others like Ryan O'Neal. He plays a conman whose current scam is being a Bible salesman. Now could there be anything dishonest about a salesman of the Good Book? I won't describe his con, but it's a good one and in Middle America, Kansas of the Thirties, there's lots of suckers ready to be trimmed in this kind of scheme.But O'Neal gets a call on route that a woman he was intimately acquainted with has died. The 10 year old child she left behind could very well be O'Neal's.Ryan only agrees to deliver the girl to an aunt in St. Joseph, Missouri, but real life daughter Tatum kind of grows on him. And she certainly has his conning ways which would convince anyone she really is his daughter. She aids and abets him and comes up with some schemes of her own. Especially one involving Madeline Kahn who is a woman of some easy virtue who Ryan takes up with and Tatum can no way see as a mother figure.Paper Moon with its great musical score of 30s standards is my kind of film for that alone. But with real life father and daughter playing father and daughter on screen there's a special dimension for those really sublime and quality scenes. It's what earned Paper Moon it's Oscar for Tatum O'Neal as Best Supporting Actress. Doubly impressive since Madeline Kahn was also nominated. Paper Moon was also nominated for Best Sound and for Adapted Screenplay.In the cast you will really be surprised at John Hillerman's portrayal of a mean and corrupt redneck sheriff. It is such a far cry from being Higgins on Magnum, PI, Hillerman carries it off so well.I doubt in this day and age that Tatum and Ryan could have had the happy ending they did, but that's probably for the better. Still Paper Moon is nice nostalgic film about some less than honorable people.


                
Tatum O'Neal had this killer stare that would probably earn her a nice long prison sentence at the very least if looks could kill. Her maturity and her shrewdness in "business" as little Addie Prey was what made her pretty much steal this show. Also, when she looked in that cigar box and noticed all her money missing and she got that stare of hers going, I knew right away that someone was in for it. I definitely did not want to be in either daddy Ryan's or Madeline Kahn's shoes at that moment.This movie did a great job of recapturing the period it was trying to depict. Many reviewers have already said that they felt as if they were actually watching a 30s movie with the black and white cinematography and the landscape depicting depression-era America. I saw Peter Bogdanovich's interview and it tells how he went to great pains to make sure that every little detail was just as it might have been during that time. He did a super job with it. And the story was good, too. And it was kind of refreshing to see a child being portrayed as something other than a precocious cute little kid. Addie was every bit as strong-willed and cunning as Mose. in fact probably more so. She had Mose taking chances he otherwise wouldn't have taken and somehow always ended up on top of every sticky situation they got themselves into. And what director in this day and age would have the nerve to show a nine year old child driving a car and smoking cigarettes? I wasn't alive during the Depression, but my parents were, and I'm pretty sure this was the way kids acted back then. Great movie. Brings a smile to my face every time. By the way...I WANT MY $200!!!!!! Laugh out loud funny! :) 8 out of 10.


                
I wasn't born yet, but didn't the Sting come out in 1973 as well? Was the USA, as my clever title suggests, in love with Hobo-Esq inspired 1930s movies in the early 70s - those that highlighted grifting? Given the success of the both movies at the 1974 Oscars you would have to say yes (further, check out the Simpsons parody of grifting if you like the theme of these movies).Now Tatum O'Neil was great as Addie and her pa Jeff O'Neil did a great job a Mose. I loved Addies smoking and Mose's blindness to Trixie's obvious usury.However, I found the relationship between Addie and Mose a little more disturbing than most - perhaps this was the point of the movie. At times it really was more than fondness or kinship - Addie loved Mose - in a romantic way, or what she thought was romantic (which brought it out of the realm of disturbing). Given the fact that Mose could have been her Pa in real life, this had added a disturbing element to the movie. However, the movie needed the dark to balance the humour.Nevertheless, this movie was very easy to watch with great cinematography. Further, I loved how Addie wanted to help out FDR and redistribute here wealth - truly a child ahead of her times.
Just watched this for the first time in years. I didn't think I'd want to watch it again but I loved it when it came out in the 70's. I was in college and it brought back similar times. It did that again today. If you've never seen the movie, do so, it will make you feel good. I guarantee you will laugh. With a great cast and good plot how can you miss? Peter Bogdanovich proved himself a winner in black and white, with movies like Paper Moon and The Last Picture Show (now a trip into simpler times, but full of nostalgia for baby boomers) it's a wonder he does not get more credit. Same for Ryan O'Neil and Tatum. What a great team they made in this movie. What girl would not want to ride around the country with a handsome man she "prays" is her father selling bibles, passing twenties and trying to help others as they "help themselves". Also, watching Madeline Kahn was a delight. Fortunately we have this fun movie to watch her in. The movie some how manages to draw us in and hold our interest without any special effects, violence, gratuitous sex, or color. Next time you want to feel good or do something with your kids or grandkids - watch this movie.


                
This is such a good film. I didn't know what to expect but I got more than I bargained for. Tatum O'Neal steals the show with an excellent performance as Addy, an orphaned child who begins a road journey with a con man who is played with Oscar winning status by Ryan O'Neal. They play against each other well, being father and daughter in real life, and create some truly memorable scenes together including an excellent scene where Ryan O'Neal's character argues with the young girl Addy in a restaurant over money. It's a scene that manages to linger and proves the incredible filmmaking ability of Peter Bogdonavich who drives this film with incredible directing. The film is presented in a noir motif with 1930's visual and even a black and white presentation to further imrove the authenticity of the time period. Madeline Khan gives a brief but hilarious performance as a stipper who helps move the story into some great territory. Unfortunately, the story is muddled down in the second half with a less than satisfying ending that is cute, but completely off-set by the mood already established at the beginning. In spite of it all this is a truly entertaining and original piece of filmmaking.(***half our of **** stars)


                
In recent years, there have been countless movies about conmen. And there have been plenty of movies about fathers in questionable occupations that are reunited with their daughters. But this movie's simplicity has them all beat. Maybe because Ryan and Tatum O'Neal are also real life father and daughter, it's easy to believe them in this movie. This was Tatum's first movie and she deservedly won the Oscar for it...the youngest person to win an Academy Award. Filmed in black & white, this film had a good look. Along with an appropriate soundtrack made it easy to believe it was back in the 1930's.***1/2 (Out of 4)


                
Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neal) is at her mother's burial. Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal) shows up and is persuaded to deliver her to her aunt in Missouri. Moses is a con man who dated Addie's mother and is possibly her father. He get $200 for her death but uses half to fix his own car. She demands to get the full $200 and he reluctantly agrees to earn the money to give her. They travel on the road where Addie learns Moses' con tricks. They pick up carnival dancer Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn) at one stop. At another, they con the wrong bootlegger and is hunted by Sheriff Hardin (John Hillerman).The stark black and white visual by Peter Bogdanovich is beautiful. There is a little bit of violence, a good dose of desperation and a large amount of plucky little girl acting. It's an appealing mixture. The fact that Tatum was an amateur does show but it actually adds to her performance. There is an earnestness about it and the chemistry is terrific.


                
I was surprised at how good this film was, it wasnt too dated, the actors didnt overact, and it wasnt overly silly.  The cast was also very nice, nice to see Randy Quaid(The Vacation Movies) in one of his first film appearences.  Ryan O'Neal usually annoys me, but he was OK here.  If you like movies, especially from the 70's, see this one.  **** out of *****.


                
Enjoyable trip through depression America with period music, a funny script, and excellent black and white photography.  The O'Neals (father and daughter) are funny, convincing, and not overly sentimental.  I didn't think that much of Khan's bit.  Excellent con-family fun.
