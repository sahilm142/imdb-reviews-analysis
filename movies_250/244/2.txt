As a children's movie, this movie fails utterly. It is way too serious, children's movies should have some humour in them, and this one doesn't. The beast is always scary, and never is likeable. And the musical aspect of this movie is just infuriatingly annoying; a Disney feature-length cartoon is to some extent expected be a musical, but they just took that concept way too far in this one, almost every major scene is carried out in song; one bad song after another.I don't know who is giving this movie such high marks, I know it certainly can't be children. Avoid this movie, some of the later Disney movies do much better at the humour aspect, such as Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, Hercules, etc.


                
DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE IN IMAX!!!  IMAX tickets are more expensive than regular film and this movie was never in intended to be viewed on an IMAX screen.  The first five minutes of the film are incredible, because it is an entirely new sequence made just for the IMAX version and there are no moving animations just fades and zooms of still shots.  The animation is choppy at best and flat out random images flashing on the screen at worst. It's so bad at times it will give you a headache.  In the fight scene with the Beast and the wolves, all you saw were flashes of the Beast's body parts with wolves appearing and disappearing at random.  It's like watching TV with your nose only an inch from the screen.  What you can see is the lack of detail in the characters and almost monochrome appearance to all of the colors in the characters(i.e. all of the colors appear as a single shade there are no gradients).  You can't see that in the regular film because it is much smaller.In short the film does not have enough resolution or the depth needed for the IMAX experience.  Rent the video or wait for it on DVD; you'll be much happier.
