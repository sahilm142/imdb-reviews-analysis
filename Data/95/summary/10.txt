 People seem to be missing the point

 Who the hell is Christoph Waltz?

 Waltz is a Genius!!!!!

 No Matter How You Spell It

 Brave, unique and just sheer brilliant!

 Tarantino Delivers!!!

 Who are you calling a basterd?

 Inglorious? Quite the opposite in fact

 Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction - I absolutely loved it.

 Brilliantly offbeat wartime western

 A Unique Masterpiece from Tarantino

 Words as weaponry

 a master popularizer at his very best

 Movies about movies

 1 star reviews of this film are wrong

 Basically it's Tarantino's worst film!

 Supremely dark fun

 Incredible, Tarantino is a genius

 Inglourious Basterds

 Brutal and Delicious

 Oh my god they killed history! You Basterds!

 Brilliant.

 Pulp Fiction goes France in WW 2

 Exhilarating

 At last, a real return to form
