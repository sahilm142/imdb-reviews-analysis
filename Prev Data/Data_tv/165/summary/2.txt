 Good Psychological Thriller

 Fckin A

 Amazing experience - best TV series of Turkish television history

 Nobody is Innocent

 Masum/Innocent

 Highly Overrated Strictly No for Mystery Fans

 TV masterpiece at a fraction of the budget of your HBO show

 High Quality, Intelligent Drama

 Impressive and confusing

 Incredibly stupid TV series... What a waste of time

 Overrated

 I enjoyed all 7 episodes! And the finale was a disappointment

 Somtimes exciting, sometimes confusing

 Great acting. (Spoilers)

 Fine but not a Masterpiece
