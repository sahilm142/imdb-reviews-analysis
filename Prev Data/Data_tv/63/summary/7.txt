 Lost it's touch years ago

 The greatest TV show....the first 9 seasons anyway.

 The Simpsons isn't what it used to be

 Am I the only one who thinks that this show sucks lately?

 A Show That Should've Never Entered the 21st Century. Better than South Park, though.

 It was terrific for the first ten years...

 Gradually lost it's touch. But still very good.

 Witty, funny and lovable family comedy, sadly going downhill

 9.0 Seasons Then Minus The Rating And Remaining Seasons

 "miss hoover i got my head stuck to my shoulder"

 Just good

 A Funny American Classic

 Show is Still On?!

 Nostalgia

 good

 Great Show.... Before 2000

 Overdone

 A good show but it doesn't seem to be appealing to me.
