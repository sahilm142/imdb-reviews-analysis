 Beautifully crafted and enjoyable series

 Could have been great

 The Man They Call Jayne

 Wow

 It's an absolute disgrace that this was cancelled

 Whedon's masterpiece

 Joss continues to amaze

 I can't believe it only ran one season

 One of the best Sci-Fi series ever, killed by some of the worst Studio Executives EVER!

 Original, Unique and timeless

 Networks can be very, very stupid!

 Serenity

 a small but brilliant gem

 One of the best shows you've never seen

 One of the best TV series ever made

 It's Reputation Precedes It, And For Good Reason.

 Why doesn't the ''Establishment'' like Joss?

 One word that sums up the series:

 Their love made it work

 Stay Away. Heartbreak Alert.

 Western or Sci-Fi? Both and good at it!

 Firefly is FLIPPING MAGIC!!!!!

 This series should NEVER have been canceled!

 Masterpiece cut down

 One of the Best Shows on TV
