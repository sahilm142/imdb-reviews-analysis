First of all I know this is American drama and that emotions are a key component of such products. Second, I expect the characters to be somewhat believable and somewhat likable. While most comments on IMDb that dislike this program are about the perceived left-wing bias, my criticism is that all the characters seem to be on day-release from intense psychotherapy. If they are not, they certainly should be getting therapy. Everybody seems unable to deal with who they are, and what others do around them. Everyone gets upset at the slightest action of another. Everyone is either maudlin, fearful, or angst-ridden. They have the emotional response of emo teenagers. And this does not for good drama make. You have to care about characters in order to be involved and feel for them. Instead, we are subjected to children in big bodies who are eminently unlovable. This is the worst of American drama. While I understand that HBO made this for an American audience, it is so self-absorbed as to make Paris Hilton look positively interesting. The newsroom? Oooh! Television! Wow. And people get upset! Fascinating. And there are real stories as well. I mean real stories! How can you not want to watch it? It's not even boring, it's painfully masturbatory. It is so full of its own self-importance as be an exercise in politics. While some might like it because it is 'socially relevant' the script means that you are constantly being subjected to trauma. Ugh!


                
When I saw the first episodes I thougth WOW, what a fantastic new show, the covering of all the dramatic events in the past years, the research behind it and how a news channel works was very interesting and entertaining. I guess this is also the reason why all the positive reviews here are from June, because the show was really good back then. Sadly it changed after the first episodes and now it is only a Republican bashing show which has some love stories going on to add some drama. All these love stories are pathetic....come on.....also Mackenzie sometimes acts like a 12 year old....and what the hell why are the Republicans and the Tea Party the ONLY topic in this show?? No one believes that Will is a true Republican, this fact should just make the bashing legal because he is one of them....but its just embarrassing. I really can say this because I'm not from USA, I'm not a Democrat nor a Republican and for me as a neutral viewer this is already extremely annoying.So I really don't know why the show got renewed.....the show has soooo much potential if they had concentrated on NEWS!! and not only Republicans. Normally I'M a huge fan of HBO series but this....Its a shame to waste all this potential.....


                
Sorkin seems to have two modes of writing; insightful, intelligent, witty or Didactic, condescending, overwrought. Unfortunately The Newsroom is an example of the second of these Sorkins. I have a love affair with The West Wing and rewatch the entire series every couple years to remind me how good writing for TV can be. I think he can be one of the smartest, most intelligent writers alive today. But his tendency to fall off a cliff of self-righteousness has brought more than one of his shows to a sudden stop.Newsroom seems to want to be very sincere in it's attempt to make the American public less dumb by quoting facts and figures while pontificating, at great length, about what's wrong with the way that you think. They set up straw-men that are 2 dimensional caricatures of wrong thinking, then set about knocking them down self-righteously. It tends to make the main characters on the show look not like high-minded journalists, but intellectual bullies. I mean really, a beauty queen to defend some conservative legislation? That's a real hard-won victory.It actually has the opposite effect that they seem to so earnestly desire, to speak truth to power and edify our fellow citizens. The journalists seem so intent on speaking truth that they appear uninterested in anything that someone else might have to say. They speak AT each other rather than engage in discourse.I won't even go into the broad acting that seems better suited to stage than screen, or the thinly written characters that populate the show. If they can just fix the breast beating and condescension the show would be, barely, watchable. Without making some serious changes to the basic premise of the show I don't see how it can't be another Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.Any resemblance between this show and real journalism is purely coincidental.


                
I am a big Sorkin fan. I really enjoyed West Wing and Studio 60. Sportsnight was one of my all time favorite shows. I eagerly awaited the debut of his new show Newsroom. I anticipated his usually quick humor through the use of real and complex characters. However, I am really disappointed by Newsroom. The scripts have become a "Designing Woman"(for those who remember that show) monologue. Beating us over the head with constant one sided opinions shows a lack of deep thought and character development. I know it is a political year, but I was hoping Sorkin would use the rich acting talent to explore moral issues without simplistic and trite writing.


                
I don't think I've ever seen a show begin so well, and then descend into utter banality so quickly - in the span of only two episodes. It usually takes a series years.If the second episode is any indication of the trajectory of this show, then someone at HBO, please kill it now. Aaron Sorkin has a gift in that he can write political dramas with as much heart as Salinger's Esmé. But I honestly don't know what he was thinking trying to replay the West Wing formula for the post-Bush, post-Bailout, borderline revolution America we live in now.In the age of Twitter, Youtube and a media consolidation that has reduced eighty global media companies down to six in just 30 years, does he really believe we need a fantasy about about what would happen if a news anchor decided to "get real?" And what is a real news anchor anyway? Because the pitch for News Night 2.0 bore a strong resemblance to the Jim Lehrer News Hour. "Experts" on both sides? You mean from establishment outlets like think tanks and elite foundations.Sounds like a rerun to me.While I didn't buy all of Will's rant in the first ten minutes of the first episode, it was an extremely powerful moment of TV. And it would have been interesting to see that sort of Jerry McGuire moment play out in the weeks ahead. But instead of this wonderful, life changing epiphany, driving multiple fronts of conflict and consequence through a highly dramatic season, The Newsroom devolved into a kind of cutesy, shallow, 30-something soap opera.But even on those terms, it doesn't work. What was Allison Pill's character supposed to be? Appealing? To whom, people who enjoy pain and suffering? And how dumb is the intended audience supposed to be to buy the whole asterisk before the email ridiculousness. It was embarrassing.At least my concerns have been allayed somewhat that this would be some kind of propaganda device for the corporate media to show us how hard it is being "serious" all the time. After all, Sorkin's talents could be dangerous. But if this is the state of propaganda these days, I think we're safe.


                
This show is sooooo over rated. Emily Mortimer and Alison Pill are the 2 worst characters on the show with their ridiculous dialog. The "witty" back and forths they have with their co-workers is so unrealistic that it makes me roll my eyes every time they speak. Not sure if I can stick with this one much longer. I don't think this was a very good comeback for Sorkin. Time will tell if this series remains on the air. I hate the way Maggie and Jim like each other but play it off like 2 year olds. Some of the other moments of this show such as Neal's Bigfoot theory are equally ridiculous.Oh well, seems like this show has snowed enough people to give it a ridiculously high rating.


                
Earth to Aaron - PEOPLE DON'T TALK LIKE THIS!Sorry, but the dialog here flows with all the honesty and truthfulness of an Alastair MacLean thriller, running the gamut of being leaden to being too smart by half, often within a sentence.I'm a lifelong liberal, but this show rings no more true than does your typical Chuck Norris movie.The producers seem to have realized their problems after the first couple of episodes, and have - predictably - resorted to office romance subplots to move things along.Perhaps the producers also realized that the premise of their show was harder to pull off over multiple episodes than they first envisioned. That might account for their going with the office romance subplots.Aaron the Emperor has no clothes.Predictable, stereotypical and - ultimately - unwatchable.


                
Having spent nearly 20 years in the media in a former life, I was eagerly looking forward to this show. My friends in the field and I used to talk about a TV show that looked behind the scenes of the media in a serious way, and it was exciting to see the idea come to fruition.What a disappointment. The show has turned out to be nothing more than a weekly diatribe against Republicans. Yes, there are some nods to the mechanics of producing a news broadcast, but the thrust of the program is clearly coming from a partisan political perspective with the goal of pushing that perspective with great verve no matter what.Worse, anchor Will McEvoy is portrayed as a "Republican" who is troubled by the Tea Party (my goodness, do they put time and effort into bashing THAT group on this show) and soothes his conflicted agendas by slamming the GOP and the Tea Party with non-stop, ferocious intensity. The character is clearly nothing more than a token who is being used to make political points. It's insulting to think the producers of this show think we're going to buy this.Full disclosure: I'd agree with the surveys that indicate roughly 85% of the media is liberal, and so in that way I suppose the show is demonstrating some accuracy. The staff of this newscast are also fairly typical in that they all think of themselves as on some kind of holy Truth Crusade and don't even realize how their political feelings are coloring their news gathering and reporting.That said, at its core we're provided with nothing more than ham-handed partisan political ideology. And goodness knows, there's already more than enough of that on the television and radio from both goofy ends of the political spectrum..
I wish Jeff Daniels wouldn't have come out as an out and out lib by signing up for this show, or that its writer(s) could've saved a bit more face by portraying events factually. It seems that when it comes to the truth about politics, Hollywood still pretends that one side is screwing us harder than the other, and it's sad really, because the dialogue is so well written! I thought perhaps HBO might produce a show that finally represents how most people feel and view the situation; that's what I get for wishful thinking.The writers express what the spin that would have been most effective would've been like had the reporters for the left-wing media outlets had the hindsight afforded by months of retrospect. I feel that Hollywood has lost touch with the majority of Americans when it comes to politics, and its attempts to marginalize dissent as radical only further polarizes the average person. If you're looking for a show that does its best to "rock the boat," and you seem to think Obama has done well, then this show is for you.


                
The cinematography is crisp, the actors are famous, it looks and feels like a good tv show. it even starts off with main character saying something outrageous, making us believe the show will be either edgy or the character will find a way to fix things he disagrees with, and find inner peace.instead of that, it's just a will they, won't they type of story. there's nothing edgy about it, and great intro speech fizzles out by the time second episode starts, and nothing extraordinary happens past that. They all act like we have this extraordinary group of people working to bring us news, but really, they are just bunch of mediocre reporters that never touch on topics of consequence.the moment you think: "oh, this will be good" like when they finally turn out to be covering global warming, it turns out that guy who gave them interview is doomsday guy, and they dismiss him, and never talk about him again, except to put down the jurno who brought him in, even tho, ironically, everything he said was gonna happen, is already happening.then there's a moment when a big bad hacker "steals bunch of government documents" and sends them to them, but all documents look like news paper clippings... what? how is someone public enemy for sharing news papers clippings?the most annoying thing is probably that the lead declares himself to be a republican, only so that he could bash republicans every chance he gets. I mean, I don't have a problem with republicans being ridiculed when they are acting ridiculous, but democrats are also equally bad and preposterous, and if you want to make character come off as balanced, then make him undecided and bashing both sides.another thing that made me roll my eyes, was their coverage of occupy wall street. basically the only complaint he had about OWS, was that it was leaderless movement. sure OWS failed, but only cause police chased them away, and didn't let them gather again. it had nothing to do with there being no leader. what was leader supposed to do? instigate them to fight the police? pure nonsensein the end everyone that was ogling eachother ended up together, no conclusion was reached, nothing changed, and nothing was achieved. complete waste of time.the reason I give it two stars instead of one, is the intro speech, first half of which was likable (should have known this won't dare reach any conclusions from the second half of it)
Reviewing only the Pilot, since i didn't even make it through the first episode. The only intent of this review is to save as much people as possible from spending any time and money on this. You can rule out any political bias in my review, i will only address the poor characters and dialogue.The opening scene had me hooked instantly, Macavoys monologue was great, the production value seemed top, i was looking forward towards great TV Entertainment.What a letdown.The Dialogues and Characters in this show might be the worst i have ever witnessed. It started with the first scene of Alison Pill and the Producer guy discussing meeting her parents, in the middle of their workspace. No one talks like that, Soaps like Gossip Girl portrait human Interactions more accurately than this.At first i simply could not believe it, how anyone can ruin a show like that.Every actor is blathering without taking a breath. This works in a Woody Allen Movie, in some RomComs maybe, but in this surrounding it appears pathetic. I sincerely hoped, that those two were just "accidents" but it just continued to be that bad. If you enjoy Shows like Justified, Mad Men, Breaking Bad etc. do not watch this. If you are an intelligent human being, do not watch this.I am aware, that different shows attract different audiences. I can not explain any positive review of this show, neither to my self, nor to you.


                
By the fourth episode of Season 1, you start to sense that this isn't your usual 'docudrama". By the eight episode, it's clear that Sorkin has set you up to be bombarded by anti-Republican rhetoric ... all the subtlety is gone. As Season 1 progresses, you realize this is just another Republican-bashing, liberal cause piece. By Episode 10, it's a "full-on" political work by the left-leaning elitist arts' establishment .... think Al Franken on steroids. Certainly the script comes from the DNC. Don't the major networks do enough of this on the evening news?Jeff Daniels, who I usually don't like and I thought was, at best a "B" actor, is on his "A" game.


                
I came across this show purely by accident. I watched a clip on YouTube called "why America is not the greatest country in the world" That statement made me curious what this show was all about. If it can get away, opening with something ballsy like that. I gotta check out the rest of the show. So I got a hold of all seasons, and was some what pleased by he end of the first one.. It wasn't as critical or edge cutting as it pretended to be in the first ep.but I figured it would pick up by season two and three.But turned out what could have been great potential, was all gone, and things were spiraling downhill from there. They build up to a big climax that never comes. Whenever they get close to something that looks like a breaking story, they have to compromise,which means not run it at all, or the story turns out to be false. 90% of season two and three is about romance in the office and the remaining 10 is split between battling with the network bosses, and pursuing something that could be breaking news. They shout and talk over each other all the time. I don't doubt a newsroom is chaotic, but if a newsroom was like this,they would never get things done.And there are too much dialog and monologues,that never really goes anywhere.For Example :One of the workers talks endlessly about Bigfoot through an entire episode,he breaks in every now and than with some nonsense about Bigfoot and they are not doing a story on the subject either.Which leaves you wondering WTF that was all aboutAnother thing, whenever someone opens their mouth to speak its never a simple dialog. it's an endless speech, just to tell you that you have to make a right at the corner to get where you going. The excitement just isn't there.One thing that bothered me a lot, was all the talk about journalism integrity.But not one of them have the balls/integrity to resign in protest over having to dump a major story,just cause the network exec's are afraid of bad press or sponsor withdrawal. Yet they continue with the big speeches.The only people you see get fired, or have to quit are the extras.***************spoilers*************Spoilers******************* the two things that really made me mad was two particular episodes.The first one; was when they can get the chief's son, who been riding their back,making life difficult for them. Thrown in jail for breaking several laws.By proving he has been hacking famous peoples phones,including people at the newsroom(think news of the world hacking scandal).Just so he can make money selling stories about them,to a gossip magazine he owns stocks in. They don't do it.They go for a compromise instead,just so he can continue to F*ck with their lives.Another one was when they got a hold of the wikileaks,they make a big number of Will going to jail for not revealing the source.But in the end their leaders didn't dare print it anyway out of fear from government repercussions. They should have made it into a what if scenario.What if the news had printed them,or published them on the net.


                
The minute you see 'Written by Aaron Sorkin' come up at the start of any TV programme or film you know exactly what you're getting. Lots of quick paced dialogue, lots of even faster walking down corridors but also great characters and plots that have the ability to make you both think,pull at your heart-strings and sometimes laugh.The Newsroom features all those elements and more but as was pointed out last year, Sorkin loves to reuse character types and situations and having watched The West Wing and Studio 60 it's both fun and annoying to see very similar characters again. Especially if you prefer the original version.However Sorkin's talent is undeniable and although The Newsroom is not a perfect show it is a darn sight better than most of the other shows on TV. My only real complaint is that there is a fair bit of swearing, some of which is just not needed. If Sorkin is painting these characters as being so smart why do they need to keep swearing every so often to make their point?Overall, if you like the work of Sorkin then this series will be something you check out but if you're not a fan you'll find nothing to alter your opinion. For me The Newsroom feels like Sorkin trying to get some of the flaws he made in Studio 60 right second time around and I preferred the original attempt.
