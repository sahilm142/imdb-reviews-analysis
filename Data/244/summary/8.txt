 Drishyam: A Perfect movie for ending my tiring Thursday

 Exceptional Piece of Writing

 This visual is DEEPLY DECEPTIVE

 Drishyam -- No one is guilty in the eyes of law till proved !

 Best movie of 2015

 "Ma'am, this family is even tougher than we thought!"

 Brilliant movie.

 Well made copies

 An astonishing script supported with great cinematography and direction

 There is a loophole in the movie. Vijay Salgaonkar's finger prints on that car have not been checked for.

 A neatly packed thriller

 Must watch Thriller with Great Suspense and End

 Amazing Movie

 Terrific!!!

 Grand Deception

 A Touch of Hollywood Style

 Give it a watch

 Edge of the seat thriller!!!

 Strong, realistic n brilliant with one unrealistic scene

 Just bookish knowledge does not train one for challenge called life.

 Great Movie . Length Kills

 Good riddance to bad rubbish & no one punished!

 One of finest film of Indian Cinema! Go watch It!
