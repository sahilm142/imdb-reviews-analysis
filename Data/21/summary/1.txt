 I'm losing my credit for IMDb rates

 A violent cartoon

 Not worth the hype

 Shallow and senseless

 Dazzling, dizzying, but ultimately just another shoot-em-up

 Unnecessary disturbing scenes, only desensitize people can stomach this movie,

 Too slick for its own good

 I want two hours of my life back

 Extremely violent movie

 Cheap and disgusting, trying to pass for art

 Impressive but irresponsible

 Overrated so so much

 disturbing, shocking, sick

 You have to be kidding me!

 big No No

 The worst film i ever saw in my entire life
