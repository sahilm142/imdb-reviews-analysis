I tried. But these are just boring, and utterly lacking in entertainment value. I could only get through 1,2 and 6. I'd had enough after 1 and 2, then tried to be fair by watching the highest rated 6. I rated them a 1,2, and 3 respectively.The people that rave about this series are laughable. Who cares about clever subtlety's and mind tricks if the stories are trash? I'm not watching a movie in Sunday school or taking an advanced film class. What I want most is a good story. And this series surely does not deliver that in the slightest.So go ahead and call me names from behind your bible or atop your high horse. At least I'm not the one eating a spectacularly designed turd sandwich.
