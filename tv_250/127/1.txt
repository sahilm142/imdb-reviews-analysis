I know this is a pretty unpopular opinion, but I hate Peep Show. I remember watching it months ago because I loved watching That Mitchell and Webb Look back when they were making new episodes and wanted to see what else they've been doing on TV, needless to say I was pretty disappointed.I was coming into it expecting the clever, witty humour that so many people were hyping it up for and found it to be the opposite: the script was very much lacking in subtlety and wit and it felt like the writers didn't have a wide enough vocabulary to put emphasis in the dialogue without resorting to using the word "F!@#", it was so bad that I think I heard it being said in every other line of dialogue being spoken.Another thing that I hated about the show (that is related to the previous point) was the overuse of shock humour (which can actually be good if used the right way), I'll be darned if they had shown a scene in that entire episode that wasn't about sex or drugs (or both) and didn't have the characters swearing like drunken pirates in some lame attempt to be "edgy".In conclusion: Crass, over-hyped and barely relatable in any way to my life. To paraphrase Public Enemy: "Don't Believe the Hype"
