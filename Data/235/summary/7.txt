 Minny Don't Burn Chicken

 Disney's Help

 Good but a missed opportunity

 Good but the book was way better

 This Should Receive Oscar Nominations, And It Deserves Them

 Good but Not as Good as It Could Have Been

 The acting was great

 A moving drama and an inspiring story

 MY REVIEW: Help Yourself, Watch This Good One!!

 A great mosaic of well-developed characters and good performances

 If You Ask Me, I'll Vote For The Book.... <U+2666> 69%

 Maid to order

 The ultimate chick flick

 Well worth the watch!

 Comedy, drama and characters who walk Hollywood's high rope.

 Humble Help -- So Hard To Find, These Days.

 Less like The Color Purple and more like Green Fried Tomatoes

 The Courage To Believe

 Is this real life or just some fantasy?

 Maids Matter

 It's a good movie

 The help

 Good cast in typical feel-good story

 ....it is good to say something.. and as well to make lots doing so

 predictability saved by the power of female acting chops, especially Viola Davis
