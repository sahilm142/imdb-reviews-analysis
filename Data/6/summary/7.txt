 don't take this personally

 My first Review

 Fascinating tale about the hope of life and the promise of safety linked to one man and several thousand others, unfolding amongst an ocean of carnage.

 how one man made a difference

 Great Movie

 Some thoughts

 It may be the most important film you'll ever see...

 Courageous film from Spielberg

 Extraordinary pictures - not so great script

 A heart warming tale of mass murder and genocide

 A daily comment from Midget Emma: Schindler's List (1993)

 Greatly Overrated Movie

 The More I See It The Less I Like It

 Technically it's perfect and often it's very moving, but I wouldn't call it a 'masterpiece'

 a very enlightening film

 Emotional, but lacking.

 Jewish Propaganda.

 A very entertaining yet flawed film

 suffers from the Spielberg-syndrom

 Powerfully disturbing film with lack of credibility/unnecessary storyline of Oskar Schindler

 Good topic, but too hard to follow

 Overrated but still worth watching

 A powerful, moving masterpiece. The most meaningful and emotional film ever made.

 A bit long

 Has many flaws
