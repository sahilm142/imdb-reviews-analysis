 Park Chan-wook crafts another masterpiece!

 Not Old Boy, but that's OK

 Blue is the Warmest Color + Oldboy = The Handmaiden

 Cinema at its Finest and a Commentary

 A beautiful erotic crime thriller

 A great female empowerment love story!

 The Handmaiden

 "A story is all about the journey"

 Riveting, Surprising, Complex, Beautiful and oh so Passionate!

 A masterwork of cinema that is both sexually manipulative and ruthlessly violent

 An absolutely psychotic but exhilarating film

 Great, great film

 Park Chan-wook's Finest Since 'Oldboy'. Dark, Twisted & Deliciously Thrilling.

 How to react to expectatives

 Not just a period drama about lesbians

 Utopian!

 Very Asian, very erotic, very interesting, British?!

 top notch film making

 More accessible than Oldboy

 Victorian England is traded for colonial Korea –a country writhing under Japanese oppression –The altering of the plot is done in such remarkable aspects, perfectly!

 Jade Is the Warmest Color?

 Masterpiece

 A demonstration in mastering the codes of cinema

 I would like to thank the film gods for giving us Park Chan-Wook.
