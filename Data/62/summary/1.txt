 A movie that shoots itself

 Murder, hate and boredom - what's not to like?

 Ego driven mess

 An all time new low for all involved

 Smell a rat?

 How about we all get honest?

 Walked out of this truly disgusting revolting movie

 Anti-White Trash

 As always, too violent

 Another stupid overlong Tarantino-Miramax Oscar prone garbage.

 This Pulp Is The Worst Fiction Ever Made

 One of the best profanity movies of the year

 DON'T WASTE YOUR Time and $$$!!! (Possible Spoilers)

 Again: what is happening to the great American directors?

 Worst Tarantino EVER...

 A disturbing insight into the perversity of our age

 Twisted violence from an overrated director with nothing new to say

 Revenge, violence, torture and hatred glorification.

 Blazing Saddles Unchained

 a big bore

 An obnoxious, racist screed of pre-civil war history

 just plain awful!

 Pure manure...

 Awful

 This time Tarantino goes too far...WAY TOO FAR!!
