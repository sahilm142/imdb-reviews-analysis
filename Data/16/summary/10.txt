 Both uplifting and disheartening, sometimes both at once

 Touching and moving, a great cinematic experience

 A great order vs. chaos tale that everyone can relate to

 "What an excellent movie" is all that went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece

 Poetic - Powerful - Simple: The Greatness of Cuckoo's Nest.

 Best film of its era

 One Flew Over One of the Best Movies Ever Made!!! (And that person was me)

 A masterpiece

 One of the greatest movies and life lessons of all time

 Get Mad If You Want To! This Is Very Realistic!

 Jack Nicholson's best yet!

 The Ultimate Backfire

 (In)sane

 You would have to be crazy not to watch this movie.

 A wonderful film

 Extraordinary

 Flawless as an example of cinematic craft; unparalleled as an examination of corruption and how the mind works.

 Best movie ever

 reasons why I love One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
