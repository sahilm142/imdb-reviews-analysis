 I feel sorry for the kid, but

 definition of a bad movie

 the guy needs a good shrink

 Awful

 I will never trust IMDb again.

 pseudo-intellectual movie for pseudo-intellectuals

 selfish, emotionally fetal boy takes off without letting anyone who has ever cared about him know and "plays" for the rest of his life.

 Bad movie about self discovery

 What Is The Point?

 Horribly and sadly misguided...

 Chris McCandless was an idiot and he died like one.

 Stupid life of a loser

 Okay, what's good about this movie?

 Disappointing and Lacking

 A bad movie about a bad person

 Hipper-than-thou, entitled brat becomes a "Beg-Packing" hobo and punishes his long-suffering parents in Sean Penn's tedious vanity project

 questionable message

 boring, it insist upon itself!

 A very sad romanticized movie of a bad decision maker

 a guy who couldn't manage his emotions.. runs away

 Total waste of time

 a nice tale for the dreamers

 Cliché all the way

 Self-aware movie about self-absorbed idiot

 An 8 are you kidding!?! I give it a 2.
