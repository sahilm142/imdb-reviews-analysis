 Mediocre people reward mediocre cinema.

 An "O.K." Movie, Worshiped Because of It's Accessibility.

 unoriginal prison movie

 Terrifyingly Overrated

 Cliche

 my backlash vote

 On the world's finest films

 Am i missing something??

 Most Overrated Film of All Time

 The plain & simple truth. It doesn't deserve to be at #2.

 Didactic and overlong

 After a big buildup, a real disappointment

 Proof That The Internet Can Be Misleading

 A good movie but definitely not #2 of all time

 What's all the fuss about?

 Not the greatest movie of all time

 A sociopath prison warden, sadistic guard as well as cuddly and misunderstood inmates.

 very average

 Sugary sentimental and unsatisfying

 Pale imitation of better films

 snarling critique

 More like The SHAM-shank Redemption - SPOILER

 Why?

 The bathos runs thick

 what is all the fuss about
