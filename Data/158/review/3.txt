Personally, I think that comedy and horror are the hardest genres in cinema. Maybe that is because its very hard to amuse me, but still I think that comedies are always too idiotic to be good or they are just too boring to good. General belongs to the latter category. I don´t think that a man simply fooling around is funny, no matter what the critics might say or no matter if that man happens to be Buster Keaton. The Civil War is just a frame, within Buster can do his so called acrobatic tricks. I like black and white films as well as silent movies, but also my tolerance has it´s limits, I cannot like a movie only because it´s said to be a classic.
