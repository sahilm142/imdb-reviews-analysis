 Season 13 awful

 It's Good. It's Always Good

 A must watch

 the dumbest live action characters on any TV show ever

 If you liked Arrested Development, give this a try.

 Writing this Review After Watching 6 Seasons

 The Gang Maintains Quality

 Weird, crazy, stupid funniest show

 New season is boring

 One of my favorite TV Shows except some technical errors
