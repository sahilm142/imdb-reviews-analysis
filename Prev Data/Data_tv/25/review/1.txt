I never cared for this show.  I watched it when I was little, but it never was anything really good.  People say it's one of the best cartoons ever, but that couldn't be further from the truth.  First, the animation sucked. It was pretty bad to look at, as the characters looked really choppy. Second, the a lot of the stories were ripped off from the original comics. Third, the music was also a horrible, chopped up version of Danny Elfman's original score.  Still, this was a better cartoon than the show that premired a few months later, Marvel's horrible X-men cartoon.BOTTOM LINE:  I prefer Superman, Spider-man(2003), and Justice League.  This show was never as good as all of those people said it was.  Plus, if you want a real contender for, "GREATEST CARTOON EVER," look under Transformers.
