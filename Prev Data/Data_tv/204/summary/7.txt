 RIP Andy

 Some good some not so ...

 Can't wait for season 2

 Starts off weak and slow but grows fast and furious.

 Entertaining but Historically Inaccurate

 A frank depiction of the Roman underclass

 Do i feel two different series here?

 Not quite to the heights of the first year

 Really good, with a few flaws

 Enjoyable with the potential to be annoying

 Season 1 > season 2

 A good 'original' TV series, but NOT for the faint-hearted or easily offended.

 Physically beautiful characters set in dynamic situations

 FIRST SEASON HITS HOME THE OTHER SUCKED!

 Would be great - if they put some clothes on
