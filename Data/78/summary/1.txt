 Revenge of the Teddy Bears

 What a trashy, sell-out piece of unadulterated crap

 Fart Jokes and Gumby and Ewoks...Oh No!

 Very Disappointed

 Continuing the tradition of excruciating dialogue and complete lack of subtlety...

 lame

 One of the worst films to hold a spot on IMDb's top 250 list.

 This movie sucks

 What an awful film

 The End that sends you reeling

 JEDI: Following a sad, predictable pattern of 3rd installments...

 The extremely blatant plot-holes makes it unwatchable

 C rating for a B movie = 0. lame acting, dialogue, muppet show

 Another Pretentious Mess from The King of Crap
