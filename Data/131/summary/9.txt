 No one can Review this Film, we can only hope to Analyze it

 Chaotic n hilarious. Wendy Carlos' music from Clockwork... at the murder scene was top notch.

 Decade's Best : Redefines Neo-Noir

 Content and Talent shines over everything else

 Andhadhun -simply mind blowing

 Finally a perfect Psychological Thriller

 Brilliant acting by Ayushmann!

 A near perfect Dark Comedy

 Darn Interesting!

 Magnus opus Story.....

 The only thing I hated was the Intermission - Andhadhun is a class Act!

 Sriram Raghavan is the modern day Alfred Hitchcock

 Masterpiece from Bollywood ..

 Befitting the title - Andhadhun

 After long- a good "Noir" movie!

 Mindblowing film

 It is the movie which we deserve

 "What is life? It depends on the liver."

 Not watching this one is a crime

 Probably the Best Indian Film i've watched so far

 Quirky Movie. Quirky Tribute. It's a Ripper

 Impressive Plot

 Bollywood scores again

 Masterpiece...Best of decade...

 Masterflick of shriram Raghavan
