 Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish

 While brimming with great actors, scenes, and styles, Tarantino mangles the tonally inconsistent third act

 Highly Entertaining For Adults

 Highly Entertaining and Funny

 Tarantino at his finest!

 Hilarious, uncompromisingly brutal, but delivers on all fronts

 Many lovely details and an outstanding acting disarm the mediocre story

 Tarantino Unchained – ein Regisseur schlägt wieder über die Stränge

 One of the best!

 Django Unchained (2012)

 Mostly Standard Recent Tarantino Revenge Fantasy

 Tarantino misfires so bad

 Over indulgent, gross....but also terrific.

 Very good, but a little short of being a masterpiece

 Wunderbar.....

 Strong performance out of the tradition of The Princess Bride

 shocking view of slavery through the Spaghetti Western

 An entirely satisfying and quintessentially Tarantino film

 Great action & drama in which DiCaprio stands out

 Django Unchained is a film that will stand in the hall of fame with history's greatest westerns

 Entertaining and witty movie...85%

 A Star

 The bad "reviews" make me sad.

 Short comment

 A milestone in Tarantino's filmography
