 Lyrical and beautifully crafted, I respected it more than i necessarily enjoyed it

 Good, but not a masterpiece

 Life lessons

 "My kingdom may be small but at least I'm king here."

 Good movie. But not for every palate.

 A movie in slow motion

 Art film has its moments, but is not for the casual film-goer

 Good, but not that good

 This Turkish delight you don't wanna miss
