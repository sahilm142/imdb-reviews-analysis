 Not up to my expectations

 Did nothing for me

 Impossible to follow or enjoy--what a big disappointment.

 Wow, this is the cutest ugly/mean film I've ever seen !

 Big budget, big cast, big disappointment

 A Journey to Nowhere

 For Anderson fans only

 What were the noted actors thinking?

 Femm-ey guys mincing about wearing moustaches

 Slept Through About 40% of This Hyper Acclaimed Mess

 Glad I Didn't Pay for This

 It is not overrated but it is not worthy of rating at all!

 An orgy of pseudo-sophisticated clichés

 Straight to DVD

 the quintessential Anderson contrivance, and as unsatisfying as the luridly-coloured, insubstantial confections his characters are so addicted to.

 Witty?!?!?!?! Witty?!?!?!?! Witty?!?!?!?! What the flip was witty in that film?!?!?!?!
