The show is based on Prisoner Cell Block H a gritty drama from the 70s and 80s. I recently watched all 692 episodes of Prisoner again and it was top notch, it could make you laugh, cry, angry, sad. Each episode is filled with drama. More happened in the first 10 episodes of the older Prisoner Cell Block H than has happened in all the seasons of Wentworth. The new Wentworth is so boring, yes it has a bit more sex and is a bit more graphic violence wise, but it has no good plots or stories, it doesn't deal with real issues faced by women in prison like Prisoner did and most of all it has absolutely no humour. Prisoner Cell Block H was so, so funny at times with the likes of Lizzy Birdsworth, Doreen Anderson, Bea Smith, Chrissy Latham, Mouse, Lurch etc.. It was a serious drama but you got some real belly laughs from it too. Wentworth on the other hand is totally devout of any humour, Boomer is the only one really giving any laughs and they are silly cheap laughs usually about her size or lack if education.I would recommend not watching Wentworth and going on YouTube (all 692 episodes are free to watch) and watching the original Prisoner it is a million times better.
