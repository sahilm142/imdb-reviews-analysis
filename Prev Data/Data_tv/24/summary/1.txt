 Season 3. worst ending I have ever seen!

 Season 3 was a waste of a great cast

 What the...?

 Unbearable

 A Horrible Idea for a TV Ripoff of an Incredible Film

 Very disappointed with season 1

 Terribly disappointing

 season 3 boring, slow, almost unwatchable

 Genius ruined by season 3!

 utter derivative, artless trash

 Stupid people killing stupid people....thats entertainment?

 Decent Actors Can't Save a Horrible Premise

 This movie is a joke compared to the film.

 Rule no 1 of fight club . . . . .

 Season 3: A complete hotch-potch of garbage ..CONTAINS SPOILERS!

 Horrid show

 Terrible show and poor acting

 This review is a favour to my fellow human beings
