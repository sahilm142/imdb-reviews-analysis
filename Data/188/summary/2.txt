 Half hour movie expanded to 163 minutes

 Overlong, unengaging and pretentious.

 I'd rather get stalked than sit through this again

 Not a sci-fi thats for sure

 Couldn't sit through the whole film

 waiting for the end of the film

 Rather disappointing

 Tedious and pretentious.

 Watching Paint Dry

 Some good dialogue and cinematography, but generally boring

 Infinity... Of... Something?

 Has some interesting footage of a run down Russian town but that's about it

 'The Zone'.
