 A Nutshell Review: (DVD) My Neighbor Totoro (1988)

 Magical film for young and old!

 Keeps and leaves you with a big SMILE!

 My favorite animated feature

 My Neighbor Totoro turned me into a little squish-ball, and I mean that as a compliment

 Extremely cute(in a good way!)

 Subtle and poetic

 Awesome!
