True it was a well made film with strong performances from Postelwaite and Lewis, however the one sided story favoring the Irish was nothing more than a film makers political agenda. I am sick and tired of films making Great Britain out to be the villians and the Irish holier than thou martyrs.Just once I would like to see England defended in one of these big budget films.No one country is innocent.The obvious Irish sympathies in this film make it unwatchable.Not once is England portrayed in this film as anything but a stock villian! Wake up people this film is nothing but Irish propaganda.


                
another piece of selective filmmaking. Anyone ask why all films about Northern Ireland are from a Republican perspective ? if not you owe it to yourself to find out the truth.This is based on the truth...in that there is a place called Northern Ireland..and then it gets a bit hazy. This is irresponsible, nonsense.
