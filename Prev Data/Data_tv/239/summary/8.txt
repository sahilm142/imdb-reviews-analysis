 What took so long Syfy?!?

 Don't Listen to Reviewers Who Only Watched Episode One

 Sense of realism brings this series to life.....

 A show out of this world - literally...

 The new frontier of sci-fi and Syfy series

 SyFy redeems itself and saves sci-fi in one swoop

 takes a while to get into

 It starts out a bit slow and meh, but gets much much better.

 An Interplanetary Drama

 Could this be the future

 Very good after few episodes

 Pleasantly Surprised

 Far better than "Discovery"

 Well done SyFy... Well done

 SYFY is back in business with The Expanse

 Good TV Sci Fi

 Slow moving, but good...

 An good quality sci-fi series for a change

 Great

 Holden Hotness

 Ambitious grounded sci-fi

 Quality Science Fiction That is Worth Giving a Try!

 Finally, a space series to rival Firefly

 A great mystery awaits

 Inconsistencies prevent it from being great
