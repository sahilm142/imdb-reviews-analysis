 Welcome to the most overrated film in history.

 Gone with the Long Winded

 Most overrated film ever besides Citizen Kane

 Gone with the Time.

 Not bad, perhaps, but soooo overrated...

 Gone With the Wind? If it were up to me it would be

 Not worthy of the acclaim it receives

 Really a struggle to watch

 Long, Bad, and With Few Redeeming Qualities

 "I'm afraid now - - I'm afraid of dying . . . "

 Nice movie, but the story.........

 Detestable Depiction of Romance and of "Genteel" Civilization

 Too boring
