 Not Among Eastwood's Best

 Well, I have seen much better from Clint

 Interesting drama about a retired worker who is living at an Asian neighborhood

 Gran Torino, Eastwood all over.

 Extremely flawed film, which still packs a punch...

 Peep This Reviews

 Clint Eastwood may be old but he can still deliver a good movie

 A Minor Clint Eastwood Film Powered By His Badass Performance

 the memorable Golden Years of Walt Kowalski

 Eastwood's many talents trump a slightly flawed script

 Good but I think the Oscar talk is a bit much

 Even knowing how it will end, how big

 Cute but overrated

 Eastwood is still the most hardcore actor in Hollywood

 Eastwood is alone by also his character and performance

 Clint Eastwood shines in Gran Torino

 Great, but with some issues

 Even knowing how it's going to end, how big

 Could have been better

 Gran Torino

 a complete blast for NZ$13.30

 Eastwood knows how to make a movie

 Clint at his best in a superior offering about aging

 A perfect example of how a brilliant movie can be ruined by bad acting

 Not Eastwood's Best, But Still Pretty Darn Good
