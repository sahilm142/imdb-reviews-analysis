This is something which define the true kind of romance and quite interesting. Comedy which can engage you to watch it more. The lead cast is amazing of this series. Indian romance redefined in this series.


                
Season 1: Funny, stupid, romantic, sentimental; funny again, romantic even more - the sequence of events in this drama-romedy describe a not so easy looking love story of a poles-apart couple - Tankesh ( or the "Romedy" Couple).Above sounds commonplace, though as every couple has a unique story, so does this one. We sail through the stereotypical idiosyncrasies of dating, preparing for getting serious, then about real love and about the loved one; and then - imagine it all twisted and made a little too desperate to happen.Thus, we laugh the hardest and appreciate even more those very moments of trouble and tender joys.In this extraordinary story-telling of TVF producers, especially by the telewriter Biswapati Sarkar and the show creator Arunabh Kumar, the contemporary social dynamics is maintained with minimal fantasy making it an even more relatably enjoyable web series and a highly recommended one if we go by the word of our generation.For prospective viewers, please don't read another review to begin watching this one. Surprisingly likable!! And a 8/10 (Season 2: Viewing and hopefully reviewing soon.)
