The show consists of good characters, except for Drama, and relies on a steady brand of related themes. The Mandy Moore scenario was drawn out and an obvious play on attracting a popular name. The screenwriters fall victim to the common error of addressing audience demands. Opinion polls rank certain characters over others and they attempt to exploit that fact into interesting plots. As far as what is out there, Entourage is fun to watch and the easiest to relate to.Each episode consists of an Eric/Vince argument followed by an Ari/Eric argument. Luckily for us, at the end of 26 minutes, all is resolved. The story lines are without limitation for this cast of characters. The show seems to drift further and further away from Vince. That may be okay if the audience really drafts towards a particularly character (maybe Ari?), but if the show intends on pursuing a long term deal, they need to center the plot around Vince.
