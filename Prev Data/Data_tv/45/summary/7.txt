 An Extraordinary Production, Despite An Inferior Continuation After The Second Half Of The Second Season

 Twin Peaks losing its plot

 Engrossing, eccentric, unique, often deadpan funny; also, snail-paced, self-indulgent and somewhat overrated

 If only it did exist

 Devolution and Redemption

 Iconic, but wandering between genres too much.

 Playful

 An objective review of Twin Peaks

 Terrific first season; downhill from there

 What a great town!

 Strange but addictive

 Good show!

 No for everyone...

 Varies in quality
