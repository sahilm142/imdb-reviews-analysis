Are you kidding me? An 8.9? Really? Okay, lemme just break this down from the experience that I had. It starts out with lots of dark colors and a generally gray atmosphere that gave me headaches from the blandness. But that's a stylistic choice I won't focus on. There was character dev in the first episode, and that was it. Light when from boring student to serial killer in like 15 minutes. And then it's just him Ocean's 11-ing schemes to kill people without the antagonists finding out. Well, until an 8 year old boy joins the crew. So Light talks to Ryuk a very small amount of time then he just became a background character. Light is a generally unlikable guy with a flat personality that he held true till the end. L was probably diabetic by the end. And the finale finished up just how I would expect from the person that created the series. A big "f**k you" to any fans by killing of the guy that most of the -angsty girls that touched themselves to his image- fans liked. The animation and drawing style are what's to be expected from a big budget anime, the dubs are acceptable, and any technical aspects were fine. In the end though, I personally watch something for an experience. I want to feel emotion about the media in some way, and I just didn't have that. I found a completely overrated and boring story about a kid that wants to kill people and is aided by a death god. What seemed possibly exciting became boring as it went from psycho-drama-adventure to cop drama. tl;dr boring
