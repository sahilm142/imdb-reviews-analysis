What is the message of this show? The main character is a total loser. He's not a loser in the way that he can't help it, he's just a loser because he refuses to accept reality. It's also ridiculous to see his parents not helping him out, something that tends to happen a lot in America that bothers me. There are some other things that I would like to say, but won't because it isn't politically correct, but the whole show makes certain people look really bad, and it's not the right image people across the world should be seeing.The show is alright to watch, but I don't know if I would watch another season, to be honest.


                
It is unfunny, unoriginal and celebrates the BLM and entitlement, victim mentality of most of Atlanta's populous ... skip this hard
