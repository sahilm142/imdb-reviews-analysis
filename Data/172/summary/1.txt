 So boring you'll question your sanity

 Scorsese Lays a Very Large Rotten Egg

 Completely idiotic

 Boring and pretentious

 A Horrible Movie

 The Good and The Bad

 insignificant

 don't get misled

 See it? Skip it? Flush it!

 Where do I apply for a refund

 Marty has gone bats

 Literally made me angry

 Like the lighthouse....

 A huge let down for a hyped up movie

 I will struggle to make 10 lines
