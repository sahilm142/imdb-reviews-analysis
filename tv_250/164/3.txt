But I don't. It's got big names and big talent but, in the end, collapses under the weight of bad scripts. Somewhere along the line, the writers decided that each exchange between characters had to explain film history, presumably to the youngsters who don't know or care about Hollywood legends. Newsflash: They aren't watching it. For the rest of us, it makes for boring, ponderous dialogue. Language is unnecessarily course and contributes nothing to the story. What a waste of some very talented actors.


                
I like both of the main actresses. I just can't see either of them as the perspective characters they are supposed to be portraying. Bette Davis had feuds with a lot of people. That really isn't anything new or entertaining. I am thinking this is going to be way too camp. Mr Murphy is known for his very cliché often times mechanical camp productions. It is terribly overacted. It is almost like watching a soap opera....geez. I watched just to see what they were going to do with it. I couldn't give it a one star. That seemed cruel however well deserved. This is just one episode. I might try again.
