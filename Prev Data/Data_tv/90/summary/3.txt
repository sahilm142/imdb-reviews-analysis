 Over-rated Soap with little depth and preposterous plot lines

 Superficially good, but worst in deeper

 For Masterpiece Classics, it's not up to par

 The series should die with Matthew

 Truly bad and lazy scripting - not even soap opera standards

 Review of Season Two

 Overrated and Boring

 Poor, with a few rich moments

 Slippery Slope

 Season 4, what a drag!

 put me to sleep
