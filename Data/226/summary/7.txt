 Very Good

 The Beginning of an Incredible Franchise

 Entertaining sci-fi action-drama

 One Of Arnold & Sci-Fi's Best!

 The Terminator

 "I'll Be Back"

 A good thinking man's action movie.

 Marinetti's Hero

 No classic, but entertaining

 Ah-nold kicking butt, cyborg-style!

 Not That GREAT of a Movie

 Good, but not great

 Reinvented the sci-fi genre.It would be a shame if this film was never seen.

 Inspired a generation

 Good

 It was great. Is still is. Arnie was always the best as the bad guy. There's a rumor, Don't know if its true. Arnie has a brief cameo in Terminator Salvation.

 Both "Terminator" movies will always be back.

 "I'll be back." Wait for him, the sequel is better.

 Terminator A Good Sci-Fi Film With Some Flaws

 A very fun movie, but simply overrated.

 A cultural touchstone and terrific plot that wears itself thin after some time has passed

 Arnold Schwarzenegger gone evil as a Terminator!

 Good start for a notorious sci-fi franchise and it's the film that was a big break for Arnold

 The Defining Sci-fi
