The stunning virtual world of Wall.E shows Pixar at the top of their creative graphic powers. Going over the beautiful CGI in my head, I'm still in awe of how the designers portrayed Wall.E's integrated world and their attention to detail will serve as a benchmark for years. That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale. I'm guessing the target audience for this movie is somewhere around 6th graders. Great summer family fare but not a great movie if you want something more substantial in terms of plot and character development.


                
This is the story of Wall-E a robot who is alone working on earth cleaning up the polluted planet. One day he finds a plant and takes it home. When one day a space ship lands Wall-E meets EVE who has been left on the planet for some reason. The reason is to find signs that plants are returning, so when Wall-E shows EVE the planet she sends a signal for pick up and is whisked back to a space ship where all of mankind has been living-with Wall-E in pursuit.This is a mostly wordless feature film not only about robots who fall in love but also what it means to be human and what it means to be alive. Its also a satire, of sorts, about the fat lazy people that we in the West have become.Technically this is one of the most beautifully animated films that Pixar has done. Its wonderful to look at. The places and spaces and the characters are all beautifully rendered. The film creates more than good number of real characters, both robots and people and its the characters that make the film worth seeing.The problem is that the story is a bit of a mess. On the one hand you have the central story of the romance of Wall-E and EVE, but you also have this glaring social commentary looming over everything. From the polluted Earth of the first half to the fat people in space during the second. Which is more important? To me its the romance and its there that the film shines. Frankly I got teary during any number of sequences dealing with the romance. Unfortunately the "get the plant so we can go home story" kind of goes nowhere smoothly as situation keeps being inserted again and again to keep it going. On top of that we have the not so hidden messages about how lazy we all are and how happiness is "not following the path". The story goes from well told story about Wall-e and Eve to the Captain (who is wonderful and under utilized-I wanted more of him) to the two human "lovers" John and Mary who begin to see life out side of their hoover-chairs.There is this really good robot romance stuck in here thats gotten lost somewhere along the way. I was sobbing during the four minute trailer that was floating around a few months ago that focused beautifully on the romance. I went from not being sure if it would work to being sure they hit it out of the park. There's this wonderful simple story locked in there with all this not as wonderful stuff around it. (A word of warning- the trailers give a good number of gags away) Yes I've complain about every Pixar Movie. (Toy Story 2 isn't as good as the first one, Bugs Life is too slow, Monsters Inc was not quite Toys Story, Nemo didn't completely thrill me, Incredibles is too long, Cars is too simple and their eyes wig me out, Ratatouille, while very good, isn't the the great second coming many claimed) Say What you will I own all but A Bugs Life. Other than Cars I think all have improved with time (thanks to the critical claim that this Pixar is the next big thing no loner being considered) And while I do think Ratatouille has too much story and needs to be trimmed down, I don't think that any of them have as many problems story wise as this (certainly none has as many character needing exploration and fleshing out).What is this film about-really I don't know. I adore the romance and wish I had someone to take to see it since its so charming, but at the same time...I don't know it all doesn't come together for me.Perhaps I could see some of the story line too clearly. I could tell what the next shot was or the next motion would be. Perhaps I saw too many jokes in the trailers and commercials. Maybe it was the god awful Hello Dolly clip playing over and over and over. Maybe it was the one movie too many that played Le Vie En Rose. I don't know. there is something about the film that doesn't allow it to hang together for me. I admire its construction but I don't love the result.I still like it. I'd give it between 6.5 to 7 out of 10, but at the same time the parts are better then the whole.Go see it and make up your own mind-if nothing else there are some really neat things in it.
So yeah, this is a pretty good movie. It's something that the everyone in the family can enjoy; and is well worth the 9 bucks I paid to see it.However......this movie probably shouldn't be in the top 250, let alone top 25. It's not even Pixar's best. Both of the two Toy Stories, AND Finding Nemo are better movies! They may not surpass WALL-E in animation, but they are better, and more original stories. Even the animation doesn't leave me in awe as it does so many others on IMDb apparently. It is repetitive, and lacks style in a way. An example would be "scared" WALL-E (even if you haven't seen the movie, you've seen it in previews). He just shakes! That would be OK, except he does it 3 or 4 times in the movie! Do something different! To add to that, both the story and music is basically stolen. 2001: a space odyssey, star trek, star wars; all stolen from.


                
I just came back from seeing WALL-E with my 9-year-old son. I walked out of that theatre feeling as though I'd been hit over the head with an anvil. The message is about as subtle as a kick in the crotch, but it needs to be said and I'm just a little tired of some of the diatribes I've read that are masquerading as "reviews". People--it's a movie, and meant to be entertaining. If you personally are not entertained, that does not make it a bad movie, just not one that is right for you. And if the message strikes a little close to home and makes you uncomfortable, then maybe it's time to get off your backside and do something constructive about it, hmmmm? I go to the theater about three times a year at most--I end up renting most films from the shop because I don't like being pummeled with the noise that seems necessary on the big screen because people will not stop yakking away at the theatre. I really enjoyed the experience of watching WALL-E, and found myself laughing out loud repeatedly--and I enjoyed it far more than I did either the over-hyped DARK KNIGHT or INDIANA JONES AND THE LATEST PILE OF MONEY, both of which gave me sick headaches by the time I left the theatre.My summary says it all. I just about peed my pants while watching PRESTO, the short. As always, PIXAR is at its best when it's working with cartoon shorts. I haven't laughed so hard since the first time I saw FOR THE BIRDS, the short attached to MONSTERS INC.. It's a great homage to the style of Warner Brothers (you'll understand when you see it; the feel of it is pure Bugs Bunny) and if the only way I'll be able to own it one day is to buy the disc for WALL-E, I consider that a bargain.Oh, and for the record, my son, diagnosed ADHD (and currently not medicated), adored the movie, even the long stretch at the beginning when people's biggest complaint seems to be that "nothing happens". He was riveted to the screen the whole time. I'm not jumping on the bandwagon and claiming that this movie is some kind of cinematic masterpiece, but I felt that it was definitely worth the price of admission--and that's saying a great deal these days. Go to enjoy the quality of the animation, to be reminded of HELLO, DOLLY! (I'd forgotten about that movie--I really must rent it soon!), and, yes, to take away a message that perhaps it's time to be just a little more aware of what we're doing to our environment and where this might lead us. Rather than make excuses and attacking the message behind the movie, it might behoove us more to stop and ponder, if only for a moment, where we will be going.


                
I don't know if I would have liked this movie better if my expectations weren't so high.I agree with those critics who say the first half hour, which contained so little dialogue, was excellent. However, in the remainder of the movie, the animation got in the way of the story. The animation was stunning, but it was also distracting. In Ratatouille and Toy Story 2, the story drove the movie, and although the animation was great, it wasn't so overwhelming that it interfered.I recently took my granddaughter to see Kung Fu Panda, which was not as well animated but overall was much more enjoyable. The greatness of the animation can detract from the greatness of the movie.


                
Disney/Pixar animation at its most beautiful, but also at its most annoying. In Earth's distant future, trash and refuse has replaced all life on the planet; a waste-reclamation robot (with human emotions and feelings) has a daily routine of condensing and piling up the junk-cubes into skyscrapers made of garbage. WALL·E is an amusing, resourceful, lovable hunk of metal and rubber who is also something of a happy hoarder (his collection includes Christmas lights, utensils, a cigarette lighter, a video-cassette of "Hello, Dolly!" and, most importantly, a small plant still encased in dirt). Director Andrew Stanton also co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Reardon (based on Stanton and Pete Docter's idea), and they have fashioned a mind-blowing, heart-tugging first act. WALL·E, whose only friend is a winsome little cockroach (!), is visited one day by EVE, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who inadvertently leads (and lifts) WALL·E off the Earth and into the galaxy (the film's peak moment) where he discovers obese, computer and soda-addicted humans living on a space station. This is arguably the moment where the movie begins losing some of its heart; Stanton shoots-up on the imaginative possibilities of the circumstance, revving the pace and sending the editing into overdrive (possibly to compensate?). There's a revolt of man-serving machines, a Captains' mutiny with the main power source, comedic elements derived from various popular films, and WALL·E's desire to be reunited with EVE (which is all we really care about). The film goes out of its way to engage younger viewers by immersing itself in cute behavior, cute responses and one-liners, and manic action-action-action. Cuteness is a prerequisite for Disney/Pixar, of course, but Stanton really lays it on thick delivering several false endings, all manipulated for that ultimate sentimental sock. Pixar Goes Green! And that's fine, if not especially amusing. The wondrous, wonderful first half-hour was still far more engaging. *** from ****


                
It's the future, folks, and once again, life on Earth is a shoddy bit of business. Environmental abuses have destroyed the planet, human beings have spent the last 700 years getting morbidly obese while cruising naively through space in an interstellar ocean liner, and the only sentient entities left on the mother planet are cockroaches (the only apparent life-forms) and Wall-E, a tiny robot whose job it is to clean up trash. He's been doing this for centuries, long past the point where his original mission was abandoned, but without any orders to countermand his initial instructions, he must continue on his course, and does so, dutifully and without complaint.That is, until the unexpected arrival of Eve, a significantly more advanced robot, who flies in from space and tours the surface of the Earth, apparently looking for life. Glad for the company, Wall-E befriends the newcomer and shares his recent and miraculous discovery: a plant of some kind, growing inside a boot. Subsequent adventures return Eve to the Axiom, the aforementioned ocean liner, with Wall-E in tow. Therein, the two must resolve a dispute between the Captain of the ship, who sees the plant and wants to re-colonize Earth, and Co-Pilot, an automated navigation system that refuses to deviate from ancient instructions labeling Earth life-threatening.It's a good movie all in all, but it's not good enough, at least not for my taste.I take my sci-fi seriously. It's a fault of mine, and I willingly admit it. I don't like cute robots, I don't like explosions that are audible in space, and I'm highly annoyed with the overwhelming mass of thinly supported "space fantasy" that's given the genre a light-hearted, superficial, and escapist tone, marginalizing such intellectual literary greats as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke and preventing science fiction from ever receiving the respect and recognition it deserves.Wall-E is certainly better than the average offender. Astonishing visuals, a solid sense of humor, and the good old Pixar charm combine to make it one of the more enjoyable films of the summer. I was especially amused with the Apple references: Wall-E's Macintosh startup sound, the ubiquitous iPod design, the use of MacInTalk for Co-Pilot's voice, et cetera. Like Ratatouille, The Incredibles, and the rest of the Pixar canon, there's a lot of depth to the movie, more than enough to lift it above the shoulders of standard kiddy fair.Unfortunately, no amount of glamour could distract me from the plethora of unanswered questions that by the end of the movie had piled up higher than Wall-E's towers of junk. Why, for instance, would Wall-E's designers make him capable of empathy, when the tediousness of his job description made any kind of emotion a severe liability? As an emotional creature, how could he spend 700 years performing history's most repetitive task without going insane? Why would a perfunctory probe like Eve come equipped with facial expressions and the capacity for romance? What were the cockroaches feeding on if Earth had been lifeless for seven centuries? What can you make of a robot strong enough to hang onto the outside of a spaceship blasting into orbit but weak enough to get taken out by a handful of shopping carts? Why would the passengers of the Axiom slide down the slope of the deck when the ship clearly created its own gravity and, as such, could assume any number of positions in space without anyone on the inside of the ship ever knowing the difference? And how could a society of obese layabouts with seventy decades of sloth at their backs so quickly warm to the challenge of "re-colonizing Earth?" Sure, it's a G-rated cartoon, and children are the primary audience, and part of me feels like a nit-picking A-hole to even think about getting this technical, but I can't shake the feeling that Stanton could have invested a little more in the way of plausibility without making his movie any less appealing. The kids would still have been happy, the fantasy lovers wouldn't have known the difference, and the small batch of sci-fi curmudgeons like myself could have basked in the certainty that finally a director cared enough about our interests to pitch us a story we believed.
It's not unusual for Pixar to make a movie that is unforgettable. This film proves that humans aren't the only things with feelings, and it shows it in an awesome way. The movie has barely a word spoken in the first 30 minutes, but tells a story so touching and so innocent it leaves you breathless. The first half is transcendent. Although WALL-E is a robot composed of assorted metals, he is anything but lifeless. I was really surprised at the quality and depth of the movie. This is not your ordinary children's cartoon by any stretch of the imagination. I can not say that I highly recommend it, but it is worth watching once.


                
A lot of hullabaloo for nothing. Perfectly boring. What's more on a sensitive subject that is dealt with in such extreme terms that it becomes terroristic. Terroristically antipollution. Terroristically anti-obesity. Terroristically anti-machine and anti-corporation. And on the other side there are two robots who fall in love <U+0096> ah ah ah I laugh, it is so romantic, the love of a piece of junk with another piece of junk <U+0096> a cockroach who is definitely not heavy enough to re-balance the situation. A pathetic lack of imagination with even the Zarathustra of Strauss and the allusion to 2001, the Space Odyssey, an allusion that no kid can understand. Walt Disney is winking at the curators of the museum of cinematographic antiquities. In other words it can work in the US because they have no competition from the rest of the world YET. But they should really think twice next time now Spielberg is moving to Dubai and the Chinese are getting ready to take off.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
A refreshing surprise - a film that takes its own path and does not rely too heavily on cliché, references and violence. The start with little dialogue is brave, the animation good, and the story gathers you in. Some cute gags about the last robot left on Earth just carrying on doing his job, until alien probes begin to look around! A touch too sentimental in parts like old time Disney, but the plot whisks along. An excellent touch is that the humans, who finally get a look in some time in, all look alike and are obese, while the robots are generally very distinguishable. The plot is the same as 'Logan's Run' and the thriller denouement is '2001' but it still does not disappoint as familiarity creeps in over the last 15 minutes. good, no very good.
I am torn about how I felt about this movie. On the one hand, I really liked how the filmmakers were able to get you to sympathize with an animated robot and really root for him. This was very well done, and much of the animation was stunning. In many ways, this was a very impressive effort.However, I also found the film to be excruciatingly slow at certain points. It seemed as if the filmmaker felt that the audience was too stupid to make inferences about the characters unless he drew scenes out for a very long time and beat them over the head with it. I found myself becoming increasingly bored as the movie wore on. If it had been edited down 30 minutes, it would have been a much better movie.


                
WALL-E is a very popular Oscar-winning film, so my giving it a 6 must seem like sacrilege. However, I don't do this just to buck convention or be a jerk---I just thought it didn't have a particularly good plot. As for the animation, not surprisingly, it's absolutely beautiful--probably the prettiest CGI film to date.The story begins on a desolate Earth. Everywhere is garbage and the crumbling bits of a long-dead city are the home of WALL-E the robot. Apparently, his job is to help clean up the mess and it's obvious he has been doing it for centuries. You see no other robots, so you assume that they have long since ceased functioning. This portion of the movie lasts quite a while--with no dialog and not much story.A bit later, a probe lands on the Earth and WALL-E is thrilled because he apparently is lonely. The other robot seemed rather reticent to engage with WALL-E, but WALL-E follows 'Eve' like a stalker. Eventually, Eve finds a lone plant and pulls it inside its shell. Then she seems to shut down. However, a ship soon arrives and brings her back to a huge space cruiser filled with weeble-like humans. It seems that Eve's purpose was to seek out evidence of life on Earth so that the humans can return after a 700 year absence. It seems that they made the planet pretty uninhabitable in the 2100s and now, perhaps, it's time to go home. However, there is an unexpected glitch that may prevent the ship from returning.My problems with the story have to do with anthropomorphizing the robots. They are NOT human and they cannot possess feelings--yet in this Disney world they do. Well, this is hard to believe, but even if this is so, the robots only have a bit of a personality. They are not so lovable and they have very limited vocabularies. Because of that, the first 39 minutes are pretty dull, as there isn't much to do other than watch WALL-E (for the first 15 or so minutes) or Eve and WALL-E for the next 24 minutes. Once the humans are involved, it gets a bit better--but only just a bit. Most of this final segment of the film seems to be chase scenes and the humans are given practically no personality as well. I don't see how kids sat still during the movie and I assume this is a film that critics loved but I can't imagine younger kids loving with the same fervor as TOY STORY or MONSTERS, INC..Overall, a lovely film to look at so I give it a 7 just for the amazing artistry, but a rather unexpectedly dull story keeps it from a higher score. I know that puts me in a small minority, but this seems like Pixar's most overrated film. Heck, the short film that preceded WALL-E (PRESTO) was much better than the film that followed.
OK, first, this movie has some amazing animation. It looks real some of the time. Wall-e is definitely one of the cutest characters which appears to be based off of short circuit's johnny 5. All around it's a good movie... but a 9 on a 10 scale seems a little high to me. As i said when I came out, A cute movie that I'll probably not want to see again. Kids will like it, adults will think wow, thats how animation is these days. It goes a little long. When i come out of a great movie, which is what I consider an 8 or higher, It zips by. You know when the movie is almost over and you say to yourself, " Wow! It's over already" Yeah, that did not happen to me in this film although I liked it.


                
So as I am skimming through the comments, I notice that there is not a single person who voted for the movie and gave it less than an eight on the first four pages. Does Disney really have people that hooked? I cannot see how this movie was appealing to anyone. I saw the movie the day before it came out and was very excited because I have always been a fan of Pixar movies and I went into this one with optimism...but I was terribly disappointed.The first thirty minutes of the movie contain three words..."WALL-E", "EVE", and "Directive". First of all, a little kid is not going to know the meaning of directive. And after about twenty minutes of nothing but the noise of WALL-E moving, the kids are going to fall asleep... Four of the eight adults in my theater fell asleep before they even left Earth.I appreciate what the people at Pixar were trying to do (which is why I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1) with the lack of dialogue and everything, but the voices of the robots were excruciating to listen to for over 90 minutes. This is definitely not a movie to keep the kids entertained. It seems as though Pixar was simply trying to test the limits and see how far they could go and still receive immaculate reviews. This movie is the reason Pixar is the leader in children's movies, because no matter how bad of a movie they make, people find a way to forgive them and convince themselves the movie was good.Some of the social commentary in the movie was decent, but it was nothing new and exciting. The world is getting lazy and everyone knows it; the social commentary was nothing groundbreaking so I don't believe that that can be a reason for liking the movie either. In my opinion this movie does not deserve to make the millions of dollars it is going to. Put Pixar on a poster and people with worship the movie regardless... If you don't agree with me, fine, but I thought there needed to be some voice for the people who do not kiss the ground Pixar walks on.
Good show, some laughs, good graphics, but the side story? Give me a break, when I really want a humanities message in a kids show I will give Steven Segal a call. Yeah, we have trashed the planet and killed off a bunch of the animal life. And we have gotten lazy but not up to what WALL-E portrays. Kung Fu Panda beat this movie out in almost every category. KFP has better humor, storyline, acting (better actors gave more feeling in citing their lines). Better graphics by Pixar but that doesn't make rating the film a ten. There are some awe inspiring space scenes for about five minutes of the film. So if you want to see a kids show that rates a 10 go see KFP as it is funnier, no preaching, and had my kids coming out of the show trying to be Kung Fu masters. My kids left WALL-E wanting to go get something to eat.


                
I love Disney/Pixar movies. In fact, there isn't a single one I don't like. But this one isn't the "hit" I thought it would be.Wall-E is another prime example of why Pixar rules the digital cartoon world; fantastic character animation and landscape vistas. The rings of Saturn scene, in particular, was great! So the problem here is obviously the writing.For the first time at a D/P film, my children were bored at some points in the movie, and so was I. There's nothing wrong with the story in and of itself that I can see. And I honestly can't put my finger on it directly. But something is missing from this movie that many of the others have; a certain charm if you will. I will say it kind of nags at me that he looks so much like Johnny-5 from Short Circuit. I'm not sure why they didn't use a different design.This is a good movie none-the-less, and tons of people will love it. But for me personally, it's not in the ranking with Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, or The Incredibles, but more in the A Bugs Life, Toy Story 2, and Cars list. If that makes any sense to anyone :)


                
It is 700 years in the future. A city of skyscrapers rises up from the land. A closer view reveals that the skyscrapers are all constructed out of garbage, neatly compacted into squares or bales and piled on top of one another. In all the land, only one creature stirs. This is WALL-E, the last of the functioning solar-powered robots. He - the story leaves no doubt about gender - scoops up trash, shovels it into his belly, compresses it into a square and climbs on his tractor treads and heads up a winding road to the top of his latest skyscraper, to place it neatly on the pile.It is lonely being WALL-E. But does WALL-E even know that? He comes home at night to a big storage area, where he has gathered a few treasures from his scavengings of the garbage and festooned them with Christmas lights. He wheels into his rest position, takes off his treads from his tired wheels and goes into sleep mode. Tomorrow is another day: One of thousands since the last humans left the Earth and settled into orbit aboard gigantic spaceships that resemble spas for the fat and lazy.One day WALL-E's age-old routine is shattered. Something new appears in his world, which otherwise has consisted only of old things left behind. This is, to our eye, a sleek spaceship. To WALL-E's eyes, who knows? What with one thing and another, WALL-E is scooped up by the ship and returned to the orbiting spaceship Axiom, along with his most recent precious discovery: a tiny, perfect green plant, which he found growing in the rubble and transplanted to an old shoe.Have you heard enough to be intrigued, or do you want more? Speaking voices are now heard for the first time in the movie, although all on his own, WALL-E has a vocabulary (or repertory?) of squeaks, rattles and electronic purrs, and a couple of pivoting eyes that make him look downright anthropomorphic. We meet a Hoverchair family, so known because aboard ship they get around in comfy chairs that hover over surfaces and whisk them about effortlessly. They're all as fat as Susie's aunt.This is not entirely their fault, since generations in the low-gravity world aboard the Axiom have evolved humanity into a race whose members resemble those folks you see whizzing around Wal-Mart in their electric shopping carts.There is now a plot involving WALL-E, the ship's captain, several Hover people and the fate of the green living thing. And in a development that would have made Sir Arthur Clarke's heart beat with joy, humanity returns home once again - or is that a spoiler?The movie has a wonderful look. Like so many of the Pixar animated features, it finds a color palette that's bright and cheerful, but not too pushy, and a tiny bit realistic at the same time. The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, as perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books: Everything has a stylistic twist to give it flair. And a lot of thought must have gone into the design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection. Consider this hunk of tin beside the Kung Fu Panda. The panda was all but special-ordered to be lovable, but on reflection, I think he was so fat, it wasn't funny anymore. WALL-E, however, looks rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes. The movie draws on a tradition going back to the earliest days of Walt Disney, who reduced human expressions to their broadest components and found ways to translate them to animals, birds, bees, flowers, trains and everything else.What's more, I don't think I've quite captured the film's enchanting storytelling. Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed "Finding Nemo," it involves ideas, not simply mindless scenarios involving characters karate-kicking each other into high-angle shots. It involves a little work on the part of the audience, and a little thought, and might be especially stimulating to younger viewers. This story told in a different style and with a realistic look could have been a great science-fiction film. For that matter, maybe it is.Note: The movie is preceded by "Presto," a new Pixar short about a disagreement over a carrot between a magician and his rabbit.
The movie could get boring in the first half part. I wish they had taken more care of the comedian side of the movie, and it lacks important and fate-deciding events.
The thing that I liked the most about it was the idea, it was new. And the movie was well directed and well executed.
For me it was a romance, that all family members of all ages would enjoy especially the ladies.


                
I do not normally have an interest in writing reviews, but when I viewed a couple of them for this movie, there were so misleading as to demand a balance. Overall this is a nicely decent children's movie, but it is not a work of art nor is it at all thought provoking. It has a message and that message is slammed into your face multiple times. It is a good message, I would want my kids to get it and to live by it, but even a very young child doesn't need that many repeats. The plot is predicable. The anthropomorphic robots are somewhat charming. The jokes are cute, not really funny. The graphics are great. The movie steals from so many Sci-Fi movies as to look almost original, but anyone who has seen those movies recognizes them easily. Note: a good thing to do for adults getting bored is to see how many of those steals you can recognize. What I don't get is how many people suggested this is some fantastic effort. It isn't, but it is a pleasant little time waster.


                
First of all when I saw the trailer for Wall-E I was excited to see another Pixar film. After watching the movie I couldn't help but to wish that the story was more isolated on the two main characters instead.At the beginning of the movie it was a little surprise to me with the subliminal message that they were saying but I was willing to see past that because of the little robot. He had the best characteristics from the beginning to the end of the movie and the fact that he was pretty much alone made it more interesting for me to continue on.By the time I got to the second half of the movie I found that my attention was taken from Wall-E back to the subliminal messages again which seem to linger on. It became a battle for me between caring about the little robot versus caring about the outcome of the human race especially towards the end.Overall I still think its worth seeing just for the production quality alone but be aware it will be a little preachy.


                
So - I really do have to say that I'm a big - dare i say huge - fan of what Pixar puts out - and I was incredibly excited about WALL-E.I liked it - truly - but I didn't love it - and it annoyed me that its flaws were so apparent and so fixable.To begin - what has always kept Pixar films so fresh are a few factors: 1) Facing adult issues in very direct ways that allow young people to fully understand its impact (i.e. the death of a parent) in a way that is both mildly realistic and emotionally honest. 2) There has been a concerted effort to create subject matter and humor that is equally accessible to both adults and children.Many of the minor failures of WALL-E can be chalked up to the fact that a good deal of the subject matter and humor is dealt with in a way that swings wildly between material that only adults will "get" and enjoy, and pandering, bordering on saccharine "kiddie" humor - which, honestly, disappointed me a little. For how much attention to visual detail they've given this piece, I was more than a little disappointed that the subject matter (beyond the story line between WALL-E and EVE) was dealt with in an almost naive and cartoonish (in the bad sense of the word) way that belied not only the very important message that the movie was trying to say, but also belittled the intelligence of the children seeing the movie.All of that having been said - it is still a pretty good movie. I just didn't think it was up to the Pixar standard of such extraordinarily well made (and written) films like "Toy Story, "Finding Nemo," "The Incredibles," and "Ratatouille ."
Wall-E - My Review Current mood: warm Category: Movies, TV, Celebrities Let me start my saying I'm not a big fan of animated movies . That's basically because my kids seem to have them on a constant loop in my house. The reason i have decided to give this the ValleyJohn treatment was the news that Wall-E maybe nominated for best movie , not best animated movie at next years Academy Awards. I wanted to know why? The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.Although , as i previously said i'm not big lover of animation i can appreciate a good film when i see one. If i had to pick my favourites of recent years i would say Toy Story 1 & 2 and Madagascar top the list.Wall-E is undoubtedly up there with some of the best Disney Pixar movies but i couldn't help being disappointed with what i saw.I really enjoyed the first half an hour when Wall-E was doing what he does best and there were some really clever moments but as soon as he clung on to Eva's ship and found the humans holiday paradise in the sky i felt it lost it's way.I also found it slightly depressing. I know it's a love story and a story about hope but what a grim look on the future the makers of the film have. Give me Buzz Light year or Woody anytime over the talking trash can and the fat humans. Wall-E cost 180 million dollars to make and while it certainly looks spectacular I'm baffled as to how it cost that much to make. Not that Disney Pixar care , it made a staggering 500 million dollars world wide.I think it would be be a big mistake if the Acadamy enter this film as best film and not best animated film. It's far more likely to win the latter.Finally the best judge of films like Wall-E are kids themselves and while my two sons enjoyed it , it hasn't been back in the DVD player since they watched it last week while in the meantime Alex and Marty in Madagascar have entertained them for 150th and 151st time. That says it all.7 out of 10


                
In the 22nd century the earth is so full of garbage it becomes uninhabitable, so humans go to live on massive ships in space.Alone robot who was forgotten to be switched off lives a lonely life cleaning up, until one day something happens. The animation on this film is extremely good, and at times does not look like animation at all.Not really a children's film as it has a obvious message although it is rammed down your throat.Film is at times touching and delightful and has lovable characters in WALL*Ehimself and EVA.Film has some funny moments but not as many as you might think.A touch overlong but good overall.


                
***Minor spoilers, but nothing crucial***First of all, I'm not a conservative. Far from it. That said, I decided to see this film based on my reaction to the trailer, which piqued my curiosity. It's about a lonely robot in the wasteland that departs for something otherworldly, and that's it.I truly loved the beginning of the film -- at least the first 20 minutes, mostly dialogueless in minimalist style, focused on Wall-E and his discovery of something alien. This was quite audacious for Pixar for reverting to minimalist style considering children might have short attention span because they need cartoon characters that talk and joke in rapid-fire conversations (which I hate in animated films).I almost cried near the ending which was quite an achievement for animated films after Pinocchio, Bambi, Beauty and the Beast and Spirited Away, and I rarely cry at the movies. Personally, I like the first 20 minutes and last five minutes the best. In between the film it's a naked sociopolitical film which is very ill-suited for children and may offend the adults' intelligence, contrary to positive reviews' claim it's a terrific film that will appeal to all ages.A political message disguised as satire was already done and *better* (for lack of expression) in Mike Judge's film Idiocracy. Wall-E may be genuinely offensive to some viewers -- it sums up the message as thusly: that fat and lazy humans are responsible for neglecting and destroying Planet Earth because of mass consumption promoted by irresponsible corporate culture.I find this message profoundly hypocritical, given the fact there is merchandising for Wall-E (go to Toys R' Us or check Amazon or ToyWiz for proof). The recent worst offender in overdone merchandising for movie promotion is Cars, which I never saw and do not intend to because I heard it's the worst Pixar film to date for contrived story.Andrew Stanton and co should leave idiotic politics at home because it won't work well with me, as I'm sure millions will concur with me that Pixar should not be a vehicle to push propaganda while being profoundly hypocritical with the merchandising toys that will end up in the landfills once children and collectors find products of no value. The fact that Andrew Stanton chose to use Wall-E as a vehicle for a soapbox message is nauseating that might actually dilute the emotional and aesthetic impact of the film.WALL-E begs for a fan edit by eliminating and minimalizing the human parts and unnecessary scenes to focus on Wall-E and its love interest to maximize emotional resonance without any pandering political idiocy (environmental or otherwise, because the point is already made by "Idiocracy" despite its R rating limiting the audience). Call it "The Slim & Lean Version" that runs at only about 45 minutes. A talented editor eliminated and silenced Jar-Jar Binks character in the legendary alternative version of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" and "improved" Episode II by removing 38 minutes of bad materials (The Phantom Edit).I support environmental issues as long as it is sound, but Wall-E was definitely harmed by the non-subliminal politiking in the middle (which makes it tedious in pacing and tone change) that have no reason to be in the gosh-darned G-rated film.Excellent CGI art all around, the best yet in a Pixar film so far, and the most poignant story involving only scenes with Wall-E. It would be a lot better as a short, yet the obnoxious message was forced into the film by petty "liberal-bent" politics at Pixar to pad the length. This may translate to less earnings at the box office once the mixed word of mouth propagates with dissatisfied adults taking children to the movies, expecting (to put it simply) "mindless" entertainment only to be insulted by the pandering attitude of pompous and moralistically shrill Pixar storytellers.*** out of 4


                
I don't make any excuses for it, but I am pretty resilient toward the wave of computer-animated films that has come to dominate our post-millennial cinematic experience<U+0096>call me old-fashioned, but I grew up with reruns of Looney Tunes, Saturday-morning cartoons, and theatrical releases done solely via cell animation. Appreciation of animation is a cross-generational phenomenon that has become more diverse with the ushering-in of computer technology<U+0096>plots contain enough colorful, slapstick humor to entertain the kids, but also a fair share of mature, witty writing to amuse their guardians. Yet still, I have never really gone out of my way to view these CG-rendered productions, and have always relied on the persuasion of others to give this emerging technique a chance.With "Wall-E," I may be sold on computer animation for the first time ever<U+0096>this is the kind of movie that justifies the extra wait in line on a major holiday.Being Pixar, "Wall-E" is preceded by a short (entitled "Presto!") that is aimed squarely at the 10-and-unders sitting in the audience: the tale of a magician's rabbit going to extreme lengths to get his owner to cough up a carrot. It is five minutes of madcap, frenetic amusement that is funnier in concept than its ultimately overachieving execution. If anything, it only helped raise my guard for the feature presentation."Wall-E" begins on a note of stunning minimalism<U+0096>the image of an abandoned Planet Earth, home only to the robot of the title (think "Short Circuit" meets "E.T.") and his best friend, a chirping (and adorable) cockroach. Wall-E's function? To compact all the leftover trash (and there's a lot of it) into cubes. The opening scenes convey a sense of isolation and awe (literal skyscrapers of junk), and immediately garner sympathy for our likable (if frequently Woody Allen-ish) protagonist, who has a storage unit filled with his own fascinating finds (including a VHS tape of "Hello Dolly!"). Living a life of routine, Wall-E (whose 'voice' is limited to a few robotic-sounding words) becomes smitten with a mysterious robot named Eve, whose objective may be the key to reviving a planet that, as we're told, has been unoccupied by humanity for 700 years.While ostensibly an animated feature aimed at kids, the surprising thing about "Wall-E" is how its wide-ranging mash-up of cinematic genres and films synthesizes into such a fresh, original whole: while Wall-E and Eve may owe a debt to German Expressionism (Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" in particular), their homage to a cinematic era when no spoken dialog was required to move audiences to tears, is remarkably effective and well-rendered (the early courtship scenes even recall classics like "City Lights"). And additionally, some later moments on a massive spaceship recalls the lunatics-running-the-asylum spirit of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (only with robots). Granted, writer-director Andrew Stanton inserts an incisive (if anvil-heavy) satire on our Wal*Mart-fixated culture of consumption, and keenly wonders if we've lost touch with the very acts that make us human; it only adds to the irony that, amid his attempts to save the world, Wall-E is really just a persistent romantic, looking to snare the woman he loves by any means necessary<U+0096>the endless pursuit of the blue-collar, working-class male to win over a beautiful woman whose career won't let her slow down for romance.It makes for one of the most moving motion pictures I've seen in a while.
