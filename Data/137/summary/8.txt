 Magnificent film based on actual events with top-notch performances by all star cast

 Do the right thing.

 Final Judgement on The Reich

 How criminalistic we humans can get to be!

 Hollywood's best in an important film

 Probably one of the most important films of the 1960s...still highly relevant...

 A Very Interesting & Well-Crafted Look at a Difficult Subject

 It's Still All About Complacency!

 Surprisingly Powerful

 "One can't live with hate. I know that"

 A definitive, if ponderous, courtroom drama

 Gripping, if self-important

 A movie that depicts justice being administered to those who dispensed justice in the name of the 3rd Reich during WWII

 Fantastic movie except for the last 5 minutes

 Powerful movie

 Anatomy of a Holocaust<U+0085>

 the film is a vociferous diatribe towards all the warmongers among the human race

 An acting seminar...

 A little bit of history...

 Post-WWII Courtroom Drama.
