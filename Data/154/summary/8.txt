 The Bromance Fight

 Warrior is on a Warpath! What an awesome movie! It was a knockout!

 While Predictable And Not Wholly Original, This Poignant Film About Two Brothers Is A Total Knockout

 8/10

 Fantastic movie!

 An underrated fight movie with great acting

 Makes you feel conflicted about who should win

 Great

 People tearing each other apart, both figuratively and literally

 A perfect plot twist

 How this failed to get a Best Picture nomination is something of a mystery

 Hits You So Hard That It May Even Knock You Out

 Wow!

 best fighting movie i've ever seen

 One of the Greatest Sports Movies Ever Made.

 One of the Best Movies of 2011

 Two brothers making a name for themselves

 Unoriginal, clichéd and predictable; brilliant, powerful and moving

 emotional, entertaining and great fighting!

 Great movie! However...

 Fantastic MMA movie.

 A tale of two brothers

 The real fight is outside of the cage.

 Worthy Warrior

 Better than I ever would've expected
