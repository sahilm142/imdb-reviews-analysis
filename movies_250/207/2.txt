Andrei Rublev is the most boring movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Tarkovsky's use of abstract storytelling may work for some people, but it did not work for me. It didn't work for me here, and it didn't work for me in the last movie I watched of his called Stalker. Abstract storytelling can work in a specific context. Eraserhead comes to mind. But while that movie had the decency of now being very long and having plenty of striking visual imagery to keep me entertained, Andrey Rublev is essentially a slowly paced three hour drama, with no interesting story or characters at all.To really show what I mean by this I want to talk a bit about the last hour. The last hour is basically just a boy, whom we had never seen to this point and know nothing about, building a bell for a local prince. What?!?!The movie never spends time with its characters, not even the title one, so that we can get to know or care about them. The story is not told in any kind of a traditional sense, which as I stated earlier can work fine depending on the type of film, but when doing a biopic you wan't to stay a bit more on track.
