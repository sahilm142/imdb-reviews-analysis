 Superficial

 A corny teen melodrama passed off as a masterpiece...

 Dead creativity society

 DON'T FALL FOR THIS MOVIE!

 A ghastly attempt to understand teenagers

 Great stuff

 An overrated movie

 Flowers of sulphur

 --Very boring--

 not a "must-see"

 Beautifully made, tragically ruined

 There are powerful moments towards the end, but other than that I found it surprisingly empty and boring

 not up to the hype
