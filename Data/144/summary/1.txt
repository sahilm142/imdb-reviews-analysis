 Notify Mr Scorcese: Its show, not tell.

 Please stop the music

 Clichéd, contrived, implausible, tired

 Pointless, waste of talent

 The reward for those who overrated *GoodFellas*.

 I liked Goodfellas but this really wasn't that great.

 It sucks

 movie casino

 One of the great "why bother" films of the 90s

 Overrated

 AWFUL!!!!

 Scorcese on steroids

 Two thumbs down!!!

 Ca-stinko!

 Not So Good, Fellas
