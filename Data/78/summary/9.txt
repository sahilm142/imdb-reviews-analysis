 A touching end

 Fitting closure to the 'Star Wars' series, now out on DVD.

 One Of The Best In The Series

 Strongest of the Series Besides Episode 4

 The end of the Star Wars saga?

 Very good, if not perfect 'Jedi'

 Underrated, and completely satisfying

 One of the most satisfying conclusions in any trilogy

 When a tiny ray drew the entire galaxy to the Light ...

 Emotionally Powerful

 Probably my favorite Star Wars movie

 The Best Star Wars Movie.

 Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi

 very underrated film.

 Good movie, but...

 "The Final Desperation Of Cinema"

 Overall: not the best episode, but it is impossible to hate.

 Celebrate the love

 My favourite in the entire series

 The Best of the Original Trilogy!

 Best of the Star Wars Trilogy.

 Return of the Jedi

 Quite good. Too bad the storyline wasn't as interesting as the first two.

 Overly Criticized
