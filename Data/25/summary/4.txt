 Kill me but I didn't like it...

 Think again

 Probably the most undeserving movie on the IMDb top 250 list

 The Triumph of the Human Spirit

 A Disney Holocaust

 Disappointing

 Probably the most overvalued film in history

 Life can be boring!

 Cinema has never been Benigni's best activity: this film stands as a confirmation

 Missed the mark

 Mediocre film that doesn't understand what it wants to be

 The most overrated Film of all time!

 irritating and overrated

 Very disappointing

 Be quiet!!!!

 A classic bore

 A comedy that features The Holocaust, try again!

 Allegory? Fantasy? Bullshit!

 Good, but nothing special

 Wan Comedy about Serious Historical Event

 Simply appalling

 Tone changes and ridiculous premise
