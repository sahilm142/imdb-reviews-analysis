 the world has gone mad

 Not Very Good, Nothing Like The REAL Mad Max!

 World makes no sense

 Irritating

 Had low expectations which were confirmed

 Only a visual show

 I am in awe...not of the movie but of the reviews..

 Worst remake of a classic series

 Not at all what I expected

 not as good as the originals

 unbelievably disappointing

 Honestly I don't understand what all the hype was for.

 How to turn a legendary name into dust (or is it sand)?

 If you've seen one Mad Max then this won't hold any surprises.

 They should have named it mad Maxine

 Bored in full for every dollar put in to making this crap

 Mild-mannered Max

 Marvel super heroes... only without the story

 Watch the originals - even Thunderdome was better than than this rubbish

 below mediocre movie

 Bad!

 2 hours of my life lost

 Unbelievably bad

 A Bad Road Trip...

 Wish i turned it off earlier.
