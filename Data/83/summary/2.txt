 The Most Over rated Art House Flick of 2000

 didactic hollering

 This movie is undeniably, extraordinarily... stupid

 YAWN!! Don't be fooled again ...

 Disgusting and Manic

 One of the most nihilistic things I've ever seen.

 pathetic trash nicely shot

 Visually painful, intellectually void

 Worst Movie Ever

 Not sure if this movie makes me want to do drugs or abstain.

 its the ending that ruins it (spoilers!)

 Real life is much more shocking and vivid, totally overrated movie!

 Sadism as Film Genre

 Preachy, Pretentious Filth.

 Over-rated and over hyped

 One of the most overrated films of all time

 Got tricked...

 Trying too hard!!

 As Nancy Reagan would say...

 Well, THAT was a waste of a good title.

 One word: overrated

 Soul-destroying

 One of the worst stories

 If You Become Addicted To Drugs...

 Ignorant film, just trying to scare you
