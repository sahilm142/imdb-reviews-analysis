Why oh why? They inserted the everyone-hates world of politics into The Phantom Menace thereby securing it as the worst of the Three Trilogies. So what numbskull decided what was awful for Phantom Menace would be good for Young Justice?! It's producers Vietti/Weisman and/or the execs in charge of production Bastion/Jones. Palace politics and literal backstabbing work no better here than there, and I couldn't endure past ep 3, just - too - boring. Yes, there are action sequences but they don't stand out in any way, the animation is pretty flat, the colors dulled/muted, not at all created for today's OLEDs and HDR fabulosity. Punt.
