 Thank god I postponed watching this movie until I am in the right..... mood!

 Stunning

 Pure romance

 Subtle and careful movie about love, commitment and betrayal

 A Teasing, Tempting & Transporting Illustration Of Love, Longing & Loneliness

 Visually Stunning!

 Lush in its portrayal

 Minimalism through Kar Wai's film

 Excellent focus play through less emotional outbursts

 A new film experience

 This May Hurt a Little

 refreshing, and beautifully melancholy

 a masterpiece

 Another great film by Wong Kar-wai

 Clever Romanticism

 Great romantic movie, if you are in the mood for it
