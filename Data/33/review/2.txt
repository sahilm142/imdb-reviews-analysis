This has got to be one of the most overrated movies in history. What, pray-tell, is soooo scary about a man in a dress weilding a kitchen knife? No atmosphere, painfully tedious dialog, and a slow moving plot make this "classic" not worth seeing. how could anyone be frightned by this piece of rubbish? Not I. If you wanna be scared, go see "The Ring" or "Event Horizon", two very under-rated movies that scare while making you think. If you want to see a no brain, guy-with-a-knife slasher flick..or better yet, if you need help going to sleep, then by all means, rent "Psycho"
Okay, I'll agree that the shower scene is one of the scariest in movie history.  Hitchcock did an amazing job with that.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't measure up.  The scary start whimpers away into a movie of confusion that can only be described as creepy at best, dull at worst. It's a classic, but that doesn't mean it's good.
