If you ever watched Planet Earth or Life, then you will know what to expect with this nature documentary series, this time focusing on one specific environment that many animals inhabit. Sir David Attenborough narrates this series that takes a look at the coldest places in the world where some of the most beautiful and extraordinary animals, as well as people, live and survive through the four seasons, spring, summer, autumn and winter, all still remaining mostly cold. The places are specifically the Arctic and Antarctic regions, over and under the glaciers, icebergs and the icy sea, and the animals included in series are the polar bears, penguins, albatross birds, killer whales, arctic wolves, seals, ducks, musk oxen, minke whale and many more. The animals are of course the big draw, and with the help of the same brilliant camera equipment we see some of the most amazing footage in extra motion, it is a fantastic natural history documentary television series. Very good!
