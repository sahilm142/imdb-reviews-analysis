 The story - and the heightism - continues

 'Towers' works on almost every level, except one plot thread

 Am I wrong? How is this getting such high ratings?

 What Happened?

 "Stupid, fat hobbit."

 Excellent sequel in the definitive fantasy film trilogy

 Impressive looking

 Epic, spectacular and thrilling, but also flawed.

 sadly disappointing

 Did not have to see 20 minutes of CGI Castle Storming

 good film, but a letdown

 A great movie for the eyes, not the mind.

 It is an unneeded part,the story is better without it.

 A continuation, yes, but with a different tone.

 Best of the trilogy---7/10

 What happened to Faramir ????

 If it were "just" another movie, it would have been great...

 The "extended edition" should have been the primary release

 Not bad, but not great

 Not as good as I hoped for

 This movie is terrible.

 Not as good as the hype but does the trick.

 Hats off to Andy Serkis!

 Greater and better than the average, but fare from Fellowship
