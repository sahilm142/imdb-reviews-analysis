It is really interesting that a movie so enjoyed by some viewers can be so annoying for others. This is my general impression when I read reviews on IMDb. Pan's Labyrinth (PL) is the most typical example when it's completely incomprehensible for me how a movie can be so highly rated. The only amazing aspect of this movie is that so many viewers find it so great. OK, for sure it's visually beautiful and unusual in terms of story-telling technique, but the story is so unpleasant, one-dimensional and pointless that I just to wanted to get away from the cinema (which almost never happens).Since I do not understand how anyone can find this movie enjoying, I will just try help you people who get disturbed by the same movie elements as myself. So if you often find the following aspects annoying in movies you should be careful before buying a ticket to this one.* Over-simplification of evil through characters that are extremely bad for no obvious reason (black or white - no gray scales) * Extreme violence that is completely pointless and makes you feel sick* Sympathetic characters that you are supposed to sympathize with immediately without really getting to know them * Two parallel story-paths (fantasy vs reality), none of which has any absorbing plot, and are completely unrelated to each other during most of the movieNormally I hate when people express their anger and give a 1 star rating because they hate a movie that everyone else finds so great, so the only good thing about PL is that I can at least start to understand how people can become so angry with a so called cinematic masterpiece.PS. My interpretation is that PL is a movie for artistic people that enjoy getting emotional through fuzzy fairy tales about good and evil, whereas it is not a movie for thinking people that wants to attain a higher understanding of the good and evil in man with some structure and logical congruence in the end. OK, PL actually has some congruence in the end, but this doesn't save a movie that is simply repugnant from start to finish.


                
Filmed well, but darkly, Pan's Labyrinth is a nonsensical tale of a little girl's adventures through a fantasy world of grotesque creatures and places as she escapes the equally grotesque reality of her worldly situation. Ofelia is step-daughter to a sadistic captain of the guards of an area of Franco's Spain still under guerrilla threat of the residual partisan opposition. The fantasy elements of the movie are pointless and shockingly boring. They are full of unexplained sickening creatures, insects, fairies, and FX hamming.The stupid insurrection fleshes out scenes of the real world. But the picture is reasonably interesting when the Captain is pursuing his cruel regime and investigations. A servant and some others are sympathizers with the Resistance while working in the Captain's own household. Ofelia's pregnant mother is carrying the Captain's child. The Captain himself is compelling and is clearly no coward. The movie is at it's meager best when he is on screen.Why is the insurrection 'stupid'? Well, we know, of course, that the Franco regime survived and the insurrection did not. So, we cannot hope to see the rebels prevailing in the long run. This makes their cause and their actions meaningless.The movie commits the cardinal sin that a movie can commit: the death of a child by violence. Try though they might to dress that up with a scene of Ofelia's reunification with her (by that time dead) mother and natural father in the hereafter, the fact remains that this child has been killed.The movie is well-shot and well-acted. It is relentlessly dark and depressing. And worst of all, it makes no sense whatsoever. Nor is it interesting. Despite all the fantasy and harsh reality, this is basically an extremely overlong and boring movie. A true waste of two hours.
This movie suffers from a very poor script based on a fabulous idea. The real story is Ofelia finding out who she is and gaining access to the fantasy world. Sadly, only about 15 minutes of the film is about this story. The rest of the time is spent convincing the audience that The Captain is an evil, horrific person. Um, yeah, you made that clear in his first two scenes. The audience gets it - he's BAD. What at all does the captain or the underground resistance have to do with progressing the real story of Ofelia completing her tasks to become a princess? Simply ridiculous that 75-80% of the script is spent on the non-story. A brilliant core plot gone to waste.The movie does have great cinematography and acting, but none of that is any good when you have a bad script.


                
I always give a film credit for trying hard, and "El Laberinto del fauno" does try awfully hard (especially its visual effects), but it isn't even a halfway great film and nowhere near deserving of inclusion in the IMDb's top 250 films of all time list. One of the best of 2006? Maybe. One of the best of the 2000s? No. One of the best of the last 100 years? Not even close. I can only assume that the people who rank it an 8 or higher have seen very few truly great films or they put an extraordinary weight on visuals and art direction (which are very good in this film) and don't care much about acting, characters, dialogue, or plot (which are all pretty average in this film). The fact that it's a foreign film probably makes it more appealing to some Americans.A few of the many problems in this film: The characters are basically one-dimensional and not nuanced or interesting in any way. For example, the captain is a sadistic brute all the time. Some sadistic brutes can show a charming side when they want to and keep their real nature hidden, but this captain never does. Which leads to a plot problem: Why would the woman marry him? Okay, maybe women can't get along without a man in fascist 1940s Spain. But was there no other choice? Or maybe she had to marry him so there'd be a movie. Next: The girl/princess is supposed to complete three tasks and if she fails, her chance to return to her fairy home is gone ... and she does fail, so the rules are changed to "if you fail, maybe the faun will change its mind and give you another chance". And how can a toad, even a really big one, cause a tree to die? And why it have a key in its belly? What is that monster with its eyes in its hands? Okay, it's "whoa, dude, cool" to look at, but does it have any internal consistency with the rest of the fantasy? Are any of the fantasy sequences internally consistent? Do the characters in the fantasy have any motivations or story of their own? Or do they all exist just to be "metaphorical" and impress the pseudo-intellectuals? Does the fantasy have any connection to the real world, or to the girl? If not, then the problem is we have two separate movies: a fantasy and a war story, neither of which is given the time needed for a complete telling. And why does the captain put a razor against his mirror image? Is it supposed to mean something? For me, it seemed just another impressive visual that is essentially empty because it is unconnected to anything in the character, dialogue, or plot. A Plot problem: Why didn't the housekeeper kill the captain when she had the chance (when he was on his knees with her knife in his mouth)? Why let him live? Oh, yeah, so he can appear in the final climax. Etc. To sum up: Some cool effects to look, but not much else. Don't bother.
I was very excited to see this film. It got excellent reviews and looked incredible from the previews. The previews lie the the reviewers lie. There is nothing in this film worth seeing; unless of course you like gratuitous gore.The film begins with young Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen traveling to a remote mill in rural Spain in 1944. The Spanish Civil War is officially over, but the fascist government is still fighting guerrillas in the countryside. They are traveling because Carmen has recently married a officer in Franco's army, Captain Vidal.Early on in the film several characters are rather transparently labeled as "good" and "evil." We see Mercedes, a maid in the household, rather clumsily helping the rebels. And we see Captain Vidal brutally murder a farmer.Vidal's men captured two farmers who were hunting for rabbits. They are interrogated, and then accused of being Communists. When the younger farmer pleads innocence, Vidal smashes him in the face with the bottom of a wine bottle. After two blows, the farmer falls out of the shot.This where the film and I parted ways. Instead of continuing to show Vidal beat on the man just out of the frame, we're treated to a close up of Vidal smashing the bottle into the man's face at least ten times until nothing is left but a bloody pulp.Vidal's men can look away in disgust. Why can't the camera afford us the same courtesy? After this gratuitous brutality, we're treated to a later scene where Mercedes, finally discovered by Vidal, pulls out a paring knife that she had hid in her dress, cuts the ropes that bind her wrists and then attacks Vidal. She doesn't kill him of course, she just stabs him in the back, in the stomach, and then cuts a gash across his face giving him a "Joker" smile. We're again treated to close-ups of this wound while Vidal's men look away in disgust. And then we're treated to an excruciatingly unnecessary minute long scene of him stitching up his cheek, and then drinking a shot of liquor that creates a great deal of bleeding (aparently for comic effect).Ofelia's fantasy world (which is what the movie trailers claimed the movie was all about) account for possibly 15% of the entire film. Many people have claimed that the fantasy land is a metaphor for what's going on the real world, or her way of coping, yet Ofelia never witnesses the brutality of her step father.In the end Carmen dies, Dr Ferreira dies, Vidal dies, Ofelia dies, and I couldn't really care.
As i was looking for any great films i might have missed over the years i came across this.At first it seemed pretty good rated so i decided to watch it...Big mistake.The whole 2 hours I was hoping it would cut it with the real world Spanish war drama crap and go to wonderland already.It was like watching Alice in Wonderland but without wonderland and with some twilight-esquire lets talk about our feelings crap.Most over-rated movie I have ever come across.It's up there with New Moon as the most horrific movies I've ever watched.The flat ending smashed any hope i had of it being at least decent. Was hoping for some gruesome stuff coming out of the whole "open the portal" thing, i was really hoping the whole princess thing would be just a hoax.This is NOT a fantasy film!Thats just the commercials in between the soap opera.
I have extremely mixed feelings about this film. Although the performances were excellent, the film itself relies on the 'gimicky' mixture of 'fantasy' and brutal wartime reality to make its mark. In and of themselves the wartime scenes and the fantasy scenes were nothing new until combined together. Each considered separately could be considered extremely derivative.I disliked this film intensely for its cruel treatment of the young girl (its central character). This film's sole differentiating factor relies on a telling the tale of young girl's tragic journey into first escapism, then delusion and finally death. It is to date the singularly most depressing film I have seen in a good long while.In the beginning (before we even arrive at the cinema) we are led to believe this a fantastical tale of a faerie world. This may bring to mind positive images for some. However Guillermo taps into the darker side of faerie, capturing the true menace and duplicitousness of that otherworldly breed. It is NOT for children. It is not for adults who expect something magical. Expect grotesque, twisted motives from equally grotesque characters both faerie and otherwise.We are introduced to Ophelia as an precocious and creative child. Eventually cast aside by her mother in favour of her new baby, abused and rejected by her mother's demented new husband and bereft of all hope she invents a new world of faerie to escape into. So begins her moral, intellectual and mental decline.As events unfold and and the adults win and lose their various battles, her descent into delusion goes largely unremarked until she steals her baby brother to sacrifice him and open the gates to the faerie world where she imagines she will be a faerie princess, beloved of faerie parents. You could be mislead into believing that this is actually the case yet, if you watch closely, all the signs that the world is entirely of her own creation and in fact completely imaginary are there.The darkness of the world she creates is a reflection of her failure to truly escape the bleak brutality of the world she really inhabits. What is more, the 'sacrifice' demanded by the faun is a dark reflection of her own desire to reverse the reality where in fact she is the one who has been sacrificed (cast aside). At the last minute could we say that she changed her mind? Or could we say that she recognised her own immorality in such a way that she couldn't accept it and fled once more into her dark world seeking solace and reassurance.We never discover. She is shot by her stepfather and dies. There is an extremely powerful moment where the maid (Mercedes) rebukes the step father and takes the baby after which justice is served. Then we see Ophelia in her dark faerie world being welcomed by her faerie parents just as she had imagined, a scene which even she must recognise with her last breath as too good to be true when the faerie parents so resemble her actual human parents.The extent of personal delusion and the brutality of the personal consequences are worthy themes but they are far too adult to be justifiably played out through a child character. In so doing, Guillermo has achieved a shock effect, however relying on such tactics as the central driving force of the film seems cheap and to be frank, left a bitter taste in my mouth. This man should apply his considerable talent with more care and discernment.We don't learn anything from this film. We simply suffer. And where's the magic in that?
This Spanish-Mexican film, also known by the title 'Pan's Labyrinth' (nothing to do with Peter Pan, in case you're thinking that because of the "Pan"), is not what it seems. This films fools anyone who is expecting a fantasy film. It happened to me. I didn't hear about this movie until some time before I watched it. Despite me not knowing very well what to expect from it, I expected a movie of fantasy and magic. Something in the line of 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Labyrinth' but better than 'Labyrinth'. But it ended up not being anything of what I imagined. And not in the good sense...Aside some beautiful backgrounds/landscapes and a relatively well made labyrinth, most of the movie is horrible. It is violent in the maximum sense of the word. No kidding. It's not a movie with just one or another brief scene of violence. There is brutal violence in many scenes. It's too much and that is something unacceptable on a movie like this. I wasn't prepared for the excessive violence in this movie and wasn't expecting it. I mean, one thing is a movie being violent if its genre or story justifies so. By this, you accept better its violence, even if it's brutal. But not on something that is supposed to be a fantasy/magical movie suitable for everyone including children. I can handle violence in films (even if it's brutal), as long as it is in an acceptable level and not excessive. But this one was too much for me to handle. There are far too many shocking scenes that I could mention, but I won't go into that. See for yourself and judge for yourself, but be warned: this ain't pretty to view.To tell the truth, only about 10% of the movie has fantasy and even those moments of fantasy have no charm... in fact, they are more dark (in a bad way) than a revelation. This is a strange film. It seems like 3 or 4 completely different films in one, all different in temperament and such. It's a disturbing and very bad movie.The story takes place in Spain in the year 1944, a few years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Franquist period. The character Captain Vidal is so tyrannical and brutal that he deserves his comeuppance, but his men aren't any better than him.As for the characters that belong to the fantasy part of the movie, I liked the stick insects, the fairies and the mandrake. But the Faun annoyed me. Not only he looked repulsive and was irritating, but also his disturbing intentions about the baby were alarming. The Pale Man was so grotesque and disgusting that words are incapable to describe how much that thing disgusts me.And this movie is as acclaimed as it is? And is considered one of the best foreign movies and even is on Top 250? I'm shocked. I'll never watch this again!


                
Just seen the movie only now out on Swedish screens. What a disappointment. I prepared myself for a beautifully done fantasy movie (judging from the trailers and the awards) and instead... instead I had a few scenes of fantasy in the context of a pseudo-historical Z movie, with trashy violence (that I found completely non functional to the story) and psychologically inconsistent characters. The movie looses tracks so many times you start thinking you are watching something that has not yet gone through a serious cut. Yes, you will notice a lot of post-production, but what about the cohesion and the necessity of the different scenes... do they hold? Ajajaj Gullermo Del Toro... what did you want to do with this movie? Why couldn't you choose a theme? You ended up making a weak hybrid that does not convince either the fans of splatter nor the fans of fantasy movies.Go back to school.


                
I just don't get it. The "real" world elements portrayed here make a satisfying story although somewhat obvious and lacking in subtlety. Nevertheless I could happily have watched a version of this film if it had no fantasy elements and at least had a cathartic experience based on the bad guy getting what he deserved. But the fantasy elements just did not fit here. Firstly they were strictly fantasy 101 - oh, the girl goes on the hero's journey represented by the journey into the underworld where she has to perform a series of tasks to prove her worth. Secondly they had no relationship to the real world events. Thirdly as the message was presumably that she escaped from the real horrors by fantasising, then why bother with the complex symbolism? If you want fantasy then "Lord of the Rings" does better than this at portraying the horrors of war. If you want the real horrors of war then there are a zillion things you could watch, staring with Apocalypse Now and working down from there. I'm a big fan of fantasy and I'm a big fan of realism but this attempted combination just does not work on either count. This film will appeal to those who fancy themselves as intellectuals and like reading magical realist novels that win literary prizes. I would think that most fantasy fans, who can discern the subtext of a story in a heartbeat, and most of those who are moved by a war film can only be baffled by the praise heaped upon this entirely pedestrian film that tries to succeed by bludgeoning the viewer with the obvious. I repeat; I just don't get it.


                
This movie is unbelievably overrated. As a movie, of course, it is not the worst movie to watch, and I am not saying that. All I am saying is that this movie is horrifyingly disappointing and overrated, IN MY OWN OPINION. I have talked to other people, and most have loved it. Maybe it is just me, but I found it stupid, pointless, and a waste of time, when I could have been watching other movies. I have heard people continuously complain about how it didn't win "Best Foreign Language Film" at the Academy Awards, and I have no idea what those people are talking about, it is a totally unsatisfying movie experience. It is utterly a depressing and unbelievably stupid movie. Again, it may not be the worst movie in the world, but it is completely overrated and disappointing.


                
This movie was horrible, definitely a waste of my time. In my opinion this movie has such a simple plot and structure to it that people tend to overrate it because it gives off a mystical complex idea of a plot that is easily understood yet requires the intelligence of a 1st grader to understand. I've noticed so many people calling it a superb and spectacular fantasy, what makes it such a great fantasy? is it the guy with eyes in his hands? the big frog? or the faun and his fairies? because those are the only fantasy elements in this movie, plus I don't understand why the faun would give her a second chance at immortality after she eats the food off that creepy thing's table, I feel it was just the failed attempt to add suspense and to integrate why that thing would chase after her. I've also noticed many people analyzing this movie's simple metaphors and themes if you're looking for a real movie to analyze check out Donnie Darko. Although I did enjoy the guy with eyes in his hands. Definitely a movie to watch just to say you've seen it, but it will be a waste of your time.
On the surface this sounds like a very intriguing and entertaining film. The juxtaposition of fairy tales and childhood innocence with the horrors of war seen through the eyes of a little girl sounds like a good backbone to a movie.However, Guillermo Del Toro fumbles big time. with a directorial style that nearly put me to sleep. Del Toro manages to make scenes with faeries, Faun's and flesh eating monsters dull, that in itself is an amazing talent. The magical and fairy tale elements of the film are about as uninteresting as the main focus of the movie, the villain.This movie spends so much time trying to shove the idea down my throat that the general in this movie is a maniac that it looses a little more every time this horribly over-acted character was on screen.The characters, the sets, everything until the final credits was an exercise in mediocrity and boredom.The sole interesting thing in this movie were the creature effects showcased in the movie, as with Hellboy, they are done masterfully.Unfortunately, also like Hellboy, this film contains many amazing looking things and very little substance and very little reason to care about anything you see on screen.


                
Pan's Labyrinth is both too childish for adults and too adult for children. A young girl approached by fairies in the woods to complete some gruesome tasks so that she might become princess in an underground kingdom, juxtaposed with guerilla warfare, torture, and maternal death. Does one really wish to see a girl reading magic books, followed immediately by repeated face stabbings? It is the most repulsive fairy tale you could imagine.Much of the cinematography is stunning, but whoever offered the filmmakers a discount on the crane has done us all a great disservice, as the cameraman is unable to keep his hands still, and as if the ugly subject matter wasn't for the stomach enough, we spend the entire film in aimless motion, getting sea sick on dry land. Worse is the script and its numerous logical flaws, which see characters doing many unbelievable things a vast majority of the time. I guess if they cared as much about the script as the camera moves, this never would have made it to screen.


                
Another one of those anointed films that people have to make junk up about to rationalize their obsession. Bottom line is: lots of people these days love to watch films that are about little more than CRUELTY ... slasher films, supposed psychological thrillers, and others. At the end of the day, they're just an excuse to sell tickets via showing cruelty. So, this film takes that path but adds a fairly good story and some good acting and some a strange interaction between a 20th century civil war and fairy tale darkness. Contrary to the opinions of some here, no those two worlds did not blend well. That is one of the fundamental problems with the film. We can spend hours finding ways the two worlds may intersect, ways the two themes speak to universal truths, but, hey, why don't you just go back to flippin burgers. In this film, they clash, not blend. Discord, not harmony.At least, unlike others who were disappointed, I didn't have "unsurmountable expectations". Even so, I was disappointed. I agree that it feels half-baked and the fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Contrary to the opinions of some here, the pale creature is not "devastatingly creepy". He is interesting. He is well done. He is in the film for about 2 minutes. In those 2 minutes, he does nothing really creepy.Another fundamental problem is that, other than the girl, nobody is really likable. You know, it would have helped if we could have liked the mother, at least. Or, if Mercedes wasn't so stupid that she didn't kill the Captain. Really. Who with half a brain says, "You won't be the first pig I've gutted!" to someone lying helpless on the floor, and then turns around and runs away ... with little hope of escaping and no real idea that running away sooner really makes escape more likely. Just dumb writing. I won't bother with other holes.


                
The trailer sells it as some kind of fantasy adventure... well it's not. 80-90% of the movie deals with the civil war in Spain in the 40's. So it completely misled me. Given that, I was willing to give it a chance, but really I just wanted to scream "GET TO THE POINT!!" in the middle of the show.Of the fantasy scenes that were in it, there was some cool stuff, but there could have so much more. It ended up just being boring. The intro seemed forced or contrived. The directing was pretty good. The anti-hero was so cruel he didn't seem real at all. The costumes were the best part. The conclusion made me go "Is that it? That was the most obvious ending... that couldn't be the real ending." On the positive side, I liked the fact that, as she was being guided, you didn't know whether to believe her guide or not. As an innocent observer you were conflicted with the main character's choices, as she was. It made it climactic, in a sense, when you found out what was the truth.


                
There are many factors in this film which - in theory - would make it right up my street. The historical context of a dark time in 20th century Europe; the conflicting characters and the chance for a close-up look at a really convincing bad guy; apparent reference to ancient pagan gods and so on. And fabulous write ups and sparkling recommendations from friends, too.All I got was a fairy tale. With your actual fairies in it. Maybe my expectations were raised unduly by the translation - this guy isn't Pan, he's a faun. The fantasy factor here isn't dark, weird or terrifying - it's childish, like another Harry Potter. The history doesn't fascinate me. The violence doesn't give me a chilling sense of the horror of the regime - it's just horrible. The question of whether I'm dreaming - frankly I thought A Nightmare On Elm Street did it better (seriously - and I cringed less at the bloodthirsty bits in that one).Now I fully expect the fantasy fans to go bonkers for this, it has marvellous animation in it, and a plot formula that seems to match other films fantasy fans love (generally I don't like them, either, sorry). But why this appeals to film fans? I am at a loss. The stats show highest scores from under 18s, which is fair enough, but the mean scores are very high across the board. Everyone likes it, but I can't think of anyone - beside those who dress up as Frodo at the weekend - who I'd recommend it to. Beats me.


                
It was beautiful on a technical level. But I thought the story stunk. You have the Spanish civil war story and the little girl in Wonderland story. They never really mesh, except for when the wicked stepfather shows up in the labyrinth at the end. And do I really need to see a giant frog barf up what looks like a corn muffin with raisins, or a guy sew his own cheek together? If the filmmakers would have spent less time on unnecessary gore and more time on telling a coherent story, they might have had something. What story there was move forward at a snail's pace. So if you're curious to see what the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe would be like if it dropped acid and spoke Spanish, then this is the movie for you. This movie seems to be getting a of acclaim, but I just don't get it. To me it was just a big boring surreal mess.
An extraordinary effort all for naught. The script presents us with two stories that are compelling in their own right, but when combined here are incomplete and ultimately unsatisfying. The story about the Spanish authorities tracking down guerrilla rebels is fine, although the brutal act of the Captain in charge are almost too much to be believed (his comeuppance at the hands of his maid is still a high point). The supernatural elements add nothing to this story. Ofelia's journey to regain her underworld throne has nothing to do with the activities of the Franco government, or her mother's marriage to the Captain. The ending makes both of these points more than clear.Del Toro would have served his audience better to have made two separate films from the elements he created, giving himself a chance to refine the characters and situations in each story. As it is, everything here seems arbitrary, and a bit over the top, and unconnected.
OK, let me start by saying there were a few things about the movie that I did like. I thought that some of the visual effects were very nicely done. The character of Pan was very well designed. The creature with eyes in its hands was adequately creepy. The frog was an interesting concept.Here is what I really couldn't stand about the movie... Please be warned this does contain spoilers!!!! If you have not seen it and you don't want the movie ruined for you, stop reading now.First of all the preview of the movie makes it look phenomenal! That is what drew me in to see the movie in the first place. Then the first killing with the man getting his face bashed in repeatedly with the butt of the gun. Yeah... that was stupid. I realize that they were trying to point out the cruelty of war, but that was just pointless. The trailer leads you to believe that that is the Spanish reply to Narnia... then you get the first make-shift horror gore. I understand that the movie was R rated for a reason.. but when you make a movie that is projected as being an adult science fiction, the gore just ruined it. If I wanted to see that I would have gone to see whatever slasher film is currently being released.My other big problem is that the title really has very little to do with the movie. The word Labyrinth in its simplest form is a maze. I realize that they are trying to say that the tasks that Ofelia was sent on are complex series things that she must do, and that is where they are referencing the idea of a "Labyrinth". But that is not the direction that we are lead to believe the movie will be going in. When I saw the first preview of the movie I was under the impression that Ofelia was going to enter an actual labyrinth. The previews lead you to believe this by showing you things that are not the outside world. They should have shown more of Ofelia in the real world.Ending spoiler beyond this point! Ofelia is crazy... yes she is out of her skull insane, hallucinating right until the very end. There is nothing to show that she truly enters this new world... they show her dead body at the end. So with her last ounce of life she hallucinates that she is still living in this new glorious world.As someone that has a passion for movies, this one was bitter end. Usually I can find something of worth within most of the films that I see, even if I don't think it was incredible. With this one, I saw it once, and I will most likely not watch it again. It really wasn't all that good... and I hate saying that because I do like most of Guillermo del Toro's movies.
While every person I know who has seen the movie professed their deep and passionate love for the film, apprehension did come over me as I gazed at the DVD cover and saw, "From the director of BLADE II and HELLBOY" in text placed right above the title. My apprehension was not misplaced, I was bored to tears and became increasingly restless as the movie plodded on. Surely, my time could have been invested more fruitfully elsewhere. Pan's Labyrinth was a waste of my time, and in my opinion a poorly made movie.It really is odd that Pan's Labyrinth was advertised as a fairy tale (or even as a "fairy tale for adults"). Instead, it is a movie with a girl who is obsessed with fairy tales, but not a "fairy tale". Part of the criteria for fairy tales is that they happen outside of time ("once upon a time"), not actual historical times. As well as that they operate outside of a 100% concrete location (they instead happen in non-existent lands where fantastic things can take place). Pan's Labyrinth happens in 1944 and in Spain. Trust me, it is in no way a fairy tale, look up the definition of fairy tale and you'll see that Pan's Labyrinth has nothing do with them whatsoever.The directing in Pan's Labyrinth leaves something to be desired, while it is not atrocious, Guillermo Del Toro comes off as lazy, semi-incompetent, and complacent. The 180-degree rule is broken about a handful of times over the course of Pan's Labyrinth seemingly out of laziness. While the rule can be broken by directors, such as it was done by Stanley Kubrick, to purposely disorient the viewer<U+0097>disorientation, that is never the intent of Pan's Labyrinth (which makes every attempt to effortlessly fuse fantasy and reality together, or so Guillermo Del Toro claimed). Instead when the rule is broken in Pan's Labyrinth, one can only assume it is a mistake made by Guillermo Del Toro. Guillermo Del Toro is unable to breathe life into the characters that populate Pan's Labyrinth; instead though his complacent directing, all of the characters are two-dimensional, unrelatable, and fail to inspire any concern from the viewer.The editing is annoying in Pan's Labyrinth (at first, only subtly, but as the film progresses, the repeated annoyances become antagonizing). The film is peppered liberally with unnecessary and misplaced dissolves that disrupt the flow of the editing, working against the movie (whenever a dolly-shot is used in Pan's Labyrinth-<U+0097>you can bet that there will be an unnecessary dissolve somewhere in the length of the dolly-shot... uh, why?). Match cuts made within Pan's Labyrinth feel gimmicky and self-satisfied. One of the best examples is during a montage that repeatedly cuts back between Ofelia lost inside her fantasies and her step-father leading a brigade of horsed soldiers as they ascend a forested hill, match cuts are made as the trunks of trees envelop the frame and become walls that surround Ofelia, and as the camera continues to pan right, the match cut is made again and again (beating the viewer over the head).The script is dull for the film and the characters within it as well. But not only are the characters in Pan's Labyrinth flat, dull, and unlikable<U+0097>-the protagonist's intelligence is irksomely inconsistent. Ofelia constantly demonstrates her lack of intelligence (or possession of even an inkling of common sense) over the course of the film, yet conveniently is able to figure out that the character of Mercedes is working with the Spanish resistance (also, Ofelia's sudden knowledge of the existence of resistance fighters in the woods that she only recently arrived in is left unexplained... Seriously, the girl is as dumb as a rock, how did she figure those two things out?).***START OF POSSIBLE SPOILER*** Something that comes to mind when recollecting on the poor script, is the lack of any motivation for Ofelia eating the forbidden grapes of the Pale Man (instead, she gulps down two grapes knowing full well the warnings of death made by the Faun). Previously in the movie, Ofelia was sent to bed without dinner, but that was several nights previous in the course of the time line within the movie. If only the events were arranged to happen in the same night, Ofelia's greedy impulsiveness would actually make sense<U+0097>-instead of being motivationally random and merely convenient for there to be a brief scene of tension with the Pale Man chasing Ofelia.***END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER***Bottom line: Pan's Labyrinth sucks. If you thought it was a good movie, you desperately need to watch some films of higher quality.


                
I can understand why so many critics have been swept away by this contrasting tale of a brutal regime and the lovely but parallel dangerous fantasy world imagined by our young girl heroine. It's a "pretty" film balancing the real world against a not overly-CGIed imaginary one. But here's the crux of the problem: What is the point of this film? What deeper and interesting issues can the audience explore through the vision of the director and his story? My response: None. A simple tale and a simple vision of escaping from a desperate reality. We have the extreme visually graphic brutality of the general against many softer feminine elements (and virtuous feminine strength shown over and over again). So, good versus evil? A young girl's fantasy dashed? The "clever" blurring of her fantasy vs. reality? Nice touches that don't amount to anything deeper or more meaningful.On another note, I found the brutal elements too disgusting to watch and again wondered what was the point? A vicious villain's villain, yes. Geez, I never would have imagined that a man could be so cruel for no apparent reason than the absolute drive to conquer and dominate. That was some learning experience.
The thing got like a 96% positive rating on rotten tomatoes/meta-critic. Can't imagine what all the critics were inhaling in the theaters . Do we really live in era of such diminished expectations? The production values are beyond reproach, but it's a major disappointment - the plot was tiresome, the characters one dimensional clichés, violence gratuitous and the Christ allegory ending embarrassing. As a fair-tale, the magic realism elements were contrived and shallow. As an exploration of Spain's civil war during fascism it's laughably bogus. Also Mr. Director, if your inept main character shows less sense about her than my 2 year old niece, it's hard to take your film seriously .Worst 'foreign film' I've seen in a while.


                
The movie's fantasy scenes are great, and the best bit of the movie. But the rest of it was very much story by numbers. In fact it was melodramatic pap that wrote itself. The good guys were oh so good, the bad guy oh so bad, the characters clichéd as far as they could be, it was in the end kind of silly, which for a subject as bold as a civil war, is not good. The main girl also had more than a touch of Anne Frank about her visually speaking, which may have been just me, but again added to the trite feeling of the overall movieBut the fantasy scenes were really good, and if the movie focused more on these, rather than the rudimentary main storyline, it would have been better.


                
whoever said this can be compared to lord of the rings was a drunk moron. the story line is decent. the graphics for the creatures was interesting. overall it was a decent movie right up to the point where the commander gets stabbed. no one can get a "line cut" from shoulder to rib & still use that arm! then he gets stabbed in the chest destroying a lung but the writers ignore that effect & have him up & walking 2 minutes later! if that isn't enough, he gets a drug overdose which makes his vision blurry for 1 minute. none of the above wounds stop him from catching the girl who's running through the labyrinth. i wont tell you the ending but the last 1/4 of the movie stunk!
