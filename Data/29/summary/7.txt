 Littoral

 still, it does seem that they could have looked at more

 Not as great as you've heard

 A good film, but over-rated

 Excellent combat scenes - unrealistic dialogue

 Cut the first and last scene

 Good war film but...................

 'Saving Private Ryan' is a beautifully told, emotional and gripping war tale

 Brilliant movie even if too violent

 War movie unlike any other

 Well-executed, but essentially flawed

 Good, but not without faults.

 Great opening

 SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (DIDIER BECU)

 Pretty good, but has some definite flaws. Spoilers.

 standart spielberg exploitation

 Great battle scenes, but somewhat spoiled by many flaws.

 Well-executed movie but the point is unclear

 Technically awesome, the rest... almost there

 Realistic depiction of wartime battle (Major spoilers ahead)

 Could have been an 8

 Not your best Spielberg

 How to dismantle a great movie

 Movie about Hanks character with Pvt Ryan as an after though.

 O what a bloody war.
