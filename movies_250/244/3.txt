I have hardly seen a movie that is worth seeing less than this movie. And I'm usually a die-hard fan of G-rated movies. This movie is, by all means, appropriate for children, the kind that is nearly non-existent today, but it is still not worth seeing to a guy like me. I really don't like the songs that much, though Page O'Hara, the voice of Belle, did an exceptional job. Need I say anything about Robby Benson? He did great as the beast, and later when he was turned back into a human, as the prince.Other than the weird songs, it was OKay, but don't watch this movie unless you can put up with a 6-year old (daughter/sister) singing her head off.My Score: 3/20.
