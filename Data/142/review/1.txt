... and in *no way* as clean, logical, and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches.I'm 27, and I've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character in the film, I was successful mainly because of logic : because I kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality, and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. In the end, I was really successful because of medication, by the way, but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.So, I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. Not only does it cheat with the main character's story (who wasn't faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly, it shows a comforting, tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point.Schizophrenia is a mind structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic *isn't* a "normal man with a disease", it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people : for him, things like time, space, and people's personalities aren't solid things. He feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world which "normal" people don't expect - but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people, and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank, delusive dead end.This is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous "cure", tear-jerking movie. It should be violently frightening. People other than the main character should appear strange, weird and absurd, like in Lynch's "Eraserhead", for example. There should be *really* impressive, weird, gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about *details*.I mean, watch "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read P.K. Dick's "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", DO watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City", or play "American McGee's Alice" on PC, and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. Don't watch the "feel good" movie of the month, with banal situations, cleaned characters and visuals, and stupid plot tricks. "The Cell" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent, weird, confusing, and very, very scary.Once again, Schizophrenia isn't about details, it's not a neat, tame trick played to you. It jumps in your face and won't let you go : walls fall apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you go backward in time, you're not sure you're who you think you are, everything feels... strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap-like melodrama
Even if you ignore the fact that Nash's homosexuality was completely ignored by the film, what about his first son who was never mentioned? The one he failed to support financially. What about his strained relationship with his wife? What about the ridiculous and non-factual introduction of his imaginary friends, which are used as a Greek chorus by Howard and the writers, because they can't move the story along any other way. Don't waste your time with the movie, read the book which is infinitely more interesting and gives you a real sense of the human being. Not this badly directed and filmed Hollywood whitewash. Ron Howard is probably one of the least interesting directors working in Hollywood today. So save your time and money, watch the PBS documentary or read the book.
****SPOILERS AHEAD****I've heard it been said that this film is "not your typical Hollywood movie", in that Ron Howard stays away from overt sentimentality, swelling violins and other devices used to club audiences over the head and send them home in a euphoric, feel-good haze that doesn't dissipate until the last bought and paid-for Academy Award is handed out on Oscar night.Yes, Ron Howard stays away from overt sentimentality.  And he stays away from everything else, too.  Including moments that might reveal character, facts that would tell an honest, cohesive story and ANYTHING that would help make a captive audience believe in and care about what they're watching. Instead, we're led along through a series of hokey scenes showing John Nash at school, clearly AN OUTSIDER (watch how he upends a chess board!  thrill as he tosses furniture out of a window!  cheer while he launches a textbook into a garbage can and teaches the class HIS way!). Every time a moment comes along that might actually reveal character...SMASH!...cut to "two years later".  Then Nash meets a girl in his class whose only apparent attribute is that she has the balls to tell a bunch of construction workers to shut up.  Soon they're pointing at stars, then they're on a picnic then...BANG!...suddenly they're married!  The entire flick has this rapid, TV movie-like pacing.  Nothing is ever earned.  All of the scenes are thrown at us in neat, easy-to-digest, simple-for-a-big-dumb-audience-to-understand fashion.  Yet despite this rapid (vapid) pacing, the movie drags and sags.As for a lack of swelling violins, uber-composer James Horner - raising "Titanic" - reprises the syrupy flutes from that film, to indicate to the audience of this film that THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT.  And a good thing, too, because the routine acting and the banal dialogue sure doesn't.
Russell Crowe's acting is uneven at best.  In one scene he comes off as a shy, innocent dullard, then he's an arrogant prick, then back again.  I understand he's supposed to be schizophrenic but there's a certain measuredness - a balanced realness - that's required to make any performance credible - even a schizophrenic.  This is not displayed at all, and the result is that he lost my believability for the character and my sympathy for his situation.  Top that off with an Aussie accent one minute, then some fake-o West Virginia country boy twang the next, then back again....there's a hundred other actors that, despite the handicap of Ron Howard's direction, could have brought this role to life.  Don't get me wrong.  Russell Crowe is a great actor.  From "Romper Stomper" to "The Insider" he has given some amazing performances, but he was really the wrong choice here.Jennifer Connelly, so great in "Requiem for a Dream", gives a throwaway performance here.  In her defense, the role written for her is a WASTE. In scene after stilted scene, she plays the dutiful, suffering wife. Fine, she stuck with her husband throughout his "ordeal" (such as it was....this movie's idea of the torment of an unhinged mind boils down to a roomful of magazine clippings and yarn! scary!), but WHY!?  Why not invite the audience into her mind as well, show us her trials, her demons, her reasons for hanging on?  Certainly someone living with a schizophrenic 24 hours a day must have some story of her own to tell?  Where is the slow, measured wearing-down of HER sanity?  Instead we get a marginal acting job of a woman staring out a window with tears running down her face.  POOF!  Suddenly they have a child!  WHY!? Was this planned?  What are the ramifications now? How does Nash perceive the child?  When the baby almost drowns (a scene that could have been and should have been extremely harrowing and emotionally wrenching) I DIDN'T EVEN CARE!!Finally, it's unclear what this film is even ABOUT.  Schizophrenia? "Sybil" - a TV movie - was far more compelling, believable and informative.  A mathematician?  What did he accomplish?  Aside from the windowpane scrawlings at the beginning of the movie, I never saw him contribute anything mathematical.  A teacher?  There is about five minutes of film showing him teaching, but fails to detail his accomplishments, his inspiration to his students, his relationships with his peers and other faculty - NOTHING.  A Nobel Prize winner?  For what?  Admittedly, I fell asleep during the last five or ten minutes of the film, just prior to him making his big acceptance speech.  Perhaps I missed some bit of information, but what did he win a Nobel Prize for, being a psychotic jerk?  The movie neither shows nor tells anything that might support otherwise.
In short, this movie is by-the-numbers filmmaking, and continues to add to the less-than-lackluster directing talents of Ron Howard.  From what I understand, John Nash lived quite a colorful life that included womanizing, a nasty divorce, homosexual affairs, violent outbursts and strokes of mathematical genius that apparently changed our economic system.  Was any of this portrayed in this piteous, watered-down film? NO!!! Somewhere here there is a good, compelling story that should have been told by a better director - and a better writer (it's not solely Howard's fault).  Instead we get this manipulative, clap-trap crowd pleaser, showered with Oscar nominations and (rather appropriately) destined to take its place alongside "The English Patient".  It's unfortunate that John Nash's life was reduced to this treacle.  This "Beautiful Mind" was a terrible thing for Ron Howard - and Akiva Goldsman - to waste.
I cannot believe the people that rave about this movie.  "A Beautiful Mind" is a terrible thing to waste your time on.  The movie's direction is manipulative and the screenplay is horrid.  I thought this was suppose to be based on the true life of John Nash.  Didn't his wife divorce him in real life? Yes, she did.  Wasn't Nash a homosexual? (Nash says no, but.) Yeah, right, Mr. Nash.  Let's not use truths here let's just make up some stuff that an audience will like.  Well, Hollywood, I might have liked the movie more if his wife had divorced him or if there was a homosexual tinge to the film.  I needed to feel for the character and all this character was is a jerk.  Hell, he says it himself, "I have a chip on both shoulders".  The movie makes him come off as a womanizing jerk.  How can I care about him. Well, because Hollywood says we should feel for him and the media says it is a great film.  That's why we like it.  Give me a break.  I know this day will never come, but, I sure wish it would, when will people learn to make there own decisions about movies, music and tv shows, etc. instead of allowing themselves to be conned into liking something just because the media says it is good.  And, don't get me started on the Academy Awards because all that is now is a popularity contest.  The best films or actors or screenplays, whatever, might get nominated but they don't have a chance in hell winning, ie.  "Memento", "Ghost World", "Mulholland Drive", etc.


                
I have experienced schizophrenia first-hand: I have a brother suffering from the disease.I have also read Sylvia Nasar's brilliant biography of John Nash.Against that background, I have to say that the film "A Beautiful Mind" is a reprehensible example of filmmaking.It's a complete fabrication of the real story of John Nash. And it's also an irresponsible and grossly inaccurate picture of mental illness and its devastating effect on the family.This movie has taken a very sad story of a man with mental illness and turned it into an absurd fairy tale.That this film would be showered with awards is only more disgraceful. It shows how the elite in Hollywood are completely out of touch with reality.The true story of John Nash is not told in this film. Nor is it any way an accurate depiction of mental illness.It's nothing short of revisionist trash.


                
If this movie is the nadir of Hollywood dishonest trickery and whitewashed falsehoods masquerading as fact, how does one explain its popularity? Here are some clues: In the part where the film does talk about mathematics, it makes the viewer feel that he is more intelligent than he actually is, which is always a good idea when you're aiming for the lowest common denominator and you want your picture to sell tickets in the Ozarks as well as in Hollywood.In the part where the film talks about romance, the worst possible woman's picture clichés are dragged out to show Nash as "different" and desirable. In actuality, he was nerdish, odd and gay.In the part that talks about his schizophrenia, terrible care is taken to avoid mentioning the fact that the 1950's persecution of homosexuals had a lot to do with Nash's worsening condition. John Nash was forced to conceal his homosexuality and was persecuted for it by the same government that expected him to decrypt secrets for them and keep quiet about it. If that isn't enough to turn any brilliant mind into a paranoid-schizophrenic, I really don't know what is.In all the other parts, the bad script and the bad out-of-place acting by miscast actors are immensely aided by photographic special effects and by the music (or rather non-music) of James Horner, the inventor of today's omnipresent minimalist "fear music", where the cinema's sub-woofers are put to maximum use to make the viewer feel danger directly through his anal sphincter, the only part of one's anatomy that is actually needed to "enjoy" this film as written.


                
I really don't get all the adulation that this film has received. It's mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie Nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about tolerable, but what's with all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowe's performance is little short of caricature. It is also rather offensive. And, dare I say, just on the right side of being truly terrible


                
This movie is a premium example of hollywood taking a wonderful real life story, changing it altogether to make it edible for the general public and coming up with a movie full of lies. As just a movie, I can see some people will find it interesting. But the movie presents rubbish about Economics and Nash and, of course, game theory. Nash didn't invent game theory as the movie kind of tried to portray. He came up with a notion of equilibrium whoich is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel.  I think coming up with the equilibrium notion is more of a contribution than iventing game theory. But of course they had to change it to make it sexy enough. The movie is full of lies like this. I understand that most people will not enjoy the movie as much if it were truthful. Nevertheless, that doesn't change the fact that the movie lied about game theory. I think it was awful


                
Mental illness has never appeared so snuggly and warm. Watch Russell emote, tics a' flyin!  Watch lovely Jennifer Connelly start her descent into Calista Flockhearts diet zone! Listen to the heart tugging strings as the Ronnie Howard team schmaltzes up a good story and makes it all shiny and happy! The saccharine level was tough, but with enough salt from the popcorn counter I just about made it through. Never mind that the true story of this man is amazing, like Disney before him (and the glowy sitcoms that informed his 'early work') Mr. Howard takes a tough and beautiful story and grinds it down so that it's almost unrecognizable. Shameful how we eat it up.


                
I am not going to jump on this band wagon. What a boring movie. I kept thinking during the opening scenes that something was going to happen. I guess I fell asleep and missed the movie magic. What a bore. And from what I've read, the movie and the real life story are not even closely resembled.The characters are dull, the script goes nowhere. Reading all the comments from people blathering about the greatness of this slow motion picture, I would love to hear from real men what they think. But, to each his own. This movie was trying to be art, but so was "Vanilla Sky". It was another borefest in the same vein. This movie really brought out the weaknesses in Russell Crowe's acting.


                
First off, the movie was not true to facts at all. I just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. First of all Nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. At this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. Personally I think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we "lesser mortals". 5/10


                
The character had no redeeming qualities -- he was a loser, crude, no social skills -- why his wife ever married him is beyond me -- she must have been just as screwed up as him!  I had no interest in this undesirable character and things just got worse.The movie was depressing and I didn't think anything could redeem the movie, so I walked out before the end!  I don't know where the title "A Beautiful Mind" came from, because I never saw any hint of it!


                
I had such high expectations when I went to see 'A Beautiful Mind.' Russell Crowe. Jennifer Connelly. That guy from 'The Sound of Music.' Ron Howard. All these big names were attached, and it was based on a true story, so I was pretty excited about seeing it.Then, I saw the movie. I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed. The plot was thin and way too predictable (I knew from the get-go that the roommate was a figment of Nash's schizophrenic mind). And I didn't find some of the events that were triggered by Nash's condition to be very realistic. It felt more like I was watching a badly-written yet beautifully photographed after-school special. I just didn't experience Nash's fear the way he did. Maybe because I knew about the roommate, I can't be sure. But it the scenes with the agent just didn't do it for me. Overall, despite some of the awesome acting involved (Jennifer did deserve that Academy Award) and the beautiful cinematography, I felt like 'A Beautiful Mind' was overrated and nothing new. It was just too predictable, and after awhile, I really didn't care about the character of John Nash anymore. I wanted to hear more about how his wife and son coped, and I felt like we could have seen more contrast between the respect Nash got later in life with the skepticism and mockery he was met with when word of his condition became public.Sorry folks, but it stinks. If you want to see a good movie about mental illness and the people who cope with it, rent/buy 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.'
I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before I swear off his work entirely.  Having, unfortunately, dealt with Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now caught up in so many of Lucas' traits.  How else do you explain his rampage of disasters?  His only useful film, of course, has been 'Willow'.  Everything else, including this, is  too reliant on superficial junk.Some spoilers.He can't even have semi-intelligent focus like Peter Weir.  No, poor Howard so stuck on his Spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten.  Here we have the old adage:  "love conquers all, even disease."  Too bad for Howard that Lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill. Heck, even Disney did better than this.  Ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realities.Howard's commentary track is just awful.  Don't even rent the DVD.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud
This film is despicable garbage.  It has the bare-faced cheek to use a mental illness as an excuse to switch up cinematic genres and it's deeply offensive.  The first hour is completely incomprehensible filmmaking--why does no one, except the viewer, realise there's something wrong with Crowe, I mean, aside from all his bad acting?  Howard straight-jackets all the other actors to prolong his device of dual realities that once revealed, makes no sense whatsoever.  Why don't we as an audience view the sets as any normal person would and focus on Crowe's bizarre behavior?  Just so Howard can make us think we're watching a bad espionage thriller?  Why does every other actor in the film just stand around dumbfounded, forced to give maximus (erm, I mean, maximum) room to Crowe's showboating performance? And what were the details in Jennifer Connelly's pact with the devil to make this wretched film?  Her's is a great beauty that can be used to tremendous effect when a director knows what to do with (like Aronofsky in Requiem). Howard just heaps on the mascara and probably made her wear curlers to bed every night. I can only thank God there was a fire alarm in the cinema so I missed the wretched "old age make-up" scenes that looked likely to rival those in "For The Boys."  This is dire filmmaking and further proof--as if it were needed after the success of The Sixth Sense--that America has no culture.  Or taste.


                
Welcome to the Wonderful World of the West Coast - hey this one's for you fellas. Dull beyond belief. Poorly acted. The best I can say is it's cameo-like. A 'cinemography' which carefully leaves out all the nasty bits. Crowe saturation has been reached! Judging from this none of the characters here could act there way out of a paper bag - up there with some of the worst movies I have ever paid money to see. Who could forget the unforgettable "Some Good Men". This is worse.


                
I didn't notice any comments here bashing this film, so I think I'd better add one; in my opinion, this was one failed movie. The only three things that kept me watching it to ending were actor Russell Crowe, cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer James Horner.Actually, the film starts pretty good. The first half hour reminded me of quality British dramas (like Chariots of Fire), and had a few marvellous scenes. Just as I was starting to think this would be a good movie, it started to go drastically downhill.The filmmakers (Ron Howard, Akiva Goldsman) get drawn into what appears like two subplots - one about Nash's love affection and one about his paranoia of communist spies - and lose the conception of the film. There's been comments of the film as a tear jerker... Sorry? I didn't find anything emotional about this movie. Towards the ending, it just keeps getting more and more like a bad TV-movie. All characters are poorly written, there is not one single good dramatic scene; a *lot* of the screen time is stolen by imaginary characters (they actually feel more lively than the actual people in the movie).The acting is hopeless; the dreadful direction makes all characters except Nash seem like cameos and the screenplay really feels as it is written by the fellow who wrote Batman & Robin (dah).And the fact that the film isn't thruthful to its subject doesn't make it any better, either.


                
Moviegoers watch out! Russell Crowe is on the lose to bore you to death in this overacted, poorly crafted piece of Hollywood kitsch. Basically the movie is about the life and the fight with schizophrenia of John Nash, a college professor. So far so bad. As the story might have offered some interesting possibilities the film shows us Russell Crowe overacting as bad as he could possibly do. At no time through this 134 minute piece of boredom the viewer can actually believe that John Nash is supposed to be a mathematical genius. We rather get the impression of a clumsy, slighty overweighed farmer strolling around campus. The only reason one would stay in the theater is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris who delivers yet another great supporting performance. This is by no way an Oscar movie and I will cry bitter tears if Russell Crowe takes away the best male again. Avoid the movie!!


                
Unfortunately, Russell Crowe likely will win as Oscar for this one. Sad, because Tom Wilkinson deserves it for "In the Bedroom." Actually, Crowe shouldn't have even been nominated. Anthony LaPaglia was so much better in "Lantana," a film that was completely ignored.If not for Jennifer Connelly's performance, "A Beautiful Mind" would have made my worst films of the year list. She was the best and only thing about this film. The other characters, especially Nash, as played by Crowe, were thoroughly uninteresting. I couldn't care less whether he was delusional or not - he was a boring person. I don't believe a film needs to have sympathetic or likable characters to be good. But there was no one - other that Connelly's character - I cared about. And *****SPOILER ALERT*****is there anyone in the audience who did not see that pen scene coming a mile away?This was truly one of the most disappointing films of 2001. How it got so many Oscar nods is beyond me.
My cinema hobby is an escapist one, searching values in movies that our actual world ignores. So there's nothing worst for me that a movie that tramples morality and beauty. In this genre, this one ranks among high.It begins with the extras: 30 minutes of deleted scenes with Howard saying that they are all beautiful, perfect but it had to cut them because of the time. Where's the rule that says that this biopic must run 130 minutes exactly? The length is never fixed, it depends of the story.Then, he proposes a scene with his real father: "cut for show business". What are his values? Money over Family? One of the finest French director (Richard Berry) always finds a part (big or small) for his daughter in all his movies! Next, the movie starts and it's the carnival of Horror: To depict that the story happened in the 50's, Howard uses very strong golden colorization! Then, we have to believe that Crowe is a 22 years student! And ice on the cake: his delusions are "real", which is total nonsense. In other words, the director found brilliant to embody his delusions like normal people. I didn't know that mental illness was a fairy tale! All the power of this drama is killed at birth and it's a shame. It reminds me of the french movie "l'adversaire" that stars also a psychotic. This one cheats all his family for years and it's his ultimate moment that reveals his madness. With that climax, our french "Howard" thought also brilliantly to start the movie by the end! Well, the great error of this biopic is to treat illness like a thriller, a spy movie. Others much talented directors (Lynch) can really depict what is madness and a dangerous reality.Sadly, Jennifer isn't acting so wonderful to earn her Oscar instead of Crowe, who is really convincing as a big man becoming very fragile. If you add that the story eludes his first child, his homosexuality and his divorce (!) and that you saw all the Oscars it won, I conclude that Hollywood has really gone psychotic now! NB: My real anguish with that itself but the fear of the psychosis. Now, i don't see or hear delusions but I'm afraid to face them in the future. So am i already psychotic and i don't know it actually ?
this moive was such a sterotypical drama it was only made to win awards. it wasn't even in the top 25 best reviewed films of the year so why did it get nominated for best pic.  lord of the rings was robbed it was more popular and was the best reviewed film of the year and unlike a beautiful mind, people are actually going to remember lord of the rings years from now. memento was also robbed it should have been nominated for best picture also.4/10


                
I am afraid to say that this is yet another example of Hollywood creating their own sanitized version of someone's life. What purports to be a biography is not - all the parts which may upset an American audience have been left out. Couple this with a wonderful example of incredibly bad acting from Crowe (I liked him in Gladiator and LA Confidential) and I am amazed that this got any Oscar nominations at all. If this film wins it will be a complete travesty.


                
This is another hit for Bettany, and another dialed-in crapfest from Crowe. I do NOT GET the adulation awarded this film by critics. The screenwriters have completely bastardized a better story.Just for the sake of correctness, Nash didn't invent game theory as this work attempts to claim. He came up with a notion of equilibrium, which is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel. But Crowe does NOT. This was supposed to be a historical film, but due to Crowe's lackluster performance, backed up by his aggressive contractual negotiations, his character has been given credit for things he did not do! In a learned person's opinion, this is an irresponsible, and disgraceful film mainly due to Crowe's contractual screen time, which necessitated giving his character credit for things he should not have been portrayed as having done, and his totally crappy, dialed in performance.This was a typical Hollywood whitewash of the truth, and a typical Hollywood performance by Crowe. When will they just STOP handing this untalented hack roles like this?! It rates a 0.6/10 from...the Fiend :.


                
WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILER INFORMATION.I wonder how much of this bio tale is accurate. The first half, full of paranoid fantasies, was somewhat entertaining, but the whole thing evolved into a disappointing "feel good" ending. There is absolutely nothing about mental illness that ever  "feels good". Ron Howard beat out Robert Altman for this mess? What a travesty!  Mr. Howard didn't know what to do once he let us know that the character was just imagining the best part of the drama. I wanted to know more about how Dr. Nash spent his "just hanging out" time at Princeton. Like most people, I am intelligent enough to understand more about  Dr. Nash's work than the movie let us see.Sam Neil, not Russell Crowe, was the best actor in the picture. And why was the woman who played the wife even nominated for an Academy Award? Granted, she is very pretty and had one scene where she actually lost her genteel temper, but it was not award winning acting. The Academy must have been desperate for nominees. Will someone please explain why Russell and so many other actors have to mumble their lines? Is line mumbling some new hip style that I am too un-hip to recognize?
Russel Crowe proves to be a decent actor, going from college to shaking old man, his acting and the make-up artist who worked on him did a great teamwork. On the other hand, Jennifer Connelly does not age well throughout the movie, and this is critical in supporting the creativity of using a cinematographic gaffe to visualize a concept dealing with the beautiful mind in question. And suddenly, the make-up ages her so strangely that she looks pretty darn close to Helena Bonham Carter from Planet of the Apes! Plot twists a la "The Others"--to name something other than that movie with Bruce Willis and the kid, keep you watching, and moments of brilliance such as the theory with which John Nash proves John Adams wrong using a blonde and her friends, build up the expectations which are completely blown off by the less than satisfactory shallow talk on which the movie ends. When strings of movies came out as Pulp Fiction wannabes (the original itself from a John Woo wannabe), things were recognizably bad. Now that Night Shamalyan wannabes bring out their visual twists to their wannabe movies, things like this movie come out--you can't directly tell how bad it is, because the visual trickstery feels original, even though the device has been explored already with a better story--even though the gaffes in the movies give the movie very different unintended interpretations. SPOILERS when you see that wifey does not get older, you start thinking: is she one too! when you see that the pens put in front of him are placed differently in every single one of the five different shots they appear in, is that another one of his...? When you tease the viewer by leaving a visual clue, you can't allow yourself to leave behind so many gaffes.
1/10
