 Again a very nice series from Netflix!

 Instantly hooked

 Destined to become a modern classic

 A great series. Good for Netflix!

 Don't know what people expect?

 Excellent Show - We Need a Season 2!!!

 Great acting, good fun, while also staying scary and mysterious throughout.

 Best thing on screen in decades

 Gravity + Fringe + Five Find-outers + Alien + Agatha Christie + ET + The X-Files

 They'd all be at home on their iPhones in 2018

 Great first season, second so so.

 A surprising breath of fresh air for Netflix - nostalgia blended with original premises.

 Duffer Brothers Killed It Again!

 Best sci-fi show

 Don't read, watch!

 Completely addictive

 Childhood

 Fantastic Sci-Fi/Paranormal Thriller Blending Retro Spielberg & Stephen King

 Very fun show and a bit more

 A great homage to 80's horror and adventure films ...

 Refreshingly great series

 Spielbergian Goodness

 Best 80's Era Show Ever

 Bravo Netflix.

 Scifi/Horror at its Very Best
