I tried so hard to like this movie.  I understand - it's a classic, and anyone who loves movies should swear by this film because it's this and that and the other and it can cure warts and remove cellulite and fix your car... An hour into it, my date and I were so lost that we turned it off.  The acting was great, of a caliber we don't see much of in modern movies, but the storyline just didn't sit with me.  I had no idea what was going on half the time (the legal aspects, for instance) because I don't have an intimate knowledge of the time period or location, and when I did understand what was happening (the affair), I wasn't sure why this movie had become classic.  I mean no offense to the people who love this movie.  I just wish I could have loved it, too.


                
First off, I'm going to say this once and make it very clear. If you liked "Casablanca" and though it was a work of "sheer brilliance" than that's fine. Hence the old saying "each to his own". If you didn't like it, then I agree with you. Now before you snobs critically abuse, hear me out. I saw nothing in it that was deserving of the title "epic". Now I am not one of those ignorami who hate movies made before 1970. Many of these live up to their name (Zulu, Singin' In The Rain, Ben-Hur). I found Casablanca to be boring overlong and poorly acted. While the work of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergmen may have been good for it's time it is insufficient compared to todays advanced standards. The settings are dull and rather unimaginative.
Sure, you "Cinematic Elite" may like it, but is "Casablanca" really the kind of movie that would appeal to the average person at their local cinema. I wanted to like the film (I really did), but I'm not going to pretend I liked it just because all of you fellow critics admired it. But that's my opinion, if you agree with me then please send a message. If you disagree, then enlighten me.


                
I heard, it was a good film that I have to see. So I watched the film - and I was disappointed. Okay, I didn't like such films very much, but this was one of the most boring films I've ever seen!!! It's a film with no thrilling moments and no interesting story. I waited and waited for a situation that wasn't easy to foresee, without luck. The happiest moment for me was the moment the film ended. Hey guys, this is a classic film, the only reason to watch it!


                
because it is a classic that doesn't have to mean that you still have to like it. If the film was made now it would surrily flop. Then they didn't show that much films in the cinema so everybody went to every movie that came out, an that is wy all older people saw it. they remember the "good old times".


                
Even though people think it is one of the best films out there, I just think the accents in it were terrible. The only two persons accents I could understand, was Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman as their main characters. I cant understand why I understood them better than the other characters because, the actors who did the fake thick Moroccan accents, were just so hard to listen to! I just had to skip to the ending where it was only just the characters Rick and Isla saying farewell to each other so, she was able to get away from the war. I would've liked to enjoy it but, unfortunately that wasn't the case with watching this movie. I'm disappointed that it didn't turn out to be what I expected it to be - one of the best movies in the world :(
2.5I think thats all i really need to say. Its OK, its obvious that almost all other reviews of this turd are nothing but hive-mind badtardation. A totally mediocre movie without much in the way of meaning or expression, mostly mediocrity.


                
Casablanca is the story of Rick (Humphey Bogart}, who owns a bar in world war II in Casablanca. Rick's best friend is a black guy who plays a piano named Sam. Nazis and people who are not Nazis come to the bar to drink and smoke cigarettes. Rick's old ex-flame Ilsa (Ingmar Bergman), goes into the bar. She is now married to a man (Peter Lorre).This film has classic dialogues like; "Play it again Sam", which Rick say to Sam when he's in the bar playing the piano. And "Here's looking at you kid", which rick says to Louie while they are walking. This classic film was directed by Michael Curtiz, who directed other movies to.Also recommended: "Citizen Kane", "Saving Private Ryan", "Schindler's List", "Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Grindhouse", "The Toxic Avenger", "CHUD", "Re- Animator", "Lifeforce", "Evil Dead 1 & 2", "Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)", "Night of the Living Dead (1968 and 1990)", "Day of the Dead (1985)", "Making Contact (a.k.a. Joey)", "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend", "Fist of the North Star (1986)", "Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night", "Heavy Metal", "Akira", "Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky", "Ichi The Killer", "Audition", "Visitor Q", "House of 1000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects", "The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)", "City of the Living Dead (a.k.a. Gates of Hell)", "House By the Cemetery", and "The Beyond".
I am flabbergasted that this totally boring load of rubbish could become such a major classic! Humphrey Bogart is obviously a great actor, but this movie almost put me to sleep! Every character in the movie either has a cigarette sticking out of his mouth or a silly accent. This film has absolutely no right to be considered a classic, nor should it ever be considered anyone's all time favorite movie!


                
Seriously helpalso why are they in africaI hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(Ah, gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
