 An investment

 Not an anime review, but movie review

 The most beautiful anime I've ever seen

 A wonderful miniseries that deserves more exposure

 One of the best animes I've ever seen.

 its really heartbreaking!!!

 This is going to be one big spoiler since I don't know how to put Kenshin in any other way

 Blue Velvet spiced into Shogun Assassin

 I am a loyal fan to Kenshin and the Samurai x series

 soundtrack rules as well...

 This anime deserves an all 10

 There can be no equal.

 this is...different

 KICK-@SS

 Greatest Anime Ever.

 Gut-wrenching in more ways than one

 Situated in a pre-tv series timeline, this four part OVA will leave you speechless.

 A very emotional and powerful masterpiece!

 Best Movie...EVER!

 Not a good way to break up

 Excellent

 Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal

 Rurouni Kenshin - Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuioku Hen - NO Spoilers

 Very rare - movie is better than the series

 Impossible to improve.
