 Great animation (as ever) but lacks a compelling story

 Good animation, boring story

 Too many short circuits for grown ups

 I was a little disappointed

 boring, boring, boring

 A Well-Compacted Bunch of Trash

 boring

 Cute robot, bad film

 Good movie, not great

 Incredibly Stupid

 Pixar knows how to preach clichés, but makes little effort to entertain.

 Contamination Alert!

 Great animation, weak story.

 Pics-r dumb-ees sill-ee...

 highly overrated and boring

 Hard work.
