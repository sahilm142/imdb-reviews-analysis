 Masterclass Cinema

 Sublime cinema - like Hithcock with the extremity of Oldboy and the sexual candour of Blue is the Warmest Colour.

 Just amazing

 Park Chan-wook crafts another masterpiece!

 Not Old Boy, but that's OK

 Tour De Force!

 Blue is the Warmest Color + Oldboy = The Handmaiden

 Classy South Korean Erotic Thriller Divided in Three Parts

 The Korean legend returns; more debauched than ever, but funnier too.

 A very refined and directed movie

 You gotta hand it to Park Chan-wook

 Cinema at its Finest and a Commentary

 Engaging and attractively packaged and delivered

 Beautiful imagery, disappointing content

 A beautiful movie spoiled by too many erotic scenes

 An exciting mystery

 Tedious, long winded, beautifully shot

 Outstanding masterpiece.

 Pornography and an Over-the-top Plot

 A beautiful erotic crime thriller

 Sex Still Sells

 Worth seeking out

 A lot of sex scenes not contributing to the main story

 Well-made, but I wanted something grittier

 Fetishization detracts from plot
