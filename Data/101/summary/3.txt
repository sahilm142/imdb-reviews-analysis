 Good Will Bluffing - An Adolescent Smugfest

 Snark Hunting

 An over-rated drama for popular culture

 Contrived and unrealistic

 Over-hyped Banal Trash

 I couldn't have cared less about Will Hunting

 Annoying self-aggrandizement

 good script hunting?

 A genius kid from the streets conquers Harvard..

 I do not understand this films greatness

 Great acting swimming against the current of a fairy story

 Sickly-sweet ickyness

 Extremely Overrated

 Bad Boy Hunting

 good God, good Will....
