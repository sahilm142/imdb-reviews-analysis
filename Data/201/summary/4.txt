 Mildly Disappointed

 Very underwhelming

 Somewhere, Spike Lee is mad. Right here, I'm disappointed.

 Slow, boring, and lacking in emotion

 Too much fuss for its own good

 Manipulative, Illogical, bigoted

 Typical Clint Eastwood 5/10

 The most annoying type of movie

 Does it deserve all the praise?

 I saw this movie the day after the Pope died (screen)

 Wooden-nickle Baby

 If you like emotional self-flagellation, you'll love this movie

 Stick to acting Clint...

 A Million Dollars Worth Of Disappointment

 Karate Kid with an 'issue'

 Okay, okay, it won lots of prizes

 A depressing experience

 Highly overrated

 Medical errors at end spoiled movie

 I can't figure out why people thought this was so good

 Cheap Manipulative Direction Blinds Audiences to Horrible Acting, Writing

 Awful

 Some good points, but very drawn out

 Let down by the script
