 Ostentatiously pretentious with a one-dimensional central character

 I flatter myself I know something about movies, but...

 Well made, but dull

 Not too great

 So-so, really

 A more restrained, less full-throated bull than I'd expected

 This movie doesn't belong in the Top-250

 Much respect for Scorsese, De Niro, and Pesci. Little respect for movie.

 If you like fight movies and Italians you'll like this graphic biography of LaMotta, and I emphasize "graphic".

 Disappointing - don't get me wrong please read why instead.

 Just doesn't hold the interest.

 Overrated...a few good scenes

 Although beautiful, Our Main Charectrer is so unlikeable, you can't have a connection.

 Sorry everybody but I found Raging Bull dead boring

 Raging in every way . . .

 Raging Bull is about Jake La Motta's life and how he dealt with his anger inside the ring and outside the ring and what it ended up costing him.
