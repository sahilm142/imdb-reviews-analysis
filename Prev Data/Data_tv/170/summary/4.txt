 The best TV show ever made by far

 Brilliant show! It's going to be timeless!

 Cringeworthy genius

 Funny, vis a vis, ergo, de facto humorous stuff

 I'm sad... and hooked

 Excellent.

 Brilliant!

 Simply a comedy classic

 The best sitcom so far

 A total paradox of a programme, but probably the best Brit-com since Fawlty Towers

 Breath of fresh air in television. (Please do another season!!!!!!!!)

 Everything that TV should be.
