Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films. Foreign films are usually thought to appeal to only a sophisticated and cultured audience, but Children of Heaven is best suited for all audiences. Forget that this film is set in a foreign land with an unfamiliar culture. Forget that the script is written in a language that you can't understand. These elements are only a small part of the story that will whisk you away and get you lost in the simplicity of the plot. Children of Heaven follows the story of Ali and Zahra and their conquest to find a lost pair of shoes. In an attempt to hide the lost shoes from their parents, the brother and sister duo decide to share one beat up pair of sneakers. This films gives an inside view of the life of a poor Iranian family and the innocence of young children. Children of Heaven opens your eyes to culture different from your own. A culture very much stereotyped because of its common appearance in American newsstands. Children of Heaven tells a story never broadcasted in the media. It can help to show the similarities and differences between American and Iranian culture. Our similarities are more than your local news lets on. We both share a class system which separates the rich from the poor. We both share the importance of family relationships and religion. We often forget that people all over the world endure our same trials and triumphs. Children of Heaven forces its audience to examine their own lives. As Americans we wonder how children with so little can be content? We wonder what it means to live simply. This film reminds us to be thankful and not value our material possessions. It also reminds us the importance of strong family relationships. Next time you contemplate viewing a foreign film think of all the benefits. Viewing foreign films exposes you to new and different cultures, languages, music and landscapes. It can contradict stereotypes and biases conjured up by news reports. You will become more respectful to those with values and morals that differ from your own. Foreign films encourage you to explore new places and create appreciations for the benefits that your own culture has to offer you. WARNING: Children of Heaven may cause a new outlook on life. You will leave this film a little happier and more appreciative. Now don't say I didn't warn you.
Majid Majidi's Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a fascinating and deeply moving piece. It is a children movie which will be equally enjoyed by adults, and that's simply because it will take any adult back to their childhood days, back to the days when they did something wrong and were afraid to confess to their parents. The film was made with great simplicity and soul, and its impact is perfectly made through the characters of Ali and Zahra, two amazing kids who can set an example to anyone. Majidi brilliantly captures the world of these young golden-hearted creatures. They are smart, intelligent, innocent, respectful and caring. It's quite impressive to see how little kids pay respect to their seniors, what moral values they have, and their tender care for their parents' economic status and daily struggle is particularly moving. More than anything, it is their own sibling relationship which tugs at the heartstrings. Majidi's portrayal of the neighbourhood, the school where the kids study, and their own home, is most lifelike and authentic. Without a doubt, the script is the film's main winner, but the casting is one of the film's biggest strengths. Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi are astonishing in their roles - charming, convincing, heartbreaking and totally relatable. You really feel for these kids and really want to settle their problems so that they can move on. This film is a true example of superb acting by child artists, and it shows how far they can go in their ability to explore the innocent spirit of childhood. Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a wonderful cinematic experience, which must not be missed by anyone. Just go and grab your seat, I assure it will keep you on the edge of it for one hour and a half and will be engraved in your heart long afterwards.


                
This is just one of the many excellent movies that came out of Iran in recent years. Again the story is simple but poignant. Again the amateur actors do a wonderful job in their role. This is truly a movie that's enjoyable from beginning to end.Out of 100, I gave it 89.


                
When I had heard that we were going to be watching an Iranian film in class, I was a bit apprehensive. I have experienced very little exposure to foreign films and was instantly put off by the subtitles. My trepidation was further reinforced when I was told to pay close attention to the pair of shoes in the beginning of the movie because they were a very integral part of the film. I couldn't imagine how something as trivial as a pair of shoes could keep me interested throughout the entire story. However, I am very happy to say that I was wrong in my preconceived notions. This film made me realize that the simple things in life truly are the most important.The characters that were chosen for this film were not real actors. This choice helped to make the film appear real and keep it from becoming sensationalized because of the actors. The sets that were chosen helped to contrast the poor area of Iran and the more modernized and wealthy area that Ali and his father visited in search of work. An interview that I came across that Ross Anthony from Hollywood Report Card gave to Majid Majidi, stated that the cameras used in the film were hidden, even from the actors. This allowed for a more natural feel as well as decreased the inexperienced actor's apprehensions.The surface theme of Children of Heaven is about Ali losing his younger sister, Zahra's, shoes and trying to make things right without the help of his parents. The family is extremely poor and Ali knows that his father is not in any position to buy another pair of shoes for Zahra. When looking further into this theme, I am amazed at the cultural differences in Middle Eastern and American lifestyles. I have no doubt that there are families in America facing extreme economic hardships that experience some of the sacrifices shown in this film. However, the United States is overall very materialistic and it is not often that we are exposed to families, especially children that are willing to make the sacrifices that the characters of this film made. Ali wanted to take direct responsibility for his sister and felt genuine remorse for the loss of her shoes. In most American films, the audience would be turned off by the main character, especially a boy, crying so often throughout the movie. In this case, Ali's love for his family is prevalent throughout the film and his strong emotions come across very heartfelt and sincere.In American films, the extremity of violence and other shock factors has become necessary in order to appeal to a desensitized audience. However, the simplicity of Children of Heaven had an ironically similar effect. In our society, we often lose sight of the little things in life and base our happiness around the cost and quantity of what we have. This film made me experience more emotions than many American films that I have seen. The importance of the Muslim's belief in the will of Allah impacted the way that the characters interacted and handled their disappointments. In American society, we tend to blame others for their misfortunes and expect them to be accountable for their own suffering. In contrast, Muslims believe that everything that they experience is what God has intended. In that way, suffering and misfortune take on very different meanings because despite your disadvantages, you are coming closer to God by following his will.Another difference in the cultural influences of this film is the importance of winning. In America, winning is everything and under no circumstances should you ever be content with losing. However, when Ali won the race he was completely disappointed that he had not finished third. Although the reason for his being upset is because he wanted to win the shoes for Zahra, for most Americans no circumstances would justify not wanting to come in first place. A large reason for this difference is again the importance of the will of God in the Muslim religion. I was extremely impressed with Children of Heaven and moved by the simplistic and powerful effect the film had on me. The idea that more is always better is proved wrong by this film and the impact that it has made on so many viewers. The extremely low cost of the film, the inexperienced actors, and the lack of technological advancements and images, gives the wrong impression about the quality of the film. In fact, the success of this film shows that the simple things in life are often more important.
I lived in Iran when I was younger that the children depicted here. It was also a long time ago (Truman was president). Nevertheless, this was very nostalgic for me.The plot is more than enough to carry this movie and entertain most adults and many pre-adolescents, but I wouldn't think anyone over 10 or under 30 would be riveted. Young Ali is like many a Hitchcock hero in that the unwanted circumstances he finds himself in are not his fault, but he doesn't really know that."Children" reveals things most Americans think they already know about Iran: Strong patriarchal society, strange mix of high tech and ancient coexisting comfortably, certainly not diverse the way we perceive it. There are some unintended revelations that are refreshing. Strong scholastic discipline among the middle classes, sibling bonding altruism that outstrips natural sibling rivalry, family values that are the equal of any anywhere, but, most beautiful to me, the greenery of the country. This last is not showcased, but all the more surprising because it's taken for granted. This is a beautiful land.This film should be mandatory viewing for all Department of State and Department of Defense employees and their bosses and their bosses' bosses.


                
Neo-realism was the school of cinema developed by the Italians just after World War II. From 1945 to approximately 1954, directors like De Sica, Rossellini and Zampa delivered  masterpieces like Open City, Paisan, To Live in Peace, Shoe Shine, The Bicycle Thief, Umberto D and Miracle in Milan. But the Italian (not the World) audiences got tired of seeing poverty and everyday problems and demanded something more sophisticated. Federico Fellini added imagination to the down-to-earth themes of Neo-realism and gave the world a new concept of cinema. Neo-realism, it was said, was proper to poor, not to wealthy cinematic industries. It this was son, Iranian Director Majid Majidi accepted the challenge, and has made Children of Heaven, the most moving and perfect piece of neo-realism that has been filmed outside of Italy.  The story is much like that of The Bicycle Thieves: it's a pair of shoes that are stolen. But Majidi has provided us with the most wonderful performances from children that the screen has ever seen. A great story, magnificent color and camera work,perfect actors both children and adult, and a firm direction that never misses an opportunity to engage and captivate the audience.  I have never seen a better motion picture from that part of the world.


                
I watched Three Iranian movies in as many days (The Day I Became A Woman, A Moment of Innocence and then, Children of Heaven) and now I want to locate a bad Iranian film. I got all these three above movies from the Los Angeles Public Library, and I've decided to now finish watching all the Iranian movies they have (Including the ones without any subtitle) and try to find a bad movie among them.I loved this movie, mainly because this narrative is very succinct. ***SPOILER BEGINS***** For example, I do not know how many of the viewers noticed the father carrying two pairs of new shoes at one point of time! ***SPOILER ENDS*** It is also a bit unpredictable. Any formula movie, by default, must make the central character win every contest, whereas an art house movie must make him/her lose and end with despair. Not quite this movie!This movie reminded me of Umberto D., a masterpiece by the "Boss of All Bosses", Vittorio De Sica.It deserves a 10, but for a couple of scenes that were not fully convincing: One involving a dog, and another that involves an accident.


                
it's the first time i got to see an Arabic film. before watching, i talked to myself "just try and have an experience of new style. forget about the crazy Arabic. anyway at least a break from Hollywood"however, when i started i found myself totally absorbed into this movie, which is so plain and pure about a little boy and his sister, who had to go through with only one pair of schooling shoes. it's just simply an episode of childhood life, but through Majidi's direction, it like happened yesterdaylooked through other comments at this site, i quite agree that some feeling are common among all human beings, whatever their color, language or belief. it just lays there, so quietly that we could even ignored its existence. it can't be simply built by money. Hollywood can make some visually fantastic movies, but for heart-touching ones i'd rather say goodbye to Hollywood temporarily two leads share a pair of shoes, while it's a bicycle that in another Chinese movie called Beijing Bicycle. after seeing this, i think it's better than Beijing Bicycle. for one thing, it sounds more fictional for two boys sharing a bicycle for totally different purpose; for the other i don't think the latter copes well the love inside, which appears somehow abrupt for me. while in Majidi's film, Ali and Zahra make the story just like happen around yourself. you're part of Ali run through the race and come back with disappointment. i can see no artificial in their performance, just so naturally by the way, who's the guy composed the sound track? i find it very beautify and goes pretty well with the movie. someday i'm gonna find it for myselfPS:sometimes just feel it necessary to write something, maybe just help me to remember a good movie when i'm old?


                
When I repeatedly passed this film at the local library, I completely ignored it because it looked rather dull and I must admit I had a prejudice against Iranian films. I incorrectly assumed that the movie would somehow be anti-Western or full of Islamic anger. Boy, I am VERY glad I was proved wrong.When I say "dull" above, I am referring to the incredibly simple and mundane plot--the movie is ACTUALLY far from dull. A boy loses his sister's shoes after he picks them up from the shoe repair shop and the rest of the movie consists of him and his sister trying to hide this from their parents. So, HOW does this merit a 9? Well, actually it came pretty close to a 10 (for that see the follow-up film The Color of Paradise)--it was that good. This is thanks to excellent acting by real people and a humanity about the film that crosses all cultures. Despite so many differences between the people of Iran and the United States, this film gave me a ray of hope due to characters' decency and sense of values. This film reminds me very much of the simple yet wonderful films by DeSica, such as Umberto D., The Miracle in Milan and Two Women.


                
Its a short story like Vannadhasan's in Tamil. It's poetic in nature. The characters are all good people. Its a children movie. There are always arguments about showing 'what people are' and 'what people could be' in movies.  For this story there is no need to show people as they are. That would shadow the main point of the story-Love inspite of one's struggles. So far I have seen only this Iranian movie. But its wonderful. The director's view is exactly coinciding with a child's view. 'Bubbles', 'sneakers in the rain','girl looking at all shoes in the prayer', 'class room dialogue for football match between students' and 'giving the new pen gift to the sister' are typical of children. The film has much more. The 'poverty' is not stressed much. But that is also the reason for viewers enjoying the movie instead of feeling the social contrastness. As I see from a country like India I felt very closer to the Iranian people because their life style portrayed in this movie looks familiar and gave me the feeling that people are same everywhere. In India for the past decade since the Babri Majid demolition there has been ill opinions about the life style of Muslims (closed, religiously fanatic ,inhumane and possesive) spread by the fascist movements like RSS and BJP. Movies like these may help ordinary film goers in some way.


                
In a poor Tehran neighborhood, Ali picks up a pair of shoes for his sister Zahra. He loses them while in a store buying potatoes. His father is a simple laborer and his mother is bedridden. He is desperate to hide the mistake from his father and decides to share his sneakers with his sister. The shoes may be small but the stakes do not get much higher. That is the universal truth and that is the greatness of this movie. The family has so little that those shoes mean everything. The kids are terrific. One can really feel their fear and embarrassment. These are big time performances and they have great humanity. The tension in that race does not get much higher. It is all about the stakes and that small prize has such big stakes. There is a parallel with the Bicycle Thieves and I dare say that this approaches that cinematic icon. This was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar but lost to Life Is Beautiful.


                
Oh man...this is a film that the whole world needs to see. I confess I am guilty of taking 20 years after its release to sit down and watch it (though I recall when it was released critics said how great it was but, in the passage of time, I guess I just forgot to see it). Nevertheless, I am very happy that, finally, I did. It is gripping in the most charming of ways. The children are wonderful; the story so real (at least for those of us from a poor family background) and the narrative's progress utterly convincing.Other contributors here have expressed the meaning of this film in far more eloquent and comprehensive ways than I ever could so, I will not go down the road of explaining the plot or its ramifications. What I will say though, which was also mentioned by other posters here, is that this film absolutely needs to be on IMDb's 'Top 250' list. It is everything we want from a film. If only 99% of the world's film makers did but know that.


                
Older brother makes a mistake carrying out his duties that in effect involves the sharing of shoes with his little sister. The idea that a pair of shoes, simple shoes, can change a families life on levels of loss and aspiration are indelibly portrayed in this film. The children take it upon themselves to carry the burden to the extent of hiding their shared secret from parents. How this evolves through the story is nothing short of minimalist exposition with superb attention to detail. Acting is beyond anything Hollywood could imagine, story beyond what many can relate to. At the same time, the story sucks you in and takes you to a place you forgot. Memorable, heartfelt and involving ideas lost in western materialism. Watch it and feel your childhood. Certainly not a gender study, this film is about the personal perception of characters and their goals. Truly film-making at it's finer moments. Almost perfect. Nothing is such, so nine of ten, well deserved.


                
Children of Heaven is film that I implore everyone to see. The director and writer Majid Majidi has set a high standard for film makers everywhere. This films gives unique insight into the eventful, yet ordinary life of two young Muslim siblings, Zohre and her older brother Ali. When Ali loses his sister's shoes the duo decide to share Ali's in fear that his poverty ridden family will become upset. Ali then forms a plan to fix his mistake in secrecy. On his journey there are genuine scenes of action packed excitement, and moments of heartwarming love from people that hold little to their name. One thing I thoroughly enjoyed about this film was that the director did an excellent job of showing the Muslim culture in a light not often seen by the western culture. The intimacy of the characters and families does a great deal in educating viewers of a culture other than their own. This film puts Hollywood film making to shame, and truly shows that special effects are not necessary in making a film that is exciting and eventful. The genius that is Majid Majidi will be known and his film will be seen by generations to come.


                
Ali is sent to pick up his sister's shoes from a repair shop and when he puts them down while at a produce stand, a garbage man picks them up and throws them away. The boy frantically searches for the shoes with no luck, and so he asks his sibling, Zahra, not to tell their parent's because they are very poor, even being several months behind in their rent. The kids devise a scheme to share Ali's pair of Converse, with the two alternating school classes between mornings and afternoons. He is late because of the trade off in an alley and his principal warns him to be on time. Ali's father, desperate for money, takes his son along with gardening tools to a wealthy neighborhood, looking for work. They find a mansion and the owner's grandson plays with Ali as his father landscapes. On their way home, they fall off their bike and are slightly injured.Ali hears of a race with one of the prizes being a new pair of sneakers, so he decides to run in order to win the footwear for his sister. The ending is charming and so are the the two kids who play the brother and sister. Children of Heaven is proof that a big budget is not needed to make a great film.


                
Relationship between brother and sister portrayed like a Da Vinci painting. This movie is a piece of gem and I recommend it to everybody who love a story about relationships and hardships. The kids are perfect in their respective roles and the movie itself is as close to reality as it can be. Human innocence is perfectly shown through the children by artist of an director. Hats off to Majid Majidi for writing it and then directing it to perfection. The movie shows how simple things in life can change us as human beings and how a desire the grows from the depths of a pure heart can change us as an individual.I recommend this movie to those who love a story that reflects life as it is.


                
Until a fortnight ago I'd never seen an Iranian film and assumed any film from their would just be religious or political propaganda... perhaps there are films like that but having just watched this film and "Offside" it is clear that they also make fantastic character based films that are a delight to watch.On the face of it a film about a poor boy losing his sister's only pair of shoes doesn't sound the basis for a film that is both interesting and a joy to watch but it works. With his mother too ill to work and his father in a low paid job young Ali promises his sister Zahra that he will get her shoes back if she doesn't tell their parents about the loss. When he fails to find them he offers to share his own footwear; an old pair of trainers. This means that as soon as her school is over Zahra must run through the narrow back streets to get the shoes to Ali so he can go to his school, even though he runs he is slightly late each day and is getting in trouble. Director Majid Majidi did a great job getting such natural performances from his two stars, both of whom were young children. It is surprising that the children didn't go on to star in further films as they were both a joy to watch and made the viewer really care for their plight. The film might sound a bit boring and depressing but it isn't, there are a few sad scenes but for the most part it is a film that had me smiling from start to finish, I'll have to look out for more films from Iran.
Innocence and purity are the words that come to your mind after you have watched this movie. I got this movie from my local DVD library(God knows how they had such a masterpiece) and just to bide my time stared watching this movie. But what started as an innocuous plot finally turned out to be one of best movies I have ever watched. The story evolves around the brother and sister Ali and Zara.A bolt of bad luck causes Ali to loose Zaara's shoes, therefore the kids come up with a plan to share the only pair of sneakers that they have. What follows is then a heart warming tale of brother and sister trying there best to cope up with the situations that crop up and in the mean time keeping there secret. The plot of the movie is quite simple but is full of beautiful moments. These moments become more beautiful because of the great acting by the lead pair of brother and sister. Both the children have done extremely good acting and this itself is a tribute to the director of this movie. This movie is like a new born child, as you go along the movie you start sharing there emotions, feeling bad for there misfortune and hoping internally that everything turns out fine with them. The movie is full of positive energy and watching this movie leaves u with a hopeful and enthusiastic state of mind and heart. One other good aspect of this movie is the way in which it showcases Iran's culture. It shows quite boldly that Iran and other Arab countries are not just about Mullahs and hardliners and the people there are no different from the rest of the world. They also essentially share the same spirit of humanity. Overall a great movie and must watch for any avid cinema follower.


                
Children of Heaven is a simple movie, but creative in its imagery and symbolism. The story is about a boy who loses his sister's shoes and his fierce determination to get his sister a replacement pair. The most poignant scene that illustrates the boy's desire to help his sister and bring her comfort is shown in the marathon race around the lake in a modern downtown city in Iran.Ali enters a marathon race to win third prize, which is a new pair of sneakers, for his sister, Zahra. The race begins and Ali is in the middle of a pack of boys, all around his age. A few times, Ali trips and falls to the ground, causing him to fall behind the other boys in the race, losing his place. Every time he falls down, he picks himself back up with a look of fierce determination on his face and charges back into the race. He is breathing heavily and fatigue begins to show on his face, but he only thinks of his sister and his promise to get her a new pair of shoes. This show of fierce family loyalty is so moving, especially from one so young.All around him there are birds chirping and trees moving past him, with a large lake behind Ali in every take. This reference to a garden, water, and Ali's promise are striking allusions to the Islamic religion on which this movie is based. The lake is an Islamic symbol for purification, alms, and the Will of God. Water is an unstoppable force that cannot be avoided just as God is an unstoppable force that is always affecting man's everyday lives. The trees and the sound of the birds singing is another allusion to God through nature. This nature is a representation of the Garden of Eden from which all of mankind derived and will one day re-enter.This movie ties together to Islamic tradition of family helping one another in times of need and the will and power of God in their everyday lives. This is definitely a movie worth seeing if you love simple and beautiful imagery, straightforward story line, and the determination of man to overcome adversity.


                
This film was something very different for me to view. Coming from an American movie watcher's point of view this movie had a very stark contrast to the usual films that I would see at movie theaters. This wasn't a bad thing it made the film that much more interesting because of the way the story was portrayed.The basic plot revolves around a pair of shoes. These are the shoes of Zahra the sister of, and one of the main characters, Ali. After Ali has these shoes repaired he ends up losing them because a trash collector, thinking that they were garbage, picks them up. Throughout the movie Ali attempts to track down the shoes while having to share his shoes with Zahra. Their father cannot afford new shoes because they live in poverty. It is very interesting to see what happens while searching for the shoes.This plot may seem kind of boring, but it the film took this seemingly boring story and actually made it very interesting, even for an American Audience base. Some of this was due in part to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of the shoes. There was quite a bit of symbolism throughout the entire film. The idea that anytime water is flowing, or you see water, signifies the Will of God or just God himself comes to mind in the context of the Muslim faith. The Muslim faith believes that water symbolizes God and the Will of God. The way the film shoots the water scenes show that it is the will of God to not regain the shoes and in the end to accept that they have been lost. No matter how the children attempt to fight this it keeps coming back to them in new forms. Ali signifies rising up against injustice and even he, the one who will take a stand against oppression, cannot fight the Will of God.The actors portrayed the roles very well. Even being children, without much acting experience, you believe the portrayal. Also the way in which the film was edited made it seem a bit slower than American films. As well as the camera work and lighting, the film had a feeling of poverty and being in the busy city while the characters sometimes felt out of place.In the end Children of Heaven is a film which is something that most Americans may not understand, unless given some background. That set aside it is a very good movie. Without some cultural knowledge people may miss some of the symbolism, but the story will still come through to the people who aren't as cultured. The film portrays the struggles of poverty and everyday city life in Iran and puts the world in context. A pair of shoes is more important to these children than being to school on time, looking fashionable or even winning. Something that Americans would find to be trash is something that is cherished and loved by these children.
The simple story of a family's struggles with poverty is told through the eyes of children. A boy misplaces the worn out shoes of his little sister, and thus is forced to share his own pair of sneakers with her, taking turns attending school. Afraid to tell their parents, the siblings continue the deception for days.The father is hard working, yet poorly paid, while the mother appears repeatedly disabled by a slip disc condition. It is heart breaking to hear the parents discuss their money problems, mainly the unpaid rent and other bills. When the wife suggests an operation to put an end to her constant back pains, the husband insists that the dangers of permanent damage would be too risky, better to put up with occasional attacks. The viewer can recognize the true issue of money.There are few, but very sincere expressions of love. To see the boy's face light up when his father praises his abilities is beautiful. When the mother expresses how proud she is of the children for helping her at home, the little ones beam with happiness. There are also examples of charity and generosity, neighborly gestures of kindness, that are rare in most cultures, especially in lands of plenty. The final minutes of the film are both deeply touching and hopeful. The scene ends in the little boy's total hopelessness, while the viewer knows about the eminent ray of joy to enter the children's life.For people of other cultural background it is very pleasant to see how children here are compelled to unquestioned obedience towards authority figures, asking permission to speak by raising their finger, never daring to interrupt or be disrespectful. School work is seen as an honor, and talent as a gift. Despite obvious economic disadvantages, the absence of rebellious youth in this culturally different society is unknown to Westerners, and it is certainly refreshing. Winning many International Awards, "Children Of Heaven" was also the first ever entry from Iran to be nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar. Pure and innocent, a true example of the triumph of the human spirit. I can highly recommend this film, especially to children unaccustomed to extreme poverty. Even without the ability to keep up with fast paced subtitles, one can appreciate the magic of this cinema gem!


                
This is a simple but an excellent movie. Initially I thought just another of those "showing poor" style movie started. But as things go ahead, it was different. Ali lost his sister Zahra's shoes and the movie was a struggle to show that Ali wants to get back those shoes somehow.It was just not a struggle to get back shoes, but get back on our true life. If you love simplicity and want to get back on fundamentals of life, this is the movie.During this time I have seen a series of Iranian movies and quite impressed with the quality of the movies; I had no idea about the life of common people in Iran, the simplicity in their thoughts and the type of music, food, arts, beauty they like. These movies are really educating to me.


                
This was a perfect 10 but I was just a bit disappointed with the ending of the movie.


                
Kudos to the director who marvelously used the spell bound charisma of his direction into he characters of the well written script and did justice to the writer as well. Ali and his sister played seriously award winning role. the emotions are heart touching and worth watching movie. And to all directors and script writers '' heavens of children'' would always remains a challenge and inspiration as well.
When reading up about the Iran New Wave (INW) one of the first titles I found out about was Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven. Intrigued by the details,I was disappointed in being unable to track a good print of the movie down. Checking on what films were about to go from Netflix UK,I was thrilled to find an INW film,that I hoped would be heavenly viewing.The plot:Going to get shopping for his family,Ali puts the new shoes his dad ordered for his sister Zahra on the side for a minute.Coming back with a shopping bag,Ali finds that the shoes have been taken. Thinking of the money issues facing the family,Ali tries to keep things hidden. Secretly talking to Zahra,the siblings make a deal of each taking it in turns to wear Ali's old sneakers between classes. Believing that this is the new path they must walk,Ali is thrilled to learn of a contest that might let him make things up to Zahra.View on the film:Keeping the camera at Ali and Zahra's level,writer/director Majid Majidi & cinematographer Parviz Malekzaade masterfully cut rustic INW Neo-Realism with the dramatic heft of the Sports Drama. Keeping costs as low as possible by shooting on location, Majidi gives the side streets of Tehran an earthy atmosphere brushed with lingering shots breathing in the daily life of the family and small tracking shots getting beneath the busy streets of the town. Stepping into the "sports movie" Majidi balances the earthy setting with elegant slow motion that brings out the loud gasps from Ali in his desire to make up for his mistake.Lacing a bond between brother and sister,the screenplay by Majidi gives an extraordinary richness in the daily lives of the family,as Majidi brings to light the smallest moments between the family,from Zahra and Ali writing less than secret notes to each other,to Ali having to run out in the rain to put his torn sneakers in the family shoe area. Joining Ali in putting running shoes on, Majidi wonderfully skips over Sport movie clichés by keeping Ali's contest firmly linked to the family troubles that give the film a touchingly poetic final note. Criss-crossing school runs under the noses of their mum and dad, Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi give magnificent performances as Ali and Zahra,thanks to Seddiqi giving Zahra a taut sharpness, whilst Seddiqi gives Ali a nose to the grindstone determination to find some heavenly footwear.
