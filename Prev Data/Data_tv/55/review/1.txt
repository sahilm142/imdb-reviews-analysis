It is no surprise, that Fawlty Towers resonated with many, considering how popular "cringe comedy" is.This only is the case though, if your mirror neurons, responsible for empathy, are close to /dead/. Otherwise it will be a hellish nightmare that is literally physically painful to watch.On top of that, the whole hotel depicted in it, is a complete chaos of an utterly unbearable level.Which might excite the dull and tedious and stuffy and boring and desperately /desperately/ dull among the population.But if your life already had quite enough "excitement" (read: daymares), then I must strongly suggest you stay far *far* away from this programme.
