 You surely didn't expect this (Good & Bad)

 Very very disappointing

 an annoying B movie only interesting for Indian people

 A below average fare at best.

 PK - Brilliant, if not watched Oh My God

 Worst Raju Hirani / Amir Khan Movie Ever

 Hippocratic cocky try that makes fool of itself

 OMG was much better!

 Poor storyline, very predictable and has a lot of flaws

 not good at all!!!!

 pk could not be a waste of time..

 Seriously flawed and stupid trash

 Lower than expected

 Does not belong on top 250 list

 Pathetic excuse for movie
