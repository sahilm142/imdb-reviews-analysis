 Over-rated western

 Eastwood's Spacey, Vacant Western Makes Shockingly Slow Progress

 Should have been called "Revenge of the Whores"

 I Was a Friend of John Ford, and You, Sir, Are No John Ford

 Nope, I won't forgive this movie

 Already Forgotten

 Eastwood tries, and fails, to be politically correct - it was better when he wasn't trying.

 Overlong revisionist western

 Why I'm not a fan of westerns

 Did Pa used to kill folks?

 A misguided career achievement award

 Overrated
