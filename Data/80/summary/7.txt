 A Documentary More Than Anything Else

 Begging

 Remarkable suspense and story-telling

 Mediocre movie

 no top

 Shines all the brighter for its age

 Lorre's best performance

 Historically Interesting

 Spoilers follow ...

 A dated film, well worth watching

 M for Mörder?

 Germany's Best film? I think not, but then again this is my opinion

 A very important film in the history of cinema

 Worth a look, 75yrs on ...

 Pretty Good Movie

 a good movie about Serial Killer

 "And then a voice screams!"

 A delightful museum piece
