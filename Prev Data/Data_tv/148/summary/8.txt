 Medieval kingdoms, big swords, frenzied warriors, gore, nude, sex, intrigue, betrayal, demons, a quest for vengeance, and an ending that was screaming for a sequel

 Great but flawed anime

 One of the best action based series, complex story and brutal action

 A story which pulls you in, then proceeds to make a fool of you!

 Liked it? Good, read the manga.

 Berserk : The Dark Saga
