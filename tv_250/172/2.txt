My wife was reading the book, Brideshead Revisited, for her book club and wanted to simultaneously watch the Jeremy Irons television mini- series. Having seen the 2008 movie, we were both interested based on the previously seen movie and our generally positive opinion of the work of Jeremy Irons. While my wife's opinion is not as negative as mine, I can say that this is the most boring program through which I have sat one-third of the full length. I could not make it any further. It seemed as if a quarter of the story was told in narrative instead of acted out. In addition to the boredom, the introductory music for each episode was terrible.


                
This adaptation follows the book closely in that it contains reams of drivel and dross.Charles Ryder, a dull, unimpressive, stiff, uninteresting, pedantic, small minded nobody is for some unknown reason feted and seized upon by a group of far more interesting characters. Why would they even bother with this little man? His dullness is faithfully transferred to the screen where Jeremy Irons performs in an equally insipid role which leaves the audience yawning for less.The only redeeming feature is the appearance of Ryder's father and Blanche who steal each scene they are in (admitedly not hard when those scenes involve Irons acting like a piece of cardboard) and leave us wanting more.


                
This is a very boring drama. It is just people talking all the time, without anything happening. It doesn't help that, with the exception of Jeremy Irons most of the acting is pretty iffy.There is far to much naval-gazing going on here, and though this is also a fault of the book as well, the endless voiceovers make it even more pronounced here.
