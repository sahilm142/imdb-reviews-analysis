 Well made, very grave and somewhat dull

 Judging "Judgment at Nuremberg"

 Absorbing but Uneven

 "Once more it is being done for love of country"

 Very heavy, but a must-see

 Emotionalizing for an audience of 1961

 Important movie with historical value

 Great dialog, but unconvincing characters

 One can't hate this movie, but

 Gripping

 7 out of 10

 The legacy of war

 Judging the 4 judges of Nazi era. Great courtroom drama about the Nazi Germany and moral code & responsibilities of domestic and world powers!
