 James Dean buys a pocket calculator.

 Quite good, except for a bogus ending

 Manipulative but well done.

 An enjoyable and moving film, despite the fumbles of Affleck.

 Good Will Hunting

 Promising screenwriting debut but an overrated movie.

 Good film, but predictable. Driver shines.

 Absolutely ingenious

 Good Movie, But Overhyped

 Well made and well acted, but ultimately not my cup of tea.

 Watch it for Williams turn as the mentor.

 Robin Williams is excellent and this film will make you tear up

 A great college movie.

 Before Jason Bourne.

 Arrogant genius learns facts about life

 Damon's career defining performance

 would recommend

 Pretty good film, but I wouldn't watch it again

 Predictable plot lets down an otherwise great film

 Nice casual film

 A Touching, Inspiring & Emotionally Dense Drama Steered By Stellar Performances From Robin Williams & Matt Damon

 Same old

 Better late than never.

 Better than Good

 Van Sant is the real star
