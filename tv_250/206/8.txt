Season 7 was pretty ambitious, there's a lot of moving parts going on, and the series is already a bit obtuse so you can be forgiven if you feel lost sometimes. Even so, you'll always find joy in the animation, the witty repartee, the many cultural references, etc. Episode 7 is a special R-rated treat, so be sure catch that if you tend to skip around.
