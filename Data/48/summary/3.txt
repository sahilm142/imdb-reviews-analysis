 Worst "historical" film ever

 Worst "historical" movie ever

 Ridley Scott's artificial epic isn't very impressive

 Rambo of Rome

 Lethal Weapon without car chase

 White Elephant

 Too many errors and an actor made out of wood

 Eh

 Uneven and Pretentious

 Great Cast but way too graphic.

 This got an Oscar?

 History or entertainment?

 Epically overrated - even the music

 Totally Overrated

 worth another look

 Spoiler but read it anyway. You'll be glad you did.

 Very Disappointing

 Highly Overrated Popcorn Movie about Ancient Americanized Rome

 One of the most overrated films of the decade....

 This is vexing...I am vexed.

 Total disappointment

 All appearance, no substance

 Lousy script saved by great pictures & actors

 How did people make the mistake of calling this a good movie?

 Blown opportunity
