 How An Action Movie Should Be Made

 Unstoppable

 Die Hard

 Pure Schmaltz, But Very Entertaining

 A humanized action hero.

 Hard to beat

 Yippy-Kay-Yay Motherf*cker

 Good classic 80s action movie!

 great movie from 80's!

 The first and best film of the series.

 I honestly don't see what the big deal is.

 A really good time

 If this is their idea of Christmas, I gotta be here for New Year's

 My brief review of the film

 Die Hard for Die Hard Fans.

 Good

 Classic one-liner action

 Classic dumb action that defined a genre

 Decent action flick

 Solid Action. Entertaining

 Don't Mess With John McLain

 The definition of an action movie

 Influential but flawed

 If you like Action-Adventure, It's worth seeing at least once.

 Good fun, Alan Rickman steals the show
