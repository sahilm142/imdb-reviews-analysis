 A funny thing happened to me on the way to the Grand Budapest Hotel

 The Plot Simply Doesn't Gel

 Another Original and Weird Movie by Wes Anderson

 Dazzling Visuals To The Rescue

 Lunacy, witty and pure fantasy!

 grand old time

 I suppose you'd call that a draw

 Sachertorte and Strychnine

 Frivolous and visually astounding, fun and funny and still restrained

 Fiennes at his finest

 The Divine Picture of Our Time

 Great Characters, very enjoyable, some cast

 Elaborate, Funny.

 Artfully done; in a whimsical, surreal style

 The Grand Budapest Hotel owned by Ralph Fiennes

 Visual Perfection

 An immaculate cake with a hollow centre

 As a non Wes Anderson fan, I did find this pleasant and the cast does an amazing job

 Engaging Fantasy

 Anderson is at the middle of point of his life, considering the uncertainty of the world

 The Expendables of indie movies. I feel like Wes Anderson just jerked off on my eyeballs.

 Less Wes?

 An oddball comedy inside a picturesque world

 Review - The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)

 Hardly a comedy, a little boring, but brilliantly made
