 A cathartic viewing experience

 When film was an art form

 One of Master's Most Optimistic, Profound, And Warmest Films.

 Film as an art form

 One of Bergman's greatest achievements

 First Bergman

 Stunning Bergman Masterpiece -- Maybe His Best?

 The only reality

 Better late than never; tragicomedy ending with hope

 One of the very, very best

 A gem among the history of movies

 Excellent Movie from the Master

 Sokrates said it, and a certain Ingmar Bergman too

 Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES Stunning on DVD

 A magnificent film

 One of the most beautiful films

 An almost mythical-style film

 One of the best films ever made!!!

 WILD STRAWBERRIES (Ingmar Bergman, 1957) ****

 my favorite film

 Flawless

 One of the Great Films of All Time

 Wonderful.

 A beautiful, moving masterpiece - Bergman's best

 Why bother getting up in the morning?
