 A cold, heartless, horror-movie treatment of one of the great epic stories of our time.

 Top 250?? Criminally over-rated.

 Not sure why so many loved this movie.

 It's a good kids movie.

 Every cliché in the book.

 They're in trouble, they're out of trouble...

 After an hour and a half I though 3 hours had passed

 Oops, Sorry Mr. Tolkien

 Did Peter Jackson READ the books?!?

 One word missing from Jackson's vocabulary: Subtle

 In A Word - Disappointing.

 Like watching paint dry

 Tolkiens world revisited?

 No point!

 I got a sore but at the theatre Movie...

 Overrated

 Repetitive and overrated

 over-rated

 I haven't been this angry since Boys and Girls

 An example of the effect that hype has on society.

 Long, boring, and childish

 So its about a bad ring they want to through in a volcano

 Snoozer

 A very tiresome nerd flick, that does not appeal to everyone. Bad movie!

 Overrated
