 Life's Lessons in one Movie...

 A beautiful fable for now and the future

 The zen of Forrest Gump.

 In my opinion, no film has touched me more than this one.....

 Let's see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump

 Purity and innocence retained

 why such a low rating???

 Tom Hanks delivers an astounding performance as Forrest Gump.

 Forrest Gump is a movie masterpiece that won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire

 Contemporary classic: one of my all-time faves

 Quite possibly the best movie ever made.

 One of the best films of the 90's

 Tom Hanks' best performance
