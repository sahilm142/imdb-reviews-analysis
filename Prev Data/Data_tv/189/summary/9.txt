 Fantastic and surprising in the good sense, despite my initial doubts as a Morse's fan

 The difficult first of the 'real' series is an amazing success

 Charming drama

 Endeavour stands on its own, even if you've never seen Thaw's Morse

 Stellar TV

 The very best of PBS

 A more than worthy, and almost as good, prequel series to Inspector Morse

 Outstanding, intelligent and emotive

 Enjoy, even if you can't turn back the clock.

 Surprisingly meaty and captivating British crime series

 A prequel that surpasses the original

 Some unfair reviews around here, I feel

 Echoes of the nostalgic past

 60s Ambience, Elegance

 Excellent.

 Interesting aside

 Incredible storytelling

 Cast well and you have a success

 10 but for the smoking.
