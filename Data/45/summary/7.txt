 Rear Window starts slow but is rewarding in the end.

 Surprisingly captivating

 A wheelchair man spies his neighbors

 Impressive Movie

 Looking Through the Rear Window

 Rear Window Review

 Peeping Tom and a Bombshell Blonde

 Jeff be peeping while you sleeping

 Claustrophobic And Beautiful

 Jimmy Stewart finally trusts everyone... just kidding!

 Brilliant, Voyeuristic, Minimalistic, Darkly Humorous Murder Thriller

 A classic of suspense and acting

 Precursor to "Dekalog 6" and "Cache"

 Hitchcock is a true genius, The whole Film is in one location a rare thing.

 Intriguing but Quite Disappointing

 Not quite Hitchcock

 Something different

 Stagecraft

 Jeff's being paranoid...

 Highly over-rated
