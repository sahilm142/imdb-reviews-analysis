 Real American Beauty - an exceptional movie

 Justice done.

 Beautiful Film, Even Better Than The Book

 Sneaks Up On You

 Captured his essence

 One of the best movies I've ever seen

 Real Life, Love

 An epic adventure! A masterpiece of a film!

 Exceptional in every possible way

 This movie makes you think of your life

 The best movie in a long, long time.

 Must see by one and all

 An emotionally wrenching story of the unforgiving lesson of nature

 Shocked

 where are all its Oscars?

 I felt this movie

 Society - you ugly breed

 The most wonderful and powerful movie ever seen

 This movie made me believe that anything is possible...

 Into The Wild

 A splendid example of film-making

 Inspirational

 Breathing air into Krakauer's pages!

 A rare pearl: when the word fails to translate emotion

 Thank You Mr. Penn for exposing my world to such beauty and honesty
