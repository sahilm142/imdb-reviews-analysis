Yes, this may be a milestone in (comedy) film making. And yes, maybe this movie was indeed perceived as funny when it came out. But looking at it now, it seems rather dull, predictive, and -- well -- not funny. After having watched it, I am not sure anymore whether it even made me smile anywhere at all. But I am positive I never had to 'laugh out loud' as some other reviewers remark.And it definitely does not represent a critical comment on war. The Civil War only serves as a background and an excuse for the 'adventure'. If you want a truly critical statement from that period, I'd recommend 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1930) instead.However, if you are not expecting a hilarious or brilliant comedy, you might still enjoy watching the movie. But you have been warned.


                
I was kind of disappointed by this movie. After watching a silent comedy in my History of American Cinema class I was looking forward to viewing this for homework. I felt like I couldn't get into this movie; being silent you really have to pay attention and I just couldn't seem to grasp what was going on. I came away from this without knowing a whole lot about the plot. While watching I had to continually rewind and re-watch. I don't think that this is by any means a bad movie, I am for one inexperienced in watching silent films and though I had a hard time with the storyline this movie had that classic, back to basic kind of comedy that had me laughing all the way through. All and all a great film for its time, I just wish I could of been a better viewer of it
