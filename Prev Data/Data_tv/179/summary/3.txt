 Totally unrealistic. An average heist show at best

 Overwhelmingly frustrating

 What a mess!!!!

 Good idea, bad development

 What!?!

 Avoid if you have high standards

 Scratch Action and Mystery - just put Crime and Romance

 Worse than the original.....

 it sucks

 fakey, cheesy, boring...8.8? wtf!?

 Interesting premise, but descends into flawed plot and acting

 An overrated series

 Hatewatched this....

 Fun, but very unrealistic **CONTAINS SPOLERS**

 Disney Version of Heat

 What a mess

 Enjoy mindless afternoon soap operas? This series is for you!

 Mediocre...

 Just a big robbery...

 A festival of clichés

 Terrible "Inside man" copycat

 I love Homeland, Prison Break.. this could have been a masterpiece!

 Did you really like it?

 Disappointed - show goes massively downhill

 Where are the twist and turns? Where are the mind games?
