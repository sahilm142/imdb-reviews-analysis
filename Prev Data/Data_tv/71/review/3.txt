I loved the show. I think it was brilliant. I laughed out loud for many seasons. But the new season 9 is very boring. I had high hopes for it but I am very disappointed. There is no doubt that Larry David is a comic genius and one of the greatest comedy writers of all times. But he should have moved on to a new concept. He is just annoying in this new season and not funny at all. The stories are stale and very unimaginative. Not that I could do any better. But I know he could. Not surprised the popularity for the show has tanked.


                
I don't know how to rate this show. I enjoy watching clips of it but getting though an entire episode is exhausting. So maybe the problem with this show is that the situations are funny in isolation or in concept and work as 1-2 minute bits (eg: cutting off a doll's hair, not honoring appointments at doctors' office and a thousand other scenarios) but the writers were unaware of how to convert them into full episodes. They end up exaggerating a bit too much and that is when it stops being funny. Also, since there is leeway to curse, be gross etc., the show takes it too far and it borders on being crass. The angry, lengthy shouting matches just do not work and it is very hard to pay attention. I have zoned out through several episodes or stopped watching them altogether midway through the episode. The other big issue with the show is that Larry David and all the recurring characters on the show (without exception) are very bad actors. They are neither good at improv nor can they do scripted dialogue without it seeming like they are trying to remember lines. Bland, monotonous performances across the board. I love Larry David and think that he is a genius but this show just doesn't cut it for me. However, I will give the show some props for venturing into edgy areas and being politically incorrect at times.
