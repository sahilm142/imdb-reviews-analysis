 Taxi Driver (1976)-A Film With A Fatally Flawed Storyline

 Taxi Driver is Taxi Drivel

 Dreadful crock

 Extremely Disappointed

 What a movie.

 This is the type of film I like, and I didn't enjoy it at all

 boring

 Classic example of a movie that is solely carried by an actor

 2 hour piece of c¤¤p

 Nihilistic in its spirit and its structure: a feeble attempt to display power

 I'll never get that 2 hrs back

 Bronson, Eastwood, Seagal, Norris... Showed the same in a far most believable way

 Taxi Driver

 This may shock film fans...
