 Bad must be the new good...

 Hype beats quality?

 Short stories, unfortunately not short enough

 Over rated, flawed and deus ex machina

 Same old Netflix agendas but in gringy animated form

 If you're into stupid stuff with aliens, monsters, hardcore violence, unnecessary nudity this is your 10/10 series

 worst Sci Fi writing ever...

 Just ewwww

 Good Animation Bad Animation + REALLY BAD WRITING AND ACTING

 Social engineering

 Raving reviews

 Written by men, for men.

 Worst Netflix production i've ever seen

 Made by stupid people for stupid people

 Sucks

 Trying for Black Mirror - failing

 Sexist, childish, boring

 WORST SHOW EVER! don't watch it! boring, senseless and extremely Weird

 I would have given it a 10 star if I were a teenager.

 Glamorises violence

 Probably a great show, should have hired a better audio engineer.
