 A surprisingly pleasant, silly yet witty show.

 Was great, until Season 5

 Time to reset the writing team

 Not the smartest, but good !!

 Don't bother watching after season 2

 Gets better and better

 Some pretty funny moments, but...

 You have to ease into it, like new shoes.

 My opinion about Brooklyn Nine-Nine

 Hilarious

 Funny but Laced with Many Modern Clichés

 Good tv show with some bad acting

 Great

 Chappy Watched: Brooklyn Nine-Nine - Seasons 1-2
