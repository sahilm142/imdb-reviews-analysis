 Cinematic Theater Of A Remarkable Kind

 Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?

 Fantastic acting, script, and direction in a thought-provoking movie

 " Just for laughs general, what was the war all about? "

 Post war courtroom drama still challenging and powerful today

 I think I've seen it 20 times

 Judgment has been made

 Excellent and timely

 Brilliant film

 "Those damned Eskimos"

 A Rare Film of Considerable Power

 Nuremburg quite timely today--treatment of disabled in particular

 great WWII movie, but relevant to today?

 Well worth the time

 Gripping!

 Longing for this kind of American idealism...

 Masterpiece

 The Bright Line of Guilt, Blurred

 Court drama in postwar Germany

 An unbiased and thought provoking look at whether German citizens must be made accountable for large scale crimes committed by there fellow countrymen.

 An extremely powerful, if slightly "preachy"film.

 Top acting

 The Burden of Responsibility

 Certain to be a nominee for Best Ensemble of a Movie, Ever!

 Three Generations of Imbeciles
