 good cop movie but a little long

 Good But Overlong

 The LAPD put the "heat" on a group of professional robbers.

 Cool

 De-Niro and Pacino pack it on.

 A masterpiece of action

 Fight of two character men

 good vdo rental 7/10

 Moody, Atmospheric, not terribly intelligent

 Turn up the heat

 Long movie, worth it

 Very good, a little long ***spoiler alert***

 Quite brilliant

 Superior thriller with some depth

 A nicely stretched but complete story

 DeNiro Feels the Heat from Pacino in This One

 Definitely could've been better

 One of the more necessary American crime films from recent years, as character as well as genre are given harsh redressings.

 The movie is good enough for a one time watch, especially seeing Al pacino and Robert Di Niro on screen together the only time.

 A Los Angeles crime saga...

 A well-executed crime drama

 Well-directed criminal tale

 Heat doesn't provide much heat

 Enthralling...and extremely overrated

 Good but not fantastic
