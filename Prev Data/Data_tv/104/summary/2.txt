 It made me write a review !!!

 What a shame

 TG is dead and this can't fill the void

 This is so scripted it is painful to watch...

 The Grand Bore

 So wanted it to work, but going downhill fast.

 Lets hope Season 2 is a lot better

 Sad demise of a great show

 Brilliant initially but now has become utter unbelievable

 The Geriatrics Tour

 Got old quickly

 Juvenile brain candy

 Stupid for the most part

 It's over.

 Before 2019, Grand Tour was awesome. What happened?

 One big ugly car commercial!
