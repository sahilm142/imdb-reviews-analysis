 Jack is great but the Original is MUCH BETTER

 Scorsese tries, almost succeeds, but fails in my eyes...

 No reason to vote

 Scorsese Should Have Made His Own Movie

 Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers

 Not as good as the original

 The Departed is Scorsese's most overrated film.

 Good, but not as good as the original

 Great film, but almost an exact copy of a greater film, namely Infernal Affairs

 Entertaining... and not much more

 watch original ;)

 Masking Good and Evil

 average, don't deserve so many Oscars.

 For 3/4ths of the movie a Good Film, and then, the ending!?

 Not as good as Infernal Affairs

 top ten stupidest endings

 Why a meaningless and unbelievable subplot?

 It could make a psychiatrist's head explode!

 great if you haven't seen Infernal Affairs

 Would give it 0 stars for this one reason

 a good film but less compelling than Goodfellas

 A testosterone-fuelled turn, The Depahted

 Great performances - but over rated, over all

 Nothing new for those who loved the original

 Very good until the end
