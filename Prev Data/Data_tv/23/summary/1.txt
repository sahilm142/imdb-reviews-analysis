 Desperately disappointed

 No friggin way this gets a 9 star rating!!!

 Slow AND dull

 Season 3, impossible to stay awake....

 Season 3 should be avoided

 Boring slow and more boring slow

 season 3- True Garbage!!

 Another Mumbling Mess

 Season 1 Brilliant.....Season 2 Death of Series!

 1st Season was Great! Second season is sinking fast.

 Season 3 never should have been made and certainly not released

 From Hero (Season 1) to Zero (Season 2)!!!

 True Detective: Season 2

 Season 2, just awful

 Season 3 is awful

 True boredom

 Boring, miserable, rubbish TV series

 What did he say?

 Slow paced and so boring

 Season 3: Like seasons 1 & 2, but angrier

 So so boring of S03 except there's only one thing worthy mentioning:

 Excellent first season, very poor second

 boring and way overrated

 Season 1 was great. All the rest SUCK

 Overacting ruins it for me
