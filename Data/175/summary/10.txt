 What Atmospheric Gothic-horror Should Be.

 All around, an excellent production.

 A Classic on par with "Citizen Kane"

 One of Hitchcock's best films

 My brief review of the film

 Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?

 My favorite Hitch

 Sucks you in totally...a high romance with astonishing sets and photography

 "Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again."

 Did he do it?

 Alfred Hitchcock's Most Beautiful Film

 Superb slow-burning psychological drama - classic Hitchcock

 Alfred Hitchcock Puts Hollywood on Edge

 a producer/director combination that works, elegantly and to the best of abilities

 The very definition of "Haunting"

 one of the greats

 Best movie ever!!!!

 Perfect

 An excellent mystery movie!

 Alfred Hitchcock's latest cameo (in the movie)

 "Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly..."

 An Ageless And Timeless Hitchock Film

 A movie that takes you to Mandeley, a mansion and leaves you in the midst of a mystery.

 Absolutely perfect Gothic Thriller that has many imitators but few of equal quality.

 Great movie!
