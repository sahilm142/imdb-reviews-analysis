"...if it's from a person who doesn't care about it." What really stands out for me (aside from the really excellent direction of the action sequences) is the too-brilliant for its own good script. Oldman,Reno, and Portman deliver lines that would seem goofy if spoken by lesser performers. Oldman especially chews the scenery in a way that's both amusing and utterly menacing. I wonder if his Beethoven obsession is a nod to the ultra-violent Alex from A Clockwork Orange?The American version ("The Professional") was the first version I saw. I'd originally had no real intention of seeing it because I'd read a pretty savage review of it likening it to child pornography. Clearly this particular reviewer had his head firmly planted in his rear. I'm surprised he could find room what with that tremendous stick in the way. Anyway, once I finally saw "Leon" for myself - thanks to my cinemaphile grandfather - I observed no such thing. This wasn't smut, it was love. Leon has no interest in Matilda sexually, but loves her as a father would love a daughter.If you have a choice then go for the longer director's cut. You get about 15 minutes more film - and not just filler. These are scenes that truly expand upon the story.My only complaints are about the almost complete under use of the completely underrated Danny Aiello, and Oldman's single dimensional evilness.


                
The downer about this film is finding out that Natalie Portman used to be an actress. What the heck happened? I didn't even recognize her as the same dis-engaged pretty face that she has become. Okay, do I really have to write ten lines about the film? I highly recommend it based on Portman's performance alone. Also, the interaction between her character Mathilda--a twelve-year-old--and Jean Reno's Leon is at once touching and horrifying, given the nature of the material. Is Leon criticizing Mathilda for talking to the boy in the street and her liberal use of profanity as a father-figure, or because he's training her to be the "professional cleaner" she wants to become. Portman really does steal the show, though. Her ease with delivering her lines, many quite profane and vulgar, is amazing. Entertaining without being vacuous, this is a fine movie.
you won't regret by the time you ended watching this movie.yeah you will feel good after watching it you know why because there was simplicity in it .it is appropriate that this movie do not teach you anything truth or spirit but what it shows is goodness Holiness with crime and passion . you are gonna love this believe me you are not regret it of you don't watch it


                
"Lèon" is a 1994 movie written and directed by Luc Besson and named after its central character played by Jean Reno. The film went almost completely under the radar in terms of awards recognition outside of France, but its reputation steadily rose over the years and it is now pretty much considered a classic. Besson was in his mid-30s when he made this movie, but already had a respectable résumé including a French and English version of "Nikita". For Reno and Oldman this is probably still the most famous work (not counting Oldman's efforts in the Batman movies) and for Portman it goes right along with other blockbusters like "V for Vendetta" and "Black Swan", which gave her the Oscar. I am still a bit disappointed Reno was not present at the ceremony. For Portman, Mathilda was the first role in a movie. Also in the film is Danny Aiello as a friend to Léon. His role wasn't clear early on to me as it seemed unsure what he was doing with the money, but as the film went on it showed that he was pretty close to Léon.The film begins with an introduction to what Léon does. He is a contract killer, who, in fact only want a little talk as we find out in the first sequence. The way he disappears into the dark is pretty cool. What is a more sad than cool is the one scene where Léon's loneliness is displayed. However, when we see him in the theater he does not seem to mind at all. His face expression while watching the movie is so much fun. He is also a milk junkie (just like myself). Sadly, I got no little girl that brings all this milk to me. There is many cult references closely connected with this film: the shades, the long coat, the piggy, the plant (rootless like Léon, nice quote), the chewing gum trick... After the intro, Portman and Oldman (character name Stansfield, a pill-popping Beethoven-listening psychopath cop) pretty much enter the film at the same time. Oldman's character is really scary, even his colleagues fear him. If you listen closely, Matilda's dad only dares to shout at Stansfield's partner Malky, not at him. The fact that Oldman is not physically intimidating at all makes him even scarier as he must be a complete nutcase if people three times his size fear him. Another little snippet: One of the actors who play Stansfield's helpers died during the terrorist attacks on 9/11 during his work as a firefighter 7 years after the movie. When Mathilda's family is killed, the writers already gave it their best to make them look as unlikeable as possible being very violent to their daughter/sister, except the very small one of course. It's pretty sad when Mathilda describes him as a kid who only wanted to cuddle. However, we also find out that her dad paid a tuition fee for one year in advance, so he can't be all bad. I wondered about Oldman's character why the internal commission isn't getting worried if so many people that cross his way keep dying.One of my favorite scenes from the film is when Mathilda returns with the milk, hears her family is dead and knocks on Léon's door. Very intense moment with her begging going against his principles. Finally he lets her in, physically and mentally into his life. He becomes her mentor, she becomes his housewife and quickly develops some sexual tension (quiz game for example or talk about virginity as well being at an age where girls start dating their classmates. She doesn't go to school, so there is no such possibility. At the same time, Léon also plays some kind of father figure to her. She looks up to him and also starts dressing more and more like him. Even if she seems very tough, there's a handful scenes where we see how immature and naive she really is, like when she tells the hotel worker that Léon is her lover or also her cartoon addiction or how she pours in the alcohol.The movie is at its most entertaining when the two go to work together. The scene with LaSardo (great actor) is pure gold and when they shoot the jogging politician from far away, it is also slightly special. Another funny comment by Léon is the "hurry or he will never shut up" after they run into gunshots. An emotional highlight is Mathilda's attempted suicide. She asks him what she is to him. He says nothing, yet contradicts himself by pulling the gun away in time. Almost a bit of a spoiler scene is when Léon tells Aiello's character to give Mathilda the money if something happens to him. One of the most intense scenes is when Stansfield and Mathilda meet in the bathroom. Edge-of-the-seat stuff and it shows that Stansfield is really scared of nothing, not even killing a girl in police headquarters. The possibly most beautiful camera shot of the film is when we see Léon and Mathilda reunited at one point and the camera shows us their feet. The last half hour is almost exclusively action sequences. I enjoyed these despite generally not being a great action movie fan. Maybe the reason is because you made such a strong connection to the two protagonists at this point already. Oldman's way of handling the final act says a lot about him as well. He stays outside of the action to not put his own life in danger, but is a coward who prefers to shoot his victims in the back. When Léon hits the ground, it is a pretty sad moment (just like the farewell scene a couple minutes earlier) as we see it from his perspective. The film ends with Mathilda deciding to go back to school and a beautiful Sting song before the credits roll in.Wonderful movie, over 2 hours very much worth watching.
Léon (Jean Reno) is a milk-drinking illiterate hit-man for Italian mob boss Uncle Tony (Danny Aiello) in NYC with his favorite plant. His next door neighbor 12 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman) has an abusive father (Michael Badalucco) who skimmed drugs off of Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Stansfield massacres the family. She comes home to find Stansfield's men still there. She fakes and walks over to Léon's. It turns out that they are corrupt DEA agents. Léon the cleaner reluctantly lets her in and she badgers him to teach her. She seeks revenge on his little brother's murderers.Director Luc Besson brings his often collaborator Jean Reno to America and makes a nice discovery with a young Natalie Portman. Before Hit-Girl, there was Mathilda. Gary Oldman is a superb strange bad guy. Luc Besson has a certain French flair with his action. He really has a unique take on the action thriller genre. It definitely has an edgy violent style that sometimes sexualized the young Portman. She takes on a lot of adult tendencies. That probably held it back a little back in the day.


                
Leon. A professional assassin rescues a young girl whose family were killed in a police raid conducted by a corrupt police officer. Girl teams up with the assassin to take the revenge. Now, the assassin here is 50+ played by famous Spanish actor Jean Reno, the girl is in her teens played by Oscar winner Natalie Portman and police officer is Gary Oldman who always enjoys himself so much when it comes to negative roles.Leon's strength lies in the unusual cracking chemistry between Jean and Natalie. Natalie wears her role so well that it's very difficult to take your eyes off. The scenes of Jean training Natalie the skills of being an assassin are laced with witty humor. The neat, uncluttered and linear screenplay helps movie's emotional strength so that you can absorb the feeling of the characters to the fullest. Gary Oldman gets lesser screen time than expected but does an astounding job as heartless corrupt police officer. Only false note that seems to be here is not showing is how Gary manages to run his evil business and gets full military support in the climax to take down one man and a girl. Action scenes are very well done and do not try to over shadow the emotional and intense undercurrent that flows in the story throughout.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Leon: The Professional. Watch it for its apt cast, great acting, super dialogs and highly emotional, intense, beautiful and subtle moments.


                
Action movie filmed using art house film techniques. As much art as it is enjoyment. Each scene carefully crafted to place both the eye as well as the need for action. A tale about an orphaned girl, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who happens to fall under the wing of a seasoned yet somewhat simple-minded assassin, Léon (Jean Reno). From there, an unexpected friendship blooms.What I like the most is the atmosphere. The world of this film is cruel. Officials are corrupt, you cannot trust your own parents, everyone is willing to look the other way and as a whole there's not much hope to be had. Yet the film's tone doesn't reflect that. Many of its scenes are lighthearted, perhaps a bit naive, but ultimately optimistic. In a lesser film this dichotomy would bother me, but here it works. Its part of the message, that there are pockets of goodness to be found, that not all bad men are evil, just like not all so called angels are good.The camera-work is also excellent, the pacing flawless and the characters are interesting. I must admit that I didn't find the story to be as captivating as I was led to believe, but I blame the hype, not the movie. The ending was also somewhat of a letdown, but it just means it wasn't my cup of tea, not that there was anything wrong with it.Léon is classic for a reason and rightfully considered to be Luc Besson's masterpiece. Worth a watch for all that are looking for an action movie with a soul.


                
Leon will stick with me for a long time. It is one of the few movies that I've seen that blends action, love, humor, and tragedy into a great film. Jean Reno's, Natalie Portman's, and Gary Oldman's acting was fantastic (It's a shame to see a talent like Natalie's wasted on horrible writing, like in Episode I/II. While I enjoyed both of those movies immensely, I hated the dialogue, especially between her and Anakin).I saw the uncut version, and from what I've read, the US cut ("The Professional") removes all of the tenderness between Leon and Matilda. Squeemish MPAA viewers who don't like the relationship between Leon and Matilda removed the film's most important parts (and for worried viewers out there- don't worry, nothing "happens", but their love is very well played, and quite believable).So anyway- see this movie, but the uncut version, not the US cut. It is one of my all-time favorites (on my top 10), and establishes Luc Besson as one of my favorite directors. If you haven't, also see The Fifth Element, and La Femme Nikita.10/10 - superb.


                
A magnificent film; Luc Besson has a singular style and directorial sensibility that keeps you watching.Jean Reno made that hitman role alive.
And acting of Natalie Portman is perfectly remarkable!!Leon: The Professional is a wonderful character study, enriched by outstanding performances, thrilling action, and a well-rounded script that gives the film an intriguing amount of depth.


                
an entertaining but also grave ,destructive,shocking and some gut wrenching shoots makes this film well worth to see. well acted performances by Reno and Portman,and some sting of hilariously funny shots of Gary Oldman,gave me some quick laughs. the pace in this movie could've been better,cause there are some very slow moments,but the telling is good,some may say its a bad script,but this film doesn't need more.the actors told the untold story with excellence definitely an 8,and goes on to my top 150 list.


                
10 outta 10 love it, for reals though nothing what I expected it to be good film nice script good actors nice camera work the 90s was a cool time 12 year old's smoked that was a bit weird it was also a bit weird seeing Natalie Portman as a 12 year old Leon was a total bad ass and Gary Oldman was amazing as always that man is like a chameleon when it comes to acting so different in every role and now I'm just taking up room so that my terrible review can be passed 10 lines is a lot IMDb lets see here it was a good film I'd absolutely watch it again and recommend it to friends and family alike a classic one might say I know I would 10 outta 10 would watch again


                
"Leon the professional" is one of those movies that will certainly leave you in awe after the first viewing. The plot is quite intriguing and original at the same time. It beautifully describes the story of a lonely and sad hit-man whom faith has bestowed the future of a smart but troubled little girl after her family was brutally murdered by a group of local corrupt policemen.The acting is very strong indeed. Natalie Portman delivers a top-notch performance in her breakthrough role as the distraught and very atypically 12 year old Mathilda who seeks revenge after the savagely killing of her family(especially of her little brother whom she cared for the most).IMO a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. Gary Oldman again accustoms us with a sharp delivery in the role of the villain who leads the pack of criminals. The portrayal of a psycothic and delusional corrupt officer is both convincing and unique at the same time. But the real tear-jerker is brought by Jean Reno's Leon character, a very innocent and warm-hearted hit-man(talk about great screenplay) who leads a desperate life of solitude until he meets Mathilda who will change him forever(the only thing that he was afraid to start with). Through the building up of the character you cannot simply be a stone-cold rock and not feel sympathy for Leon's struggle with the concept of love.The chemistry between him and Mathilda during the father-daughter relationship is awesome. A great cast overall but in the end it's Portman who steals the show!Also a huge compliment must be brought to the cinematography of the movie. Scenes like the angelic aura that surround Mathilda when Leon opens the door and implicitly saves her life or the one in which the same Leon bats itself with 2 handguns out from the ceiling of his apartment and right into the swarm of special-ops troops-men are beautifully and artistically created. Another big player is the melodic part which only adds up to the intensity of the on-going drama.To sum it all up Luc Besson once again amazes us after the huge successfully 'Le femme fatal Nikita' in creating a masterwork that touches you very deep emotionally and makes you very compassionate towards it's characters. Having fulfilled it's role as a film the only regret that this movie can possibly have is being 'born' in what i regard as 'movies annus dominis' along masterpieces like 'The shawshank redemption', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Forrest Gump' thus cutting loose any change of critics recognition at Oscars(which is quite deserving for such a film)


                
I fell like there is really not much to say about this movie. It has its ups and downs and I am not sure if it deserves all the praise that has been going around, but it is still a consistent good movie. It poses an interesting story and a different take at an action movie, in a decade when bad, over the top action movies were the thing. The performances are overall good, especially Jean Reno, as the ruthless assassin fatherly loving figure, and Natalie Portman, the character that we sometimes forget is a child. Gary Oldman gives all his heart, but his performance can only be as good as the one-dimensional villain he is portraying.
The story is, on one hand, well designed and different, specially the constant efforts of Léon to adapt to his new role of caretaker. Mathilda's constant uncomfortable approaches make it even better and are the clear result of a way too brief and dysfunctional childhood. On the other hand, it still falls sometimes into the predictability of the typical 'redemption arc' formula.
Overall a refreshing approach to the genre, with smart use of action and an engaging plot.


                
I re-watched the movie yesterday and just can state - this movie does not age. A fine and well forged piece of a thriller with some unusual ideas and wonderful actors. The only sad fact - i can't remember one movie of the crime/drama genre with so much quality in the past years (well, maybe with the exception of Sicario and No Country For Old Men). Anyway, Léon belongs like Pulp Fiction, American History X and The Godfather to the absolute highlights of the crime/drama/thriller genre, and Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and the young Portman delivered some of their finest performances ever.If you never watched this one, maybe because of your age, watch.


                
The chemistry between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman is absolutely perfect. The Young Natalie Portman is an absolute revelation in this dark film that has a beautiful and realistic end. One of my Luc Besson favorites


                
Safe to say this film has spawned many iterations of omnipotent invincible hitmen, it isn't hard to see why. Opening to a lukewarm reception, Léon has rapidly garnered cult status and is a firm favourite amongst film aficionados. A young girl's family is brutally gunned down by a crooked detective, she teams up with a hitman named Léon in order to avenge their deaths. Suffice to say this is an action drama that needs to be viewed by everyone...and I mean "EVERYONEEEE!". It would be easy to class this as an exaggerative over-the-top action thrill ride, but it's so much more than that. Thanks to Besson's Parisian directing style, he focussed his attention to the quirky original relationship between Léon and Mathilda. A girl who has experienced the dark side of life, growing up with a father who deals drugs and regularly hooking up with women. To then be embraced by a determined yet warming hitman, her idyllic fantasy of a caring father figure becomes reality. The bond that rapidly forms between these two characters is fascinating to watch. Her idolisation for him and his protectiveness for her. It's a union that shouldn't work, but does. They both teach each other aspects of life they aren't necessarily familiar with, which furthers the intricate character development. Acting was terrific from everyone. Reno's commanding titular performance encapsulated the screen. Portman's debut is quite possibly the best child performance I've seen. And then there's Oldman as the crazed antagonist, who steals every scene. Whilst this is absolutely entertaining, there are obvious issues. The plot is too thin to carry the full runtime, it takes far too much time developing the character relationship where the actual plot feels neglected, leaving the antagonist on the sideline until the third act. Also the music choice occasionally didn't fit the bustling urban environment and took me out of the film. Aside from those points, it's considerably better than most crime dramas and has aged impeccably well. Everyone needs a Léon in their life.


                
Luc Besson has made a name for himself making films with offbeat story lines and characters; and this one is an addition to his list of memorable films. Wonderfully cast and beautifully shot, The Professional is a film that keeps the audience on it's toes from opening credits til "The End". Gary Oldman shines as the deliciously nutty dirty cop Stansfield, and there is good reason as to why this is one of his more famous roles. With over the top delivery in such lines as "EVERYONE!" it's impossible to take your eyes off of Oldman. Jean Reno is also someone you refuse not to watch. His character's ruthless ability to kill, colored by his childish innocence despite his career as a hired killer make him lovable and sympathetic. And the heartbreaking performance from the wonderful Natalie Portman as the confused and older than her years Mathilda, who is orphaned by the murderous Stansfield and is driven by a thirst for revenge; makes your heart stop, and the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. Though full of course language and lots of blood, the film is an enjoyable one; and a must see for Reno, Portman and Oldman fans everywhere.
Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - "It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality" as Gary Oldman very well put it.In "The making of The Professional" Besson says "If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think "It's in me, I'm a beast!" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable "EVERYONE!" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: "everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in "real life"? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.


                
The film opens with one of those virtuoso shots which zips down the streets of New York and in through a door, coming to a sudden halt at a plate of Italian food and then looking up at its owner. Besson must have been watching the opening of the old Letterman show. The man eating the food is a mob boss, played by Danny Aiello, who wants to put a contract on a guy. The man who has come whizzing through the streets is Leon (Jean Reno), a skillful but uneducated "cleaner," or professional hit-man But always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action.I have now started finding better movies through www.flicks tree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online. **Highly recommended**.


                
"Professional" is one of those movies that enchants the viewer, it's sad, it's funny, sensual, violent, dramatic and with good action doses, is a film that is to please all without leaving aside its good construction because all these elements are not thrown in any way screen with a simple but good script (although it contains some holes), a sensational soundtrack, very well orchestrated that controls the pace of the film, with a clear picture, we are talking about professional killers and the film has a clean, clear and beautiful picture (remember a little pulb fiction), a sound mixing precise and perfect assembly, the assembly of this film is sensational, and the camera angles reminiscent of the best work of Scorsese, let's talk about the beautiful performances, especially Natalie Portman that as Mathilda (with I2 years), is the second best performance of his career (second only to black swan), the film tells the story of a girl after her family slain is created by a hired assassin who teaches the killing, Mathilda fall in love with this killer and rehearses to a sexual desire for the same, the story is heavy, but captive, and is light and addictive, Luc Besson does an excellent job in this movie.
It's funny, I remember seeing the laserdisc for "Léon" at a store back in the '90s. The cover featured a blurb that read (I'm paraphrasing from memory), "It'll make 'Speed' feel like a slow ride to Grandma's house", which always left with me with a particular thrill-ride impression. The truth couldn't be any further from that description, but there's something deeper here than just action junk food and that's why the movie comes on like a sucker punch.Everyone in this cast is extremely well chosen, but Oldman threatens to steal the show with his signature psychopathy. Geez, that guy. And on the subject of action, this has it, no question. When Reno dons his beanie, you know you're in for some bloody fun. But the movie's real asset is the pairing of hit-man and orphan (Reno and Portman, respectively). It's an unlikely relationship, but also earnest enough to really go for the heart at just the right point.It may look and feel like a Luc Besson action movie, but it's very well made and thoughtful in its sadistic approach. There's emotional resonance here, to be sure.8/10


                
While many action movies tend to suffer from being style over substance, this movie provides just enough depth to make us care for the two main characters in this movie. Also, the plot has a few other changes added to it which makes it seem more interesting and original than many other action films of the genre.After a young girl's family is murdered, she meets a hit man who takes her in and the two bond over their time together as they develop an odd friendship with each other.One thing good about it is that it doesn't consist entirely of non-stop repetitive action scenes. Large portions of the film are focused on establishing the chemistry and bonding of the 2 leads: Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman). At the beginning of the movie, Mathilda's whole family is murdered. Though she didn't like most of her family, the death of her 4-year old brother has a negative impact on her as he was the only one in her family who she cared about. Her bonding with Leon is an interesting plot point as he was one of the only people who she really cared about. The time they spend together made me grow an attachment to them.Because of this slightly risky choice, however, some people argued that Leon was a pedophile and Mathilda's character was too overly-sexualized. To some extent, I could see why someone would think that, but there are reasons for this. Mathilda came from a broken home where she had a burning hatred towards most of her family members. Leon was one of the only people that she cared for. Also, since she was 12, she was probably just starting to go through puberty and was just starting to discover her sexual feelings towards others. She even admitted to Leon that she was (or thought she was) falling in love with him. Despite her efforts to flirt with him, Leon thankfully refused her attempts and he chose to love her more as a father than to actually share a romance with her. I don't agree with these arguments that much and I think that the movie handled that plot point in the most appropriate way it could.Also, the acting is really great in this film. Most people usually mention how Natalie Portman gave a fantastic performance and I agree with that. It's hard to find a really good child actor in most films, but she was exceptional in her role. Even though I felt like she was a little annoying at times, those few scenes did not break all of the other scenes she was in where she was able to show different emotions very convincingly. She was able to go from a frightened young child to someone capable of killing so convincingly, it makes her relationship with Leon more realistic and plausible.Jean Reno gave an intense and solid performance too. None of his lines were ever cringeworthy and his face conveys a great myriad of numerous emotions and great sensitivity which in a way, made the action scenes slightly better. He did a good job in the movie, but I don't think that enough credit is going to Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman as Stansfield gave an exceptional role as the villain. He is able to look threatening just at the sight of him. Every time he's on screen, you feel a sense of uneasiness and a sense that something bad is about to happen. In one of the scenes when he confronts Mathilda in the bathroom, that scene is very tense not just because of the most obvious reason, but because his performance gives the scene quite an unnerving feel to it. All 3 of them expertly carried the movie and I can't think of any other actors or actresses who would better fit their roles.Unfortunately, however, like many other action movies I've seen, I felt that one viewing was enough for me. At its core, it is a pretty genuine action movie and I felt like it didn't provide enough that made me want to revisit it for future viewings since I was already aware of what happened in it. My reason for this has a lot to do with the fact that I wasn't too engaged by its action scenes. "Mad Max: Fury Road" has extremely absorbing action so I wanted to revisit that one after I watched it, but I can't say the same about this one. Is this point subjective? Yes, but I can't help the fact that I feel this way.In conclusion, this was a very great movie. I do feel like one viewing is enough for me, but that's not to say that it's a bad movie by any means. It contains original and interesting plot points, characters which I cared for, and outstanding acting performances for the 3 main leads. It is a great movie, and I'm glad that I checked it out. I can understand why so many people like this film.


                
With the brilliant acting of Jean Reno and a young Natalie Portman, and with the brilliant direction of Luc Besson, Léon: The Professional is sure to please any action fanatic or drama lover. From the opening scene of this movie, you can tell that every take was thought out and every take has a unique mood. Léon: the Professional isn't without its flaws, however, which I will outline later in the review. One aspect that Besson really put his back into was the characters, and it shows. A young Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, a down on her luck kid who craves revenge and a parental figure to guide her through a tough part of her life. Léon, played by Jean Reno, truly is the star of this film. Léon is a notorious Italian assassin who travels on a path of self discovery throughout this whole film. With every word that Léon speaks you can sense a deep and daring combination of optimism, pessimism, and darkness. Though he is a rather quiet character, just the tone in Léon's voice shows that he is a true striking mafia man. Finally, the villain in this film, played by Gary Oldman, is a devious character. As the film progresses, your hate for him builds up inside. My one issue with Oldman's character, however, is that you cannot relate to him. All good villains should have a reason for what they are doing and something in common with the protagonist, in this case Léon. This was not present in Oldman's character. Aside from this one minor flaw, great, realistic but still awesome characters made this film what it is. As great as the characters are, when I think of this movie I will always first think of its incredible score, composed by John Altman. Every step of the way the score perfectly accompanies the mood of the scene. It is a perfect example of how symphony music doesn't just appeal to the wide arrange of 80 year old's throughout the world, but can also appeal to many more people if executed correctly, which it was. As my title would suggest, Léon can't be fit into one genre, but many. The action aspect of this film is incredible. With near complete use of practical effects and Besson's history in directing great action films, you really marvel at how certain scene's were created (particularly the end of act three, like holy crap!). The drama and emotional conflict in this film is also substantial. You can understand and relate to many of the characters in this movie, and really feel what they are feeling for a lot of the film (aside from the large number of people in this film that get shot, that would hurt like hell and as a result Besson didn't include that aspect for viewers). There is also a strange feeling of romance in this film, but that gets into spoiler territory so I should shut up! One slight issue that I have always had in this film is not what is present, but what is not, for the majority of the film. Unlike most other films, my favorite moment in Léon: the Professional is the first act. There is a deep feeling of darkness and actual fear throughout the whole first act. You get the horrendous feeling that something awful will happen, and it does. I would've liked to see that feeling of darkness a bit more throughout the film. Not the whole time, but I think that feeling could have added a lot to a few scenes. In conclusion, Léon the Professional is a gorgeous, musical, grim, witty, and brilliantly put together film. For this reason it deserves an A- (8.3/10).


                
A hit man, Leon, lives alone, working hard under an Italian mafia. One day he saves a girl, Mathilda, who lives in next room in the same apartment. Her father steals drag which belongs to a drag gang and it is found by a narcotics agent. The agents kill the family all, even a youngest brother. Fortunately Mathilda is not home at that moment, but she loses her family, left alone. She doesn't have anyone that she counts on except for Leon. She begs Leon to teach how to use guns for taking avenge. Firstly he refuses it, but he cannot forsake her and starts to educate Mathilda to be a hit man. It's very beautiful that the fusion of Leon's loneliness and Mathilda's one. Their love is too complicated to tell clearly; its style is different from the love of couple, friend and family. However I'm sure that both of them found something treasure through the time they spent together. Gary Oldman acted one of the biggest villain in the movie history. I guess this film would not succeed in like now without him.


                
This is a gripping story about a hit-man named Leon (Jean Reno), who takes in a young girl named Mathilda (Natalie Portman) after her family was murdered by corrupt DEA agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Léon and Mathilda form a bond as she learns from Leon's work as an assassin. They have great chemistry together and is heartfelt to see that Leon will go far and wide to ensure that Mathilda is safe from the bad guys that are after them both.Portman gave a great performance, truly remarkable at such a young age back then. Reno gave a stunning and dramatic performance - truly having screen presence and delves into the suspense of the film. ***spoiler ahead*** What is sad is that Leon didn't get a very fate at the end and Stansfield didn't get enough of a taste of his own medicine. ***spoiler ends*** Overall, the movie is full of action and intrigue and is one of the more unique crime thrillers out there.
