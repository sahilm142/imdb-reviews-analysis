 Hooked on "Hannibal"

 I proudly vote 10000000/10 for this Master Piece

 Finally, a show with class

 More than a TV show, a work of art.

 Elegant, Subtle and in Excellent Taste.

 So good that I fear for it not getting renewed

 Fascinating psychopathy at its finest. Filling every thrill seeking part of the psyche.

 Creepy, unsettling and beautiful

 A macabre world filled with intelligent twists.

 Excellent consistency

 What a shame...

 Hannibal: Complex and Dark

 Masterpiece from the most unlikely of content.

 Breathtaking and endlessly smart

 Exactly what you would expect... and more.

 Gorgeous

 BRING BACK HANNIBAL!

 A Kubrickian Romance

 Another beautifully rendered portrait of Hannibal and Will Graham

 A masterpiece not fit for the average viewer

 WHERE'S SEASON 4?!?!?!

 Completely recommend this psychological thriller!

 Beautifully macabre

 A show as captivating as it is beautiful.

 Great pilot, but is it moving too quickly?
