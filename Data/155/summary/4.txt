 I fell asleep in the opening scene.

 Jeez, can't we just bury this one?

 Pretty, but boring.

 Bland yawner

 Why the drooling blind respect?

 Visually impressive, but lacks story and focus.

 Those Who Enjoy Deep Story/Character Flicks Need Not Apply

 Looks great, deep message, poor story

 Visual triumph but monotonous movie

 Fatally overrated, this film is remarkably dull.

 A cult classic film, but not for me.

 The Emperor's New Clothes?

 What can be more human than human? Duh?

 Nice visuals but loses most of Philip Dick's story

 Overhyped!

 Based on "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"... really?!

 Didn't Like It

 Why, oh, why 8.7?

 Garbage

 The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078

 Didn't care for it.

 Pure and simple: A severe Acid Trip

 Disappointing...

 Not the worst but hardly worth watching

 The Future is mean, ugly...and rather dull.
