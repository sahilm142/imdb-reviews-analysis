 A Sad Western Well-Told

 The Greatest Western of All Time

 Defined my very idea of "friendship" at age 10.

 A stellar adaptation

 Enjoy the book, then enjoy this..

 One of the greatest things that ever graced television

 One of the Best Westerns of All Time

 You must watch it all, before the full impact can be experienced

 A Loyal Adaptation of a Great Book

 Best Mini-Series Ever

 One of the greatest epics ever made!!

 It's all about tone and the performances

 The return of the mini series in a big way
