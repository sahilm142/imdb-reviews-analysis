 slight of hand pick pocket instead of magic

 Criminally Overrated Film....

 I'd rather watch "The Shining" over...

 My lovely friend Emma's review!

 Did you say "death" ?

 A Titanic-like film, which is to say really over-rated

 This is the most overrated movie I've seen all summer!

 Who writes these reviews, the studio?

 Schizo directing-what were they trying to do here?

 Boring with a predictable ending. That's right, predictable!

 Not quite as good as I thought it would be

 Not anything like as good as people seem to think

 Silly segments completely ruin the movie

 Another M. Night Shyamalan disaster

 Great meaning - doesn't make sense though

 See it again and tell me if you still like it

 First of a kind

 An ending doesn't make a movie folks!

 A single unexpected twist does not make a good film

 Not a horror movie

 No Sense of Direction

 Disappointing

 one great twist. nothing more, nothing less

 pastiche formula

 Best ending ? Well check it out twice, you'll notice it's real bad
