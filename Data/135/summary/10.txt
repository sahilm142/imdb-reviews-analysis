 My favourite Miyazaki!

 Thank you so much for this movie Mr. Miyazaki

 Look in an another view point

 Amazing!

 Best Ever

 Hayao Miyazaki casts his spell on us

 A fantastic fairy Tale from Miyazaki

 Original and Thoughtful

 One of the best animated movies of ALL TIME - classic status, STAT!

 Overwhelming and beautiful

 A somewhat lesser yet imaginative fairy tale from Hayao Miyazaki.

 Howl Stole My Heart

 Great movie!

 Made me feel like a kid again

 Loved it!

 Best Miyazaki Film

 Wow

 An animated feature about a young girl, curses, and finding one's dreams

 Howl's Moving Castle is almost better than Sen to Chihiro.

 A profound and exhilarating Miyazaki creation!

 i loved it
