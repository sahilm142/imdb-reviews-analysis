 Overwrought Wartime Romance

 Doesn't hold up to hype

 Over-hyped

 If it's so great, how come you never watch it?

 Was it just that Ingrid Bergman Looked Beautiful?

 Didn't care for it

 A Fine Fantasy for Men

 This film has badly aged

 The Movie Is As Cardboard As The Plane

 War Propaganda or a "B" Movie ? Or Both ?

 Casaboring

 Best film ever made.

 Ehh...

 A film with some plot holes, but okay entertainment.
