 This movie is terrible and WAY overrated...

 Bad Movie

 Boring Boring |Boring

 I gave up

 A remake of a non-existent movie

 Charlie Kaufman is not The Second Coming

 Failure at superlative - the sickness of our times

 Overrated

 Underwhelming

 Disappointing

 Hated it

 Just abysmal

 A Piece of Crap

 My thoughts on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

 Eternal Sunshine tries so hard to be a movie.

 A DULL CHORE to watch!

 saccharine...

 Alexander Pope is rolling over in his grave

 This movie is terrible.

 So little to say in so much time

 pretentious, bad film

 interesting had a powerful star as the main

 I have already blanked this one out of my mind....

 Sorely Disappointing...

 This movie didn't work for me
