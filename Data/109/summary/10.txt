 Early science fiction story that presents a pessimistic prediction of a future society.

 Restored Kino DVD changed my view of this film.

 Heart is the Mediator Between Brains and Muscles <U+0096> A Futuristic View of the Fight of Classes

 My favourite film, my last review.

 The Mother of Modern Science Fiction *Spoiler*

 The "Blade Runner" of the '20's.

 a visual fable of the highest order- one of the five great future films ever made

 Finally definitive, and still pointing ahead

 A film student's view...

 Possibly the greatest silent film--if not, at least one of the very best

 The finest silent movie?

 Silent era icon
