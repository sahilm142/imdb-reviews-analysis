 The "grandest finale" ever

 Life is a river: not gently flowing, but a hostile swallower of the marginal.

 A Performance and Movie for the Ages

 Towards the character of Cabiria

 If there is empathy in cinema, it is here...

 Wonderful film.

 A beaten and bruised soul that cannot be hindered

 A great film about the innate goodness of humankind

 "Guess there's some justice in the world. You suffer, you go through hell. Then happiness comes along or everyone."

 Fellini's bitter-sweet classic: funny, sad, sweet, cynical and very engaging

 a potent feminism manifesto from Fellini and a master-class performance from Masina

 Loved it!

 What a beautiful, sad, uplifting film!

 Heartbreaking and Wonderful

 Great

 A Fellini classic
