 Mindlessness

 regurgitated slop

 Pretty terrible

 bored out of my mind with psychobabble & never ending yap

 Needs talent

 Complete waste of time

 I. just. can't.

 Bad. So bad. Really.

 Am I still sane?

 Mind-Bore!

 Snoozehunter

 Would Be Good... If They Didn't Twist the Facts

 could not even finish first episode

 Couldn't make it past the first episode

 So poorly written I barely made it through 1 episode

 Nope.. just nope..

 I really wanted to like this series.

 Watch something worthwhile instead of this!
