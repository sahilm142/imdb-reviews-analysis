The second part of the movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, this is a good-looking creation albeit not much else. It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects.


                
Peter Jackson has taken one of the greatest stories ever written and turned it into mindless action. First off, the script is horrid. Where did the genius of Tolkien disappear? The dialogue is cut down and resembles one-liners. The directing is unbelievably bad with constant camera movement making character development impossible. Fast cut scenes are at all times jumping at you from the screen so you never get the time to fully absorb the story, forget about the time to think. And you're not supposed to, there are no layers (they are magically gone, thanks to the decisions of Peter Jackson), what you see is what you get. Continuity and development are sacrificed to create a pill more easily swallowed. It's like a restaurant where they feed you, and if they do it fast enough then maybe you won't notice that the food isn't cooked. This might work with traditional action (because let's face it, we like them because they give us a 90 minute vacation from our brain), but in the case of LOTR it only goes to diminish and destroy a work of art. Probably the worst thing about this movie is the music score (still it's much better than FOTR, as it's less titanic). Anyone with any understanding of music will see how shallow the composition is. It reminds me of composed music used in computer games, poorly directed and lacking depth. Also it keeps blowing what little suspense it has by frequently changing to custom fit each and every scene. Really nice touch this considering that the scenes change without logic. From the midst of the battle of Helmsdeep to Merry and Pippin in a quiet forest. Somebody please explain to Peter how suspense is built. Besides this, the music has nothing to do with "the lord of the rings", it doesn't capture the right atmosphere and it keeps repeating itself. It's just there and it's there all the time, every scene (another poor directing decision. It didn't give FOTR an epic feel and it failed again in TT). Wouldn't it have been nice if the music featured in the television trailer was actually in the movie?In the storyline Jackson has made some unforgivable alterations. Tolkien would weep if he knew. The lord of the rings is mainly about the journey of Frodo, because if he fails then all is lost. This is also the most interesting part of the story because it is symbolic, dark and a psychological struggle. This is why two thirds of the books are about Frodo. In this second movie Jackson has devoted minimum screen time to this most important, atmospheric and perilous journey. In stead he has used countless minutes, not polishing the rest of the actual story (it often feels like it's on fast-forward and in many scenes the emphasis is on all the wrong things), but adding loads of new scenes which have nothing to do with anything. Apart from changing the story he has also changed some of the the characters (why?). Peter Jackson tries so hard to entertain us, deadly afraid that we'll get bored for even a second thus insulting our intelligence. He sets his own trap and blindly walks into it.**SPOILERS** The book is supposed to be dark, hope is supposed to fade and "the two towers" is supposed to end in the mountains of mordor with Frodo poisoned and taken captive by the orcs and Sam stuck in some dark underground maze with the ring and nowhere to go. Instead the movie ends with Sam giving an inspiring speech about those "favorite stories where all seems lost but where you know that the good guys will win in the end", in some idyllic forest far from mordor with a lot of light and sappy music. This sums up what injustice Jackson has done to the LOTR pretty good. **SPOILERS END**But why? Because Peter Jackson isn't the greatest director in the world. And because they wanted to make money and "the lord of the rings" as it is today is making buckets of it. They wanted a brainless action adventure that followed mainstream traditions that even children could pay to see. They wanted to sell Aragorn rangers and Arwen barbies. This I can understand, and if it weren't so the movie would never have been made. Work and a lot of money went into creating the visuals. What I can't understand is independent critics praising it, when clearly the movie is lacking. There's more to an epic than visuals. A darker, more true and intelligent tale would make a great movie, but it wouldn't make a sure box office income. In the end, FOTR and TT aren't that bad if you just look at them as action-adventure movies (specially FOTR). And one very good thing is that more people will now read the books. But they're just not Tolkien. And don't tell me that it doesn't matter, because it does. I was disappointed with both The fellowship of the ring and [specially] The two towers, not because they're so bad, but because they could have been so much better.
This film was such a disappointment compared to the first one... About EVERYTHING has changed from the book, and it is not for the better, that is for sure. I don't quite know where to begin:Frodo is made to look like he is totally under the rings spell, and that he does not see the treacherous nature of Gollum. But then suddenly he is himself for two seconds when discussing with Sam whether their adventure will be told in a song or story... WEIRD!Gollum is just wrong... His eyes are too cute, sort of...looks like a small baby (they are not too beautiful when they are a week or two old, to tell the truth...)Shadowfax is supposed to be the fairest horse there is; almost supernatural. In the film he is just an average horse, and not even the most beautiful horse of the film... As to Gandalf, he is supposed to look radiant and powerful, almost like a god! But he just looks like an old, tired man...The elves in Helms Deep...where did that come from!? The elves never came to the rescue in that battle!!!Faramir is reduced to a copy of his brother, something which really annoys me! And then he brings them to the city with him...?Poor Gimli is made to be a "JarJar"...he is just this helpless, useless person that we are to laugh at. Yes, he is helpless sometimes, especially when it comes to horses. The thing with Gimli willingly going up on a horse in the film is just wrong; he's terrified of riding horses, and will only do so if he gets to sit with Legolas on his horse.Aragorn is made too much of a hero; it almost made me sick (And I am a girl!!!)Why did they have Pippin bite that brooch off his cape instead of letting him try to run away from the orcs before throwing it in the grass, like he did in the book? He doesn't seem so heroic in the film...Why did they make it look like the Ents were not interested in helping?There is so much from "Two towers" that is not in the film...I guess it will be coming in the next one, though, so I won't complain too much about that...There are lots of other stuff I could have mentioned here, I am sure, but I will spare you for the rest. The first film was great, but Peter, you disappointed me with this one - I hope you do a better job with number three!


                
In a trilogy, the second part is always the most difficult to create because it loses the charm of the discovery and lacks the thrill of the conclusion. The goal is to develop the characters and conclude with a solid cliffhanger that will be resolved in the last part. Thus, it's not just passing by.Unfortunately, this movie is this kind. It fails to reach classics as "Star Wars V" or "BTTF 2" and it's as dull as "Star Trek 3". Nothing really fundamental happens here: it's just another steps in the journey. Moreover, the fluidity of the first movie is lost because the characters are now split into three groups. I dozed two times watching it: in the Rohan country and during the Helm's Deep battle.But the responsibility goes to Tolkien because LOTR aren't really three stories but a huge, colossal single story divided in three parts by the editor. And a night rainy battle will be always more exciting on a paper than on screen.To leave on a happier note, i must say that the extra are interesting and really help to understand all the passion that people have put in this trilogy. That's why the chain-maker is so funny: With his desperate and weary voice, he explains that armors needs thousands of rings, that rings come in three models and that in a day of work, he can chains as much as a big scarf!


                
The party has split, with Frodo and Sam continuing on to Mount Doom. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are chasing the orcs that captured Merry and Pippin. Gandalf is flying around naked on a giant eagle (thankfully not shown in the movie) and Boromir's moldering corpse is floating down the Anduin River. From here, the movie follows three story lines; Frodo and Sam capturing Gollum, Aragorn and company allying with Rohan against the forces of Saruman and Merry and Pippin meeting tree-like giants in Fangorn Forest.I'll be the Negative Nancy here and say this movie sucked. The acting took a nose dive, the sense of desperation that was repeatedly said to be there just didn't click and a major character was all but completely rewritten for some unfathomable reason.Elijah Wood (Frodo) developed a forced, annoying accent, a bad thing when he is supposed to be carrying half the movie. Sean Astin's (Sam) demeanor shifts toward his two traveling companions were jarring and forced, making Sam seem somewhat bipolar.As for the writing, there was just way too much going on with far too much attention being paid to the Battle of Helm's Deep and Frodo's encounter with Faramir, leaving Merry and Pippin's time with the Ents seem ironically hasty.This movie does have good points though. The cinematography was again, beautiful and the acting from several of the cast helped to somewhat mitigate the awfulness of Wood and Astin. While there was a hell of a lot going on, it flows by quickly and is paced well, though it doesn't seem especially urgent...like everyone keeps insisting on reminding us.
Well, here we go again with the second part. Hopefully the creators make as much money as they have expected, because that's what it's all about here.Most figures in computer games act better than the people in this film. The effects are also to be found in computer games and even better made there. There are in fact a little more humour in this part (in the first one there was almost none of it) and that comes from John Rhys-Davies who tries to make something artistic of his dwarf behind the beard.We don't see that much of the four boys or what they are supposed to be. This is far from Tolkien's intentions and one wonders indeed why grown-up people are that interested. If you are 11 years old or younger you might be entertained, but most people aren't.


                
Here are my point by point thoughts on Two Towers.--Right from the start, this film opens with a sequence more cartoonish than anything in Fellowship. It later provides a shoddy rationalization to bring Gandalf back from the dead. I feel that this trivializes his death in Fellowship, which was one of the more effectively dramatic moments in that film. I guess an apparent death results in one's return as a "whiter" version of oneself. Gandalf struts around like nothing happened. Also, when someone says that they were "sent back" from heaven "until my task is completed", I get the impression that they are borderline invincible. This diminishes any sense of danger in the storyline for this character, and also diminishes the theme of death in the film overall.--Another problem I have is with Gollum, who is annoying as soon as he appears. I suppose that's a personal gripe, but his mannerisms are rather obnoxious and hammy. He's practically unwatchable. His character is also a substandard attempt at writing a character with fake complexity. Gollum shifts between evil jerk and loyal nutcase. That's about it. One understands the character completely the moment his split personalities present themselves. Unfortunately, this shift in personality is repeatedly hammered into the viewer's brain. Yes, we got it the first time it was shown. Simply shifting between two thin personalities dozens of times does not create character depth or complexity. Also, was there ever a question that his evil jerk personality would ultimately emerge as the dominant one? At no point during these films did I think that he would choose NOT to steal the ring (even for a second), and I didn't even read the books. His inner conflict feels meaningless and superfluous to me.--The drab visuals make for some tedious viewing. Everything is gray. The environments are gray. The skies are gray. The bad guys are gray. Gollum is gray. The orcs are gray. The weapons are gray. The buildings are gray. The color scheme is way too monotonous and repetitive.--The stifling effects of the ring were already established by the end of Fellowship. We saw the effects of the ring on a variety of characters, so it's certainly frustrating that Two Towers continues to harp on this subject without further elaboration or complexity. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum basically just walk through gray environments for 3 hours while complaining about the ring's effects. We already spent 3 hours in Fellowship explaining this issue, and Two Towers brings nothing new to the table.--It's rarely mentioned, but this movie has one-dimensional, boring antagonists. We get very little time with any of them, and none of them are memorable. They're just generic caricatures to be "fought against" as necessary. There are standard bad guys that show up all over the place, like those big cartoon hyenas near the midpoint and the giant army near the end. A few memorable bad guys and some development would have made things a lot more engaging.--That leads us to the action, which has some uninspired choreography. The flaw of generic bad guys can be partially mitigated when the protagonists break out some awesome maneuvers or strategies. Very little of this appears in this movie. We mostly get basic sword swipes, arrow shots, and riding horses directly into swarms of baddies. You'd think that Helm's Deep would have some traps and attack strategies for whittling the enemy down as they approach the fortress, but such is not the case - thereby wasting an opportunity for some creative attacks. At one point it seemingly points to Aragorn and Gimli having some kind of plan, but Aragorn just throws Gimli into a swarm of hundreds of baddies. To be fair, there are a few good moments to be had near the end (e.g., the bomb, the giant ladders, etc.), but that's not saying much when one realizes that the battle lasts over 30 minutes.--The CGI is exposed more here than in Fellowship, with some particularly cartoonish moments (like the opening sequence, the big hyenas, etc.).--What is it, exactly, that the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie? Aragorn helps Gandalf cure a king, then he sits around and talks. It's also ironic that Gandalf is brought back from the dead, then given almost nothing to do. He spends much of the film off screen as he rides his horse to find reinforcements, a task that almost any other character could have completed. Meanwhile, the elves sit around and talk, mostly about stuff we already know. The humans sit around and talk, mostly about fighting but there's no discussion regarding battle strategy other than where they want to fight. They also walk around and put on armor. Merry and Pippin talk to a tree that takes forever to form sentences. I tell you, this movie is very difficult to sit through. --This movie also introduces one of the more unconvincing love triangles in cinematic history. Aragorn, Arwen, and that other chick. Why even bother having romance in this movie at all if you're not going to spend time on it, develop it, or make it important? Aragorn and Arwen have a brief discussion or two, then make-out. That's it. Also, Liv Tyler can't act.--One point that is related to Galdalf's contrived resurrection is this: there are various fake deaths of characters in this movie. Pippin and Aragorn are given "possible deaths", but the filmmakers (and/or original novelist) obviously don't want to kill off a main character. Of course, they do kill a random elf dude in an unwarranted moment of overdramatism. I'm not sure why I'm supposed to feel sorry for a guy that had a grand total of 30 seconds of screen time before his death.--Also, the wizardry in this film is not creative. There's not much in terms of spellcasting.
I read the book and know that recreating a well loved book is often a difficult task, so I tried to judge this movie based upon it own entertainment value and merits. I gotta say the scope of the battle scenes were huge and awe inspiring, and the FX for Gollum was excellent, but...As a story that is meant to elicit an emotional response this movie failed miserably.  Part of it must have been the hype that surrounded the movie, but alot of it was with the movies failure to be anything more than eye candy.  In defense of the director, it may not be possible to capture the scope of the epic that Tolkien created.  Maybe it is, but the way Jackson has done it has not compelled me to be interested in the fate of the characters.  Maybe its the acting.  I never really got any sense that I cared about any of the characters.I could rant on about any number of other issues, but you get the gist of my opinion... didn't do it for me.


                
Having read the books twice, and having enjoyed the first movie "Fellowship of the Ring" quite a bit, this one disappointed me. Too much emphasis on fight scenes and the crash and clash of swords, and some very needless (and not beneficial in my opinion) departure from Tolkien's original story lines. I did enjoy Gimli's humor, though!


                
The movie was great: beautiful pictures, great special effects, good actors,... IF you do not know the books!!!! The first movie was very near the story of the book. The second not. They changed too much details. Sometimes important 'details'. I was very disappointed! I hope, the third part will be better.


                
I know the special effects were great but I admit to getting bored in this film. I preferred the first episode.The plot line is very simple and getting a bit monotonous.
If there was more dialogue I might get to know the characters more and care about them. Maybe it helps if you have read the books, I haven't.Some of the lead male actors are quite attractive to look at but even that wasn't enough to keep me awake.New Zealand looks wonderful!


                
This is the worst film I have seen this year. The dialogue is poor, the acting, mediocre and the special affects, uninspiring. The Fellowship of the Ring was better but still nothing to write home about. All in all this film only just deserves a measly 4/10. My advice, stay at home!


                
If you haven't seen the first of the trilogy and/or read the book, don't bother going to this movie. Total confusion for three hours; such that, at the end of the film, the uninitiated don't even known what the two towers are/were. The movie is designed for the viewer (i.e., sucker)to run out and rent the first volume because we pick up right where that left off a year ago (which is when I saw it) and the viewer is expected to know exactly where that was, who all these people (and things) are and so on.  Then a bunch of kings and princes with beards show up, and I'm sorry but I just don't have time to tell them apart. Then there's that masochistic goblet or gobbin or some such thing prancing in a loin cloth with bug eyes and incessantly talking to himself. It's just too much, including all the fight scenes which go by so fast you can't figure who shot who. Great New Zealand scenery and excellent special effects might be worth the price of admission. However, this must be breaking sales records with repeat viewers who have an extra three hours (plus 15 minutes of previews) to see it twice in an attempt to figure it out.


                
To all the obsessed Lord of the Ring fans who keep raving this movie as if it were the best movie ever made...I'm sorry, I can't get over it. I"m just so disturbed with yall voters. I can't believe this movie is at the top of the TOP 250 list, with a 9.1 voting average. That's crazy, that's insane. I mean, I could understand that yall obviously loved the movie, but why such a high rating? This is crazy...it's not that good of a movie ( I personally didn't like it and suffered for three hours), but do you people realizing what movies yall are putting Lord of the Rings  ahead of?ahead of the....Godfather Trilogy Shawshank Redemption Braveheart Star Wars Original Trilogy Memento and other fantastic moviesI mean, these movies that I have just listed surpass Lord of the Rings by far, and to say that Lord of the Rings is better than movies such teh Godfather or Shawshank Redemption is atrocious, an insult to humanity.Here are the reasons why I didn't enjoy Lord of the Ring- The Two Towers....1. We don't get anything out of this movie...it's just a lame adventure fantasy sequel, nothing more. I mean, I understand there are symbollic elements in this movie like Good vs. Evil, the light and dark, and all that other crap, but after seeing this movie, I said to myself, "Did I gain anything from watching this movie?" The answer is no2. shallow characters- once again, we don't get to understand or get into these chracters. Peter Jackson does an absolute horrible job of character development and we don't get to know anything about these people! I mean, because he failed to do so, I simply do not care if Froto or any of his hobbit friends die...3. A showcase of graphics, nothing more- Peter Jackson concentrates too much on Computer graphics and cinemotagrophy that direction is lost...and the storyline just kinda rolls on without any real direction. The audience sees nothing but a bunch of random trees going around, a bunch of water gushing...blah blah blah, and a bunch of random slash- and tear battle scenes. I mean, I admit, the CGI and the cinematography in this movie was amazing, but the movie can't expect those to satisfy movie goers like me.4. Crappy character interaction- Once again, like my comment #2, this movie displays poor and artificial character interaction. I just can't feel any sense of connection between the characters. I mean, I could really feel the interaction between Red and Andy Dufraine in the Shawshank Redemption, and the interaction between the Star Wars chracters...but the interaction and dialogue in the Two Towers really stink.5. Too long, too boring, drags too much- Is this movie actually fun and entertaining?....no!!!! final answer. It's 3 hours for heavens sake! And it's too slow....and drags too much6. Why do we get bombarded with annoying characters? - um, I don't even know his name, and I don't care to remember, but that bulgy eyed skinny mutant creature was so freaking annoying! 10 X more annoying than Jar Jar Binks, now that's an insult!7. No humour- When a movie has absolutely no humor in it, it has a small chance of being good. Man...how stupid were the punchlines in this movie....really stupid!! It's sad when the only guy that's attempting to be funny is that dwarf dude with the ax. You notice that I don't even remember the character's names?...(that's because I don't care). Well, i do remember the names Froto, and Aragon, i think.8. pathetic romance- man....what pathetic romance. Why can't the movie be more detailed about Aragon's romance. That's sad.9. 10. 11. .......I could go on and on...but there's no use. You Lord of the Rings fans are just too crazy and hyped about this movie, that it's no use. I wish you could appreciate deeper movies like Brave heart or the God father, or more creative and aesthetic movies such as Memento, but no no no, you people think it's the best movie all time (that's pretty sad, I still can't believe that it's the #1 movie in the top 250).i suffered through this nerdy pointless movie, and i give it 3 out of 10 stars, just for the cinematography... yes, that's the only thing good i can say about this movie, the nice scenery.


                
The most fervent of LOTR fans seem to be those who have read the books. Having not read any Tolkien I will have to review the movie as a film in its own right.Although I have seen TFOTR (which I gave 4/10) I still found TTT somewhat of an overload of characters, races and politics.  If you like the books and you liked TFOTR then there isn't any point in reading a review that doesn't declare TTT as the best movie ever...but for those fans of films I will try and point out the main flaws.The biggest problem for those not fans of the books is that we simply don't care about the characters and nothing is done to make us care.  People are introduced to us and 10 minutes later when they are killed/revealed as having unrequited love/had their lands taken from them, we are actually supposed to care.  But why would we?The other criticism would be the overuse of trying to make you believe that the main characters might actually die, only to reveal later on that *gosh* they haven't.  To my count this was done three times and is rather cliche and boring.  Quite childish to be honest.To make it on its own strengths as a movie it needs to lose an hour at least, but I realise that would simply disgust people who avidly boast at the number of times they have read the books.  I said about the first one what I'll say about this...if you need to have already read the books to like the movie and care about the characters then it is *not* a good movie, and this is not a good movie.  I gave it 4/10 also.On the plus side, yes the scenery and computer effects were all wonderful. As were the effects in Terminator 2 but I don't hear anyone claim that as being the best movie of all time.  TTT is just childish nonsense that fails to appeal to children due to the running time and the fact that nothing really happens.


                
If you are not a rabid Lord of the Rings fan, don't bother going to see this movie. Highly over rated.  Lots of gore and special effects showing dark soldiers marching to battle.  Devoid of any real plot or character development.  This middle picture is obviously meant to stretch movie profits and little more.  NOT RECOMMENDED.


                
Perhaps it was the fate of the 'middle film' in the series, but Two Towers suffers from excessive plot and excessive pulls to the heart-strings to match.  It seemed that every character with at least a five minute span of character development eventually got their own democratic turn at dramatic lighting and sappy music with us all supposedly marveling at their remarkable valor as they marched into their next challenge.  After about three or four turns at that and about an hour and a half into the movie, I began wondering when the intermission was going to be.  The problem was, given very little time to get to know these characters, we began to wonder why we should care about their valiant acts or their noble deaths.I'm not sure that I can forgive the almost predictable, certainly tiresome, and problematically vapid bravado of the film to simply an excess of things going on.  The beauty of the film and the worthwhile performances of the cast might have induced me to forgive the relative lack of depth or magic in this rendering, had I not felt that I was being clumsily and unsuccessfully manipulated at every turn.I very much enjoyed Fellowship due to a skill I saw in distilling Tolkien's complex world into a meaningful exploration of character difference and temptation, as regarded each character's current and historical relationship to the ring of power.  This film continues to do so in the sequences that are perhaps the most rewarding, those involving the trio of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, a bizarre relationship but psychologically riveting.  We understand the complexity of the task of Frodo through both his own tortured visage and the reactions of those around him.  Conversely, the minute long introduction sequence between Aragorn and his new would be human love interest is hardly enough to inspire us to any level of emotional involvement, yet somehow we are supposed to believe that this two sentence exchange should be enough to carry the sub-plot through the rest of the film.  There is simply far too much that happens in this film for us to even understand the depth of what is going on, and there are far too many times when we are left with the feeling that at this moment we are expected to be moved to tears. Whiplash is probably a better description for the reaction.Despite my disappointment in the Two Towers, I still do look forward to the final film.  This film never relents in its lively and magnetic exposition of a rich other world.  Despite its inability to rouse me to any heights of passion in the battle of good versus evil, I am left still anxious to watch 'what happens next'.


                
I am not blaming the director who did a good job or the original story which is probably the very best of fantasy but this is the book/film where nothing much happens. It is stuck in the middle of the two episodes where something does happen.
So if you have to choose which one not to watch The Two Towers is the one to.... miss!


                
The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it.


                
I may not be a movie maker, or writer, or even a Phd in Tolkien World. Nevertheless, I am a great fan of him and of his books. I saw many commentaries around said that the issues on the movie are because of the difficult to make a book translation to the movies.It seems to me people are trying to refuse their own disappointments with the movie with this argument. The movements in the timeline of the movie are the first cliché, much like episode I and dozens of other movies. Lets make a quick comparison, episode I and Two Towers have three stories running at the same time: Frodo and Sam going to Mordor, Anakim Skywalker in a space battle, Gungans going to war in the fields, Merry and Pippin and treebeard, Obi-wan Kenobi and Qui-gon Jin against Darth Maul, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Helms Deep. 1) Chances are against the characters (Ok...we need drama) 2-TT) Frodo is captured by Faramir at the same time that treebeard and the ents decide to do nothing, at the same time the fortress begins to fall. 2-EPI) Anakin is lost inside the Trade Federation Ship, at the same time Amidala and hers guard are captured by the Vice Roy at the same Time Qui-Gon dies. 3-TT)The new hope appears with Eomer coming to help Helm´s Deep, at the same time treebeard discovers that fangorn is being destroyed (how could he not know that already remains a mistery) and calls the other ents to destroy Isengard at the same time Faramir set Frodo free. I have only looked to this small part of the movie, but there´s more to tell about the whole of it, I will just tell about some more clichés: 1) The father that does not want his daughter to marry 2) The hero that everyone know is a main character falls in battle (and everyone knows that he will return - it adds no Drama) 3) The hero that does not want the power that is his. 4) The king that does not listen to counsel. 5) The calm heroes that doesn´t want to enter the war, although all evidencies seems that they had no choice. 6) The useless character that has a great idea (Pippin).There´s many more that I will not put here now. In my opinion, Tolkien´s world is greater than this and much more interesting.


                
I picked this up because frankly there was nothing else to rent at the local video place and I expected it to be bad but not as terrible as it was.  Most of the "great" reviews on here were constructed by the crowd that has a low IQ, goes to malls and drinks 2 gallons of soda each day, suffice it to say, this is merely "eye candy" to folks like that but when you analyze the actual picture, it is absolutely worthless garbage even on that level.  I sat through 4 hours of this junk simply to be amazed at how terrible it was. The plot is so thin and the dialogue so silly that one is amazed at how many people were hired on this picture.  Spending millions of dollars, on mostly awful animated sequences that aren't done very well, the director has given people expecting a story nothing but reason to critique him. In one scene the light is very bright and when the scene is cut to a part which is illustrated with computers, it becomes dark, such inconsistencies are obvious throughout.  The battle scenes are supposed to be funny because some of the "heros" should have been killed long ago but they hack about 600 orcs.  Gosh, is this made for teens?  My grade: D.


                
This was the worst movie I ever saw in my life... The script is horrible, the dialogues pathetic, the direction is 'cliché' and the actors were amazingly bad directed.Those inserts and flashbacks in the movie are ridiculous and some dialogues are excessive because the image could explain it all. The soundtrack doesn't make an impact but dulls the scenes and the battles are laughable for those who saw 'alexander nevski', 'braveheart' and other epic/war movies.


                
My problems with this movie are many. The love for the first one really made me antsy to see the next installment. What i saw was a complete disregard for the characters and themes of the first film. The Two Towers introduced waaaaaaay too many characters while leaving established characters from the first film by the wayside. The procession of new characters became tiresome especially in the wake of Gandalf's near total disappearance from the film. The visuals continued to be astounding but i knew that from the first film. The action was larger on scale but lost all of the personal feeling from the fellowship. Helm's Deep quickly fell into the trap of repetition and sky shots of stuntmen and CGI. The rest of the story is supposed to be carried by Frodo and Sam and their journey towards Mt. Doom. I was wholly disappointed with Gollum who was well done technically but not as a character. The longwinded scenes of him talking to himself were tiresome and soon also became repetitious. I think Two Towers disproves the logic that bigger is always better. As Two Towers expanded a great story of a group with a goal into a giant world war epic that lost its characters in a sea of war.
This was a disappointing follow-up to the Fellowship of the Ring. The story additions and changes, including the alteration of several characters, annoyed me. The emphasis on the battle scenes bored me, and the trite jokes about the dwarf were dumb. Also, the tactics in the Helm's Deep battle scene were atrocious; king Theoden did things which would have got him massacred... (rush out in front of a horde of orcs with crossbows, which the camera showed clearly earlier)I wouldn't watch it again.


                
A shame : I never though the DVD of this movie would join the "trashcan" part of my collection (8 DVDs from a set of 160 so far)The first LoTR was a good movie even with the liberties taken with the original story.  It was acceptable and I've seen it twice so far.This one is just bad.  There is a lot of scenes added.  The real problem being they are mostly dumb, dull, ... pick yours.Those add-on were probably inserted to throw some stuff to a wider public (the 50-60 women ?).It could be because of the current world state, but I feel a shade of patriotism s*** in some of them too. The fact some of the character behaves the opposite they are supposed to do doesn't help.On a brighter note, the "Gandalf" first scene is interesting and well done. Everything else is worthless.  It does not worth the time I lost in front of it anyway.
