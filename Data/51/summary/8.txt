 Confusion, uncertainty, and paranoia as an art form: possibly.

 Not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original. ***1/2 (out of four)

 An example of Nolan's early spirit in movie making. A rare gem with a fantastic climax

 Bold. To say the least

 Memento Much Better Than Anticipated

 Exhausting but fascinating thriller

 Nolan's Most Interesting Masterpiece

 Time and Perspective

 Need to watch it again!

 In chronological order the movie would not be that good

 Nolan's Intellectual Debut

 Ghajini is not Copied

 just a review

 Memento is a Truly Intriguing Journey

 Great movie, definitely a thinker!

 Under hyped, over lauded, and damn good.

 an enigma wrapped in a conundrum, wrapped in a paradox

 OH.MY.GOD. Clever but confusing!

 very high and deep class movie.

 Don't mistake its backwards nature as a gimmick, it is an integral part of the nuanced narrative.

 Some memories are best forgotten

 Memento

 Crazy storytelling and brilliant twists from Christopher Nolan

 Don't read any more about this movie, go see it...now!

 My Head is Still Spinning
