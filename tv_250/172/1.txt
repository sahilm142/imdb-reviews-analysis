Well, I gave it a 1, but to be fair they did the best with the material at hand.Like many I was forced to read the book in high school. No one could tell me why. Recently, bored and looking through my library I found it and read Waugh again. Three days I can never have back.So I thought I'd rent the movie see if they could explain the significance of this tripe.Beautiful scenery, great direction, superb acting...BORING. It's like religious propaganda thrust down your throat. Sir Laurence Olivier does the dying scenes superbly but Diana Quick lays it on a bit thick as Julia when it comes to the hysterical religion scenes at the end of the story.I'd only recommend this if even Cliff's Notes of Brideshead are putting you to sleep.At least the language is boiled down from Waugh's WAY overdone "look at how smart I am" vocabulary. I'm no dummy in the language department, but Waugh is loquacious and the movie comes dangerously close to being so as well.everyone seems a little too cardboard and like they're trying so hard to make mediocre material into Shakespeare. It just ain't and never will be.A must miss.
This was a complete and utterly joke,i can't believe i spent 4 hours on this.. Cause it wasn't until then i realized nothing was about to happen at all,in any episode. Please don't believe the hype!!! Oops have to write some more lines to get approved. Okay.. Plot in summary: Middle aged man in second world war. Thinking back at his youth. Every day, every hour every second. If he just had had any fun in his life.. It's just about he and his drunk friend Sebastian and his teddy bear. Well, that's about it! Still have to write some more lines.. Hm. Yes it was a little bit about Sebastian's mother too.. By some strange reason, he considers her as the enemy. In four hours we didn't find out why.
