 Slow Scream

 sad

 Hard to swallow

 A fine premise / A disappointing execution

 Season 8: Going downhill, fast!

 Why the hoopla?

 From witty and fun to boring

 Cliché, to say the least.

 Started strong, lost its way with offensive language and soap opera drama

 A soap opera - as simple as that

 Gone Downhill

 Not really a legal show

 Nah
