Am I making this up? When I was just a kid I saw this on TV, and it was just so much better. The music was more dramatic, the voice acting was less-kiddified, and the whole movie had a more intense feel to it.I was so disappointed when I turned it on, that I promptly turned it off again. I wasn't going to let James Van Der Whatzit ruin one of my favorite childhood characters. Did they even watch the old one? Chances are, no, they didn't.Basically I'm frustrated. I was looking forward to reminiscing for a couple of hours, but I ended up doing laundry because I couldn't watch it. The excitement and maturity of the first English-version is lost to a bunch of silly ad-libs, squeaky voices, and muted music. Blech. Where can I find an old copy on DVD?


                
Interesting setup but lack of focus and engagement ruins this.A young girl, Sheeta, escapes from the clutches of some mysterious pirate-like villains. She ends up in a small village and is befriended by young boy, Pazu. However, the villains track them down, as do a variety of other people who seem keen to get their hands on the girl, and soon Sheeta and Pazu are fleeing for their lives...Pretty much your standard Hayao Miyazaki movie: intriguing and original setup, making the first few scenes quite interesting, followed by random, unfocused plot development and lack of character depth or development. Just becomes a mindless adventure story without any point.Animation is so-so. You can't put this down to being made in the 1980s - Disney films of the 1940s and 50s had better animation.The linear, rambling storyline and lack of thinking required should make this ideal for kids, though the long duration of the movie and jumbled plot might be too much for their concentration spans. This is certainly not a movie for intelligent adults.
