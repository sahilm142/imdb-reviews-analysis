Trailer Park Boys is of course a Canadian television classic and was a huge breakthrough hit for all those involved. The same characters and show are still kicking around in one form or another all these years later, everyone knows Bubbles and the guys when they see them pop up anywhere.It's just a bunch of heavily swearing, heavily drinking losers with no jobs who aren't particularly smart (especially Ricky), they grow, do and smoke drugs and eat lots and lots of chips and cheeseburgers and love Rush.So yes it's stupid and won't make anyone any smarter but what more do you need in just a half hour of entertainment and laughs than a guy named Bubbles getting bottles thrown at him?
