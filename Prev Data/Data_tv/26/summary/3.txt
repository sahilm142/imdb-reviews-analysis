 Takes a Brit to bring US TV some wit

 intelligent, fair, and hilarious

 Weekly awesome energy infused injection of peace and discussion!

 John Oliver is awesome

 More rare than a lamb chop in Hell's Kitchen

 Beats all the rest by a mile!

 Still relevant, just not as funny as it could be

 Remember when John Oliver didn't talk about Trump?

 Another Leap for Mankind

 A refreshing, cosmopolitan alternative to the Daily Show

 A once great show littered with Trump and his administration focus instead of in depth features

 Way too left wing

 Lost his credibility with me

 Pedantic, Annoying

 Once was good, but went so bad

 Corporate owned dribble

 Condescending liar who will say anything Time Warner wants him to

 Current Year Guy

 Worst Show

 Oliver is brainwashing

 Why this show beats the Daily Show

 Left- wing "news". Millenials- please stop watching this garbage and watch actual news

 Verrry innaresting development in the progressive comedy news ecosphere

 Awesome op-eds but ruined by excess crudity

 Sometimes funny, most times tasteless and cliche"
