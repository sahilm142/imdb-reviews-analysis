 Disappointing ending

 Gets More And More Conventional

 The Game is Losing its Throne

 Sorry to say i'm Over it

 Decent, but Overrated Fantasy Series

 Season 1-4 great after that not so much

 Soapopera in the middle ages

 Slowly declining

 Afraid To Show Feelings

 Great story, good acting, brilliant directing and scenery, TOO much porn and gratuity

 Soul of Shakespeare, soul of what acting represents

 Season 7 is below average television with an insanely high budget, nothing more.

 Surprisingly good

 Blood, Sex and Fantasy!

 Convincing sword and sorcery franchise

 Good but the books were (once again) better

 Pure escapism, but one that drags

 epic fantasy for adults

 Overrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Is there a story?

 Falling off

 Winter isn't coming, it was here all along

 Highly overrated

 When you're honest and step away from the hype and wanting to fit in with all of the fans, you will see what is likely the most overrated television show of all-time

 First episode too rushed, but getting better!
