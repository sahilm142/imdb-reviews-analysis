I am an Evangelion fan. Following the advice of many friends, I was waiting for this film with curiosity, although I was already much satisfied with the original and very surprising ending.Now I know: The End of Evangelion is one of the most disgusting and unpleasant artistic suicide I have ever seen. It literaly destroys the original series and intentions. Even Steven Seagal would have been more subtle. Shinji was a shy, full of complexes teenager, he is now an unbearable autist. Asuka was an upsetting lolita, she is now a psychotic killer. Rei, one the most FASCINATING characters in Japanese animation even becomes a mere Godzilla clone! All the secondary characters are exterminated like cattle.It's ultraviolent, it's sordid (Shinji masturbates while looking at Asuka!!! ), it is filled with nihilistic ideas and rubbish esoteric symbols (a very secondary aspect of the series) and worst of all, it wants to make us believe this is the 'real' ending of Evangelion. The real ending was about hope and was a new beginning. The End of Evangelion is a real end: the only thing left is a black hole, full of sad emptiness. The worst anime I saw in ten years.
