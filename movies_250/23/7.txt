Silence Of The Lambs is, in my opinion, one of the most emotionally charged thrillers ever filmed. Slightly over rated ( I did not feel it was good enough to win Best Picture at the time), and a bit uneven at times, but it does tell quite a compelling and engrossing story. Foster plays the role of Clarice Starling, a very young trainee at the FBI academy. She is assigned a case that will almost guarentee her a certified license of the FBI, but it won't be easy. It seems the Senators daughter has been kidnapped, and the branch seems to strongly suspect that it is tied in with the Buffalo Bill victims. These victims have been found, all female, and all missing several, various skin patterns from their bodies. All of the information that Starling needs to catch this freak is in the hands of one man, Dr. Hannibal Lechtor. There's only one problem...he won't talk to anybody. When he finally meets Clarice, he seems to melt at the first sight of her, and he does talk to her. He slowly gives her the information that she needs, but it's not for free. Through a bizarre, unique "pro quo", the doctor releases her data on one of his patients, who he is even convinced is the killer at large. ( Pro quo is a, "what's in it for me"? deal in which Foster must reveal something about herself, in order to get what she wants. Here's where it gets tricky. And this is all plays out beautifully: Clarice is warned that Lechtor is slicker then ice, and was strongly advised that "you do not want this man inside your head." Unfortunately, that is where Clarice is allowing him to go, at the mercy of him giving her the name of the patient that is going around with the nickname Buffalo Bill. And we learn why. It's not because she wants her FBI badge, she really cares about the victim who may or may not still be alive. She has a glimmer of hope that she is alive, and that she can indeed save her. Out of all victims, she just wants to save one. But can she save her own sanity while doing so? The Silence Of The Lambs is not a perfect movie, and neither was the book. I found a lot of it implasussible, and the over dramatic cinematography prevented me from giving this piece 8 stars. ( The end of the film, when Clarice is holding the phone, and she says the doctors name over and over like a skipping CD, when it is clear that he has hung up the phone, is an excellent example of what I am talking about. ) And it cannot be denied Hopkins stole the show with his performance. Scary and gruesome as hell, I think this still reigns supreme to this very day.
Hannibal. The very name sparks fear, discomfort, and ultimately recognition. He is one of the most popular screen characters of all time, the incarnation of evil, and yet strangely likable despite his distasteful savoring of human flesh. "I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of chianti," he tells FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) after she meets him in a prison, metal bars their only means of separation.Their first conversation and face-to-face interaction is a vital element of the film's narrative; the bars represent Starling's own self-defense; they have wide-open spaces that are easily penetrable. And Hannibal Lecter, a psychologist and cannibal, knows exactly how to reach past her own mental cell bars and crack into her brain, and he does so in the classic scene where she recalls memories from her childhood, of the lamb she tried to save...Agent Starling is on the case of a bizarre serial killer whose victims tend to be young women. Although they are unaware of his motives, it turns out the infamous "Buffalo Bill" is using the skin of these unfortunate victims for his own sick pleasure. He's not the sort of person you'd feel comfortable being stuck next to in an otherwise empty elevator.Clarice is smart, a feminine icon of the movies. Her brains are what propel her own investigation into the case while her desire to unearth the truth and succeed past the results of her male counterparts stems from a sort of egotistical dominance. Not many people comment upon Sterling's own sexuality, her almost overly excessive efforts at saving the victims (who happen to be females). Buffalo Bill seems to represent her own image of men: cruel creatures who inflict pain and suffering upon helpless women. Her sole friend, the only man she can rely on for help and inside tidbits, is an outcast upon society -- a metaphor for the repressed homosexuals who are abandoned by their own societies, shunned by those who feel they are not "normal." Harris's underlying implications of homosexuality and female dominance in the novel are admittedly stronger than in the film, although the presence of the suggestions is clearly evident under close examination.Or, it could just be about serial killers and FBI agents. You decide.Sure, the movie is famous, but we must ask ourselves whether or not the film's reputation has given it a better face over the year than it has deserved. It is well directed, but never does the film fascinate us as the bold and daring "Se7en" did. "Silence of the Lambs" is a fine film, but pales in comparison to some of its imitators and fellow genre occupants.The acting and writing is not at fault. Hopkins and Foster are superb. Hopkins received the most critical acclaim, although in 2001 we all realized that Foster was a key to the series as well, when she was unsuccessfully replaced with Julianne Moore in the sequel, "Hannibal," directed by Ridley Scott, which was a total failure and disappointment for the fans of the original and source material, the novels by Thomas Harris, who has reportedly never seen "Silence of the Lambs" for fear that it would influence his writing."Lambs," more than any other film in the series, is terribly manipulative, complete with tacky flashbacks that are out of place and all too convenient. That's where the film ultimately fails. The direction by Jonathan Demme is, truth be told, rather poor and borderline mediocre; Demme does not use cinematography to his advantage, does not use darker tones to evoke feelings from the prints as Fincher did with "Se7en." It's a great movie with convincing performances and a realistic script packaged in the form of a typical Hollywood thriller -- it might have a good reputation, it might be a good movie, but compared to other classics of the genre, "The Silence of the Lambs" just doesn't hold up as much as I had hoped it would after all these years. It's revolutionary, but isn't the masterpiece it used to be.On the plus side there's always that terrific ending to look forward to.


                
I should probably mention right up front that I am not a huge fan of thrillers and, in particular, I don't care for violent or gory films. Because of this, I have waited a very long time to finally getting around to seeing this film. The idea of a film about serial killers just doesn't appeal to me. However, there is also an obsessive part of me--the part of me that wants to see all the Best Picture Oscar winners. Apart from this film, there are maybe two others I need to complete this...until next year! And, my daughter assured me that the movie wasn't too gory. So, this film review is best appreciated by others who just aren't into gore, serial killings and cannibalism--though, oddly, a very high percentage of viewers DO like such plots.First, the bad news. I sure as heck thought it was a gory film...a very gory film. You see people with huge chunks of skin ripped off, a guy's face ripped off and lots of blood. I don't know how my daughter would think this isn't gory! Second, the not so bad news. Although I really didn't like the film very much, it was interesting and different. Anthony Hopkins did a nice job playing a psycho murder--though I also felt this performance was anything but subtle--but it was entertaining. So did the film change my mind about the genre or this film in particular? No. But, apparently I am in the minority here.UPDATE: I recently began watching the TV show, "Hannibal", and although I also think it's way too graphic, I much prefer Mads Mikkelson's version of Dr. Lecter. It's much, much more subtle and creepy--without the over the top theatrics of the movie version of the guy.


                
What is so special about this film? I've watched it once, about a year ago, and could never figure it out myself. What I saw was a pretty good thriller which bombed out at the very end. I never thought the acting was all that great either. I think Anthony Hopkins was overacting, and I thought it was one of Jodie Foster's slightest performances. She had a more complex character in Freaky Friday. Oh, and the end that I mentioned above (I guess SPOILERS):
Jodie Foster just stumbles on Buffalo Bob while following her clues. It seemed believable to me that she might come upon him before she actually new exactly who she was confronting. But it also made the film seem rushed to actually have the final showdown as soon as she accidentally runs into Buffalo Bob. It almost seemed to me as if they decided that the movie was too long at that point, and that they should just let this coincidence develop into a finale, even if it was premature. If you don't understand what I am talking about, that is, if you thought the film ended at the correct time, read Roger Ebert's review of the film. I did not develop my opinion from his review either, he  just confirmed my suspicions. I don't think Silence of the Lambs was particularly fascinating elsewhere, but it was often entertaining. I would have given it a 7/10, but the sloppy ending knocks it down to a 6/10. Jesus, how did the Academy remember this at awards time. 1992 must have been a slow year.
I find "Silence of the Lambs" to be one of those movies that is hailed by one and all, and yet is underwhelming once watched - definitely good, but still underwhelming. You wonder what the hullabaloo was all about.The settings were cartoonishly murky and dungeon-like, to the point that Lecter's asylum (and at points even Clarice's FBI training centre) looked like Hell itself. I also personally disliked the "screaming lambs" scene; it felt unnecessary and dragged, and Jodie Foster's emotional reactions to Hannibal's questions felt absolutely out of place. As if he miraculously healed her of her long nightmare-sufferings in an Osho-esque way.
Overall, the camera work, sound and direction are all great. I especially loved those first-person shots with Hopkins and Clarice. Very claustrophobia-inducing.Coming to the acting, Anthony Hopkins, though mightily entertaining - very often chuckle-inducing with his sly sarcasm - came across as far from real. His performance was in no way what a true psychopath (especially one so well educated) would be like. I honestly did not find the man scary, though I did find his screen-presence charismatic and imposing.
Jodie Foster was excellent , her vulnerability, her subtle pretence in font of Hannibal, everything.
Ted Levine was marvellous - that strange voice, his quirky dialogue and body language - it all added up perfectly. A great example would be the scene where he gives a slight chuckle, and then runs behind a corner, when confronted at his house. Hard to believe this was the same man who played Pacino's subordinate cop in "Heat".
Scott Glenn underplays his role so well, that he seems disarmingly real - cool and calm. It's no surprise that Clarice wanted to work for this guy.Conclusion: SOTL is by all means a very a good film, but to be called one of the greatest movies of all time? I don't think so.
It's predecessor "Manhunter" (1986) is by all means the superior Hannibal film, and in my humble opinion, much, much more significant a film (and by significant, I mean more worthy of being preserved in archives for times ahead, than "Silence of the Lambs") . Sadly, "Manhunter", although a cult classic now, has always been criminally under-appreciated and misunderstood (strong emphasis on "misunderstood") and has since remained under the shadow of this one.


                
Manhunter is my Hannibal movie of choice. There aren't many to pick from, but it's the kind of choice you're frequently confronted with and says something about who you are; Alien or Aliens? So maybe this is yours. These films, to get into it a bit, are an offshoot of the many sophisticated threads that first came together in film noir (yet others led to Lynch). The most self-evident aspect is that they are detective films, but much more pertinently: they are about the effort to see and investigate into a part of your story that you didn't know was so dark. For Clarice, it's the screaming lambs and what it means for her as a person (lamb lost in a callous world). They are about twin-nested-worlds: the rational world of cops and forensic experts where the mind attempts control over narrative, and the semiconscious world of urges, self and powerful intuition that makes it all bubble up in the first place.The detective can solve the case because she straddles both.So, these films have power because they're not just about the case or cinematic criminology, that case which is usually wrapped in exotic madness to make you, the viewer, want to keep looking for answers. These answers horrify, assuming we are in sensitive hands, because that madness has, as a fulcrum, actual human beings in pain. We're a long way from Charlie Chan. The difference between detective and killer is not moral right, but having discovered ways to reason with that part of damaged self. Clarice has signed up for the FBI, and the FBI provides a structure (note the staged scenarios in training that allow her to exercise decision-making and control). Our anchor for the entire film is in her world of controlled emotion.Manhunter is my type of film because of a spin that seems very powerful to me; it ever-so-lightly transfers the anchor to the killer, in a way that we understand that that guy breathes and covets in an actual word, and that world has logic of its own, and that logic affects our logic and vision. Because we spend time there in ways that make deep sense, his world of latent visions deepens our own.Demme was not up to it here. So even though well-made, and even though Lecter explains that Buffalo Bill is a child that was hurt, every moment we spend in Bill's world is cheap and sensational. Demme goes to lengths of the silly dance routine in drag, but not so much as a glimpse inside the skin of that man. There is no real shift of vision from the comfortable quest to destroy evil to a more ambiguous nature.We're just not in sensitive hands here. Because we're not, the sense of lurid spectacle spills over the entire thing: from Lecter's prison block that looks like a medieval dungeon, to the extended crosscutting between houses in the finale that sensationalizes the bleeding obvious.It's sophisticated and heartfelt on Clarice's end of investigating herself, but on the other end it's a silly potboiler that looks like a Texas Massacre sequel. It captivates but it doesn't deepen.


                
Silence of the Lambs is one of the most gripping and chilling crime-thrillers ever made and is based on the critically acclaimed bestseller by Thomas Harris. The movie deserved its five Oscar wins. The genre does not get much better than this.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is a young and attractive FBI trainee. She is called on an "interesting errand" by director Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to try to make a profile of Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), an imprisoned and insane former forensic psychiatrist. There is also a killer on the loose who kidnaps and skins young women, known as "Buffalo Bill"/ Jame Gumb (Ted Levine). Hannibal Lecter offers to help capture him before he kills again.Hannibal Lecter is simply one of the most unforgettable villains in history. Hopkins's portrayal chilled many audiences (including my mother lol) and became a phenomenon. Hopkins deserved more recognition than an Oscar! Jodie Foster was great for the part. She also deserved her Oscar. Her and Hopkins make a good acting duo.Ted Levine was creepy as Jame Gumb. His accent made me crack up sometimes. He portrays the homicidal maniac to a horrifically authentic degree. I can hardly stand to watch in his little "dance sequence". The characters all together are simply unforgettable.As the case with most of the Hannibal Lecter movies (with the exception of "Manhunter), "Silence of the Lambs" sticks close to the book. The book and the film both can't be compared to other books and films of the genre. I think most if not all audiences will be pleased.8/10
This is the first Hannibal Lector movie that I have seen and the most well received, I personally liked it. I mean I don't think it's as good as everybody is saying but at the same time it wasn't bad.The plot of this movie is that an FBI Agent trainee is asked to track down a serial killer by talking to someone who thinks like serial killers and is one. Dr Hannibal Lector or "Hannibal the Cannibal". They are investigating the "Buffalo Bill" murders where a serial killer goes after fat women in order to make a woman-dress.I personally think that Anthony Hopkins did a great job as Hannibal, my only complaint with his performance is that he does throw subtlety out the window quite a bit in this movie. I also felt that Jodie Foster's performance was overrated, but still good. For a fact most of the acting in this movie is well done.So if you want to sit down and watch this movie then this is worth a look. I don't think it is deserving of the praise it got but at the same time it is a decent little watch.


                
"I dwelt alone in a world of moan, my soul a stagnant tide." – Edgar Allan Poe Would "The Silence of the Lambs" work as well as it does if actress Jodie Foster weren't an in-the-closet lesbian? Consider this: the entire film is about being uncomfortable in one's skin. Buffalo Bill, the serial killer at the heart of the picture, has sexual identity issues and hopes to build himself a woman's body. Scorned by the world, Bill kills his victims and strips them of their skin, his aim being to knit himself a "body suit" so that he may "blossom" and "become a more beautiful person".Likewise, Foster's character, a young FBI agent tasked with finding Buffalo Bill, is constantly placed in positions in which she is chided, belittled and insulted. Taunted for her cheap perfume, her "white trash" roots, her lowly status, she's constantly being intimidated by men (inmates, police, prison wardens etc), sees her commander as a sexual threat, and seems to have entered the FBI in order to redeem her father, a modest cop shot on duty.Foster's performance throughout the film (at the time, she was known for a slew of androgynous roles) is itself incredibly fragile, masking insecurity and uncertainty behind a facade of toughness. Because her character is so delicate, we the audience become almost protective of her. We watch as she fights her way through a variety of ominous situations and breath a sigh of relief when she eventually emerges victorious, blossoming into the beautiful flower (a promotion to FBI Special Agent) that the deranged Buffalo Bill is denied. Foster may not end the film feeling entirely comfortable in her own skin, but she's proved to herself that she can survive within her body. She can be herself - somewhat - and win.Director Jonathan Demme's follow up film was "Philadelphia", a film which revolved around a gay character, so it's possible that "Silence's" homosexual subtext - if any - was deliberately nudged by him. Regardless, Demme's direction is remarkable throughout the picture. Watch how he milks every scene, every sequence hyped or taken to incredibly dramatic lengths. Foster's visit to Hannibal Lecter (a cannibal who lives in a maximum security prison), for example, takes us down endless flights of stairs, each level heralded by ominous dialogue, a prison warden even pausing to show Foster a photograph of Lecter's mutilated victims. But importantly, while characters in the film flinch in horror at the image on this photograph, the photograph itself is never actually revealed to Demme's audience. This happens throughout the film: horrors are talked about, emphasised, hyped, our appetite whetted at every turn, but never actually revealed. Here is a film which respects our imagination and treats the macabre with a certain amount of apprehension. Even the film's ending, in which an escaped Hannibal Lectre walks confidently off into the horizon, is the kind of dramatic tease-climax more common in super hero movies. Whilst most horror movies are a series of carefully set up orgasms, "Silence" is all anticipation.With the publication of "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", horror maestro Edgar Allen Poe became the father of detective fiction. But what's interesting is that with this book we see that crime fiction was born within the horror genre. More specifically, from the very start, the criminal has been (wrongly) treated as a vaguely supernatural being; an incomprehensible, alien and irrational monster."Lambs" raked in zillions of dollars, and so kicked off a chain of copycat movies. Post "Lambs" we thus had such films as "Kiss The Girls", "Along Came A Spider", "Taking Lives", "The X Files", "Seven", "Zodiac", "The Cell", "The Bone Collector" etc etc, all of which copied "Lamb's" formula, all of which hoped to cash in on its success. The film also spewed the "wrong house cliché", the "he's in the elevator cliché" and numerous others, before the series, with "Hannibal" and "Red Dragon", degenerated into a silly franchise (the same fate befell "Jaws", "Halloween", "Psycho", "Alien", "Friday the 13th", "Elm Street", "Poltergeist" and "The Exorcist"). In a way, the fact that these franchises and sequels were even possible, highlights the faintly "supernatural" roots of such monsters. The vengeful sharks, serial-killers, aliens, demons and slashers come back to haunt their audiences, not because they can never be killed, but because they aren't remotely "realistic" in the first place (and, of course, because profits necessitate their reappearance).8.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings. See "The Pledge" and "Memories of Murder".
With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre. It is a first- rate production all around. It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme. Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home. The two lead actors won Oscars for their performances...each deserved. Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer. Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation. He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed. The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins. Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well. A quality film in all aspects!


                
This film is a perfectly pleasant way to spend an raining afternoon. The film is engaging and fills the viewer with the requisite dread. Hannibal is a great monster. He conforms perfectly to the antihero archetype as he typifies the best qualities of humanity gone disastrously wrong. Hopkins chews scenery with the best of them. Clarice, especially in Foster's hands, is a strong character with buried psychological trauma that is fighting to get out. The interplay the two characters stands apart from the rest of the film.Part of the reason for that is the rest of it so much worse than the leads. Of note, Buffalo Bill's villainy is steeped in lazy cultural tropes. The screenplay bothering to distinguish between Bill and a "real" transsexual does not make it any less lazy to othering a male villain by feminizing him. The bread crumbs of the mystery are likewise rote and basic. A moth is used as a symbol of transformation! Riveting! LAMBS!This is genre film that has been treated way too seriously. This is something of a bad joke.


                
Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of a sociopath is simply chilling.Having met a real sociopath at a chance encounter, I would give Anthony Hopkins an 8. Real sociopaths are a lot more dramatic and theatrical. They have an inflated ego and enjoy being in control. Fear is never an option and they take delight in manipulation. Anthony's character is everything about a real sociopath minus the theatrics. Instead he delivers subtlety and leaves the audience wanting more of this menacing character. Great storyline with great actors. A classic thriller.


                
The extent of my viewing of the horror/scary film genre consists of Halloween and the Scream Series. I admit it I scare too easily. The 1990 critical and commercial success Silence of the Lambs was never a film I even considered viewing. However, after sweeping the top categories at the 1991 Academy Award (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor and Actress) I admit I had to reevaluate. Still an actual viewing of the film did not occur until after 2000. Yes, I was scared, and slightly horrified, yet completely captivated by the superior filmmaking. This film is a tour de force. Anthony Hopkins embodies the character of Hannibal Lecter to perfection, each syllable spoken with intent and hidden meanings. A monster, yes, but a brilliant one. In later films his Hannibal becomes almost a cartoon of the original, but in the beginning this man could send chills up and down your spine. Jodie Foster finds the perfect balance of innocence and steel determination trying to impress her superiors, but also following her gut instinct. Throughout you can feel her struggle to be accepted is what motivates her though never spoken it is apparent through her true skill as an actress. There are no dull moments this film keeps moving, not letting the viewer become restless and feel ahead of the story. There are displays of horror, blood, violence and true moments of tension, but they are not included for shock value, but integral to the mood the film creates. Every viewing I find something new to be intrigued by, whether it be a camera angle or a supporting player I hadn't paid much attention to in the past. This is a true classic.


                
I'm definitely a fan of horror films and films of most types and I certainly love movies such as the Shining and I thought that this film would greatly entertain me as Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal is like the Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence. I must say the film is definitely very good, but I cannot quite understand why its regarded as so good. It definitely was a good mystery film and the acting by Anthony Hopkins was breathtaking and it pretty much kept the whole movie going nicely. Judie Foster was also brilliant in this film and these two are the stand outs. However, what I like about this film is that there are two completely different villains in the film and of course Hannibal stands out! The score by Howard Shore is great, as usual and the cinematography and special effects are great for a 1991 film. ***SPOILERS*** The scene where Hannibal is served dinner in his cell and he kills the two officers was absolutely awesome and to me, that was the moment of the movie. When we see the "dying" police officer inside the ambulance and he stands up and removes his face and it turns out to be Hannibal, that was the other standout of the film. The end of the film with Hannibal Lector calling Clarice and saying that he has an old friend to catch up with, whilst following Dr Chilton was a great and suspenseful ending to the film as the mainly focused villain throughout the movie was Buffalo Bill. This ending pretty much reminded us that Hannibal was also a bad guy. ***END OF SPOILERS***I, however wish that instead of Buffalo Bill being the main villain, it was Hannibal as the film would've been more entertaining and suspenseful that way.Overall, I certainly enjoyed the film but cannot understand why this film is so highly praised and has won 5 Oscars.
I remeber seeing this movie when I was 9 and being scarred senseless. Lambs is in my top ten of horror movies of all time and as a film student I think I know film. Hopkins and Foster are superb and the camera work and cinematography are amazing. I can't wait to see Red Dragon( the remake of Manhunter) this summer with another appearance from the Cannibal.


                
Heaps of praise have been given to this multiple Oscar winner by Critics and Fans alike. It is sometimes disturbing, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes the Characters are engaging. Sometimes.The Film is inconsistent in both style and substance. There are way too many close ups. After a few, the intended uneasiness is lost. Most of the sets are attractively unappealing and does give the sense of a forbidden place. A striking performance from Hopkins but some of his cryptic inclusions using anagrams are uninteresting and at worst confusing and make no or little sense of irony. Jodie Foster seems forcing it, especially when asked to reveal some secret recalling the title of the Book and Movie. There are also some less than brilliantly enticing lectures from Hannibal about coveting and a scribbled note that is laughably sophomoric and we're off to catch the truly creepy Buffalo Bill.Overall it adds up to be less than it seems. Some clever stuff but it is carelessly sewed together and with some tugging starts to unravel. Overrated, but influential, with some disturbing and dank scenes that make this a bumpy, irritating, and not quite completely satisfying ride to the Dark Side.


                
Silence of the Lambs is a movie about the madness and the psychic.This is its greatness.I have watched Red Dragon and Hanibal before Silence of the Lambs and i knew that it won't be better than Red Dragon but it will be much better than Hanibal and i was right.This is the oldest movie of the trilogy but it is a sequel of Red Dragon which was released in 2002.Now about Silence of the Lambs.The plot is about an FBI agent who must reveal the secret of Buffalo Bill-crazy psychopath who is doing weird things with his victims.Her name is Clarice Starling.She finds that Dr.Hanibal Lecter can help her with this case.Hanibal is played by Anthony Hopkins and he is the best thing in this movie.Really his greatest performance.The proviso is that he will tell Clarice about Bufallo Bill and his secrets,only if she tells him about her personal live.Her tragedy is that her father has died when she was young.This is about the plot.Very original idea for recreation of the life of an FBI agent fighting against pure and simple Madness.


                
Jodie Foster, in a fine performance, is FBI-trainee Clarice Starling. She is assigned by the chief of the Behavioral Sciences Division (Scott Glenn) to interview the brilliant and cannibalistic mad psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison and try to enlist his help in capturing a currently active serial murderer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who skins his victims and sews the patches of skin into a kind of integumental suit made of women.When Starling first visits Lecter, the chief psychiatrist ( the eminently hatable Anthony Heald) escorts her down into the bowels of the institution and cautions her about approaching Lecter too closely, although they will be separated by a wall of bullet-proof plastic.Lecter DOES in fact help her. Buffalo Bill had once been a patient of his. But Lecter wants something too, in return. "Quid pro quo," he tells her, showing off his Latin clichés. For every hint he gives to her and to the FBI, he demands some sort of present, such as a room with a view and, most important, some personal details about Starling's earlier life, the events in her past that brought her from a one-horse town in Appalachia to the FBI. He gets it. And she gets Buffalo Bill. And Lecter escapes in order to carry on his own cannibalistic career, beginning with the eminently hatable Anthony Heald. (His last line: "I'm having an old friend for dinner tonight.") It doesn't sound too promising, does it? Still ANOTHER serial killer on the loose? With a puzzling modus operandi? Which the FBI must figure out in order to track him down and shoot him dead? But I described this as an effective thriller, not an ordinary one that serves as one more opportunity for Stallone to strip off his clothes and bulge his muscles at the camera. It's functionally directed by Jonathan Demme, based on Thomas Harris's novel. Only one incident involves a stunt man. There isn't a car chase in sight, nor an exploding fireball, nor a slow-motion shot of violence. There is one lethal beating and only a single shoot-out -- with pistols, not Uzis or 40 mm. Bofors cannons.The three threads of the story involve Glenn's avuncular relationship with the younger Starling, the flirtation (for that's what it amounts to) between Lecter and Starling, and the pursuit of the twisted Buffalo Bill. The stories mesh very well, and one scene in particular, linking the FBI's attack on a suspect's house to Starling's casual and apparently post-climactic ringing the doorbell of a house belonging to an old lady, is masterfully done.Tak Fujimoto's camera work could hardly be improved upon. He paints for us a wintry Middle-Atlantic setting with ice-cold rivers and stark, bare deciduous trees. There is a scene with a decomposing corpse that makes your skin crawl, although it is handled matter-of-factly, or even in such good taste as such a scene allows for. Original, too, is the character of Buffalo Bill's last intended victim, a large young lady kept prisoner in a basement pit. With Bill still darting around in the shadows somewhere, the lone Starling yells down to her and tells her she's safe now that the FBI is here. We're wrong if we expect the captive to pull the usual response. She doesn't break down and sob with relief. She screams back, "**** that, you b****! Get me out of here!" It was a nice touch in the novel too, which is written in lean, functional, and artless prose.All of the performances are quite good, with Hopkins outstanding as the crazy genius. The character became something of an icon in vernacular culture, which I guess is why audiences find it satisfying and amusing that he should be left on the loose to kill still more people. It adds a new dimension to films -- the serial killer who deserves to be let free because he's polite and has visited Florence. The writers help bring this story above average. When Foster explores the house of an earlier, almost forgotten victim, there is a touching moment when she discovers some hidden photos the girl had taken of herself posing coyly in her underwear, although she's too plump to be conventionally attractive. A music box plays in the background while Foster goes through these pitiful remnants and we can sense the life behind the death. The direction isn't free of conventions though. Foster is blinded in darkness and the murder's hand reaches out from behind the camera and traces her contours without touching them. Every horror movie must have such a scene. And earlier, when Scott Glenn realizes he's sent Foster into a dangerous, potentially lethal circumstance without any warning, the camera moves in quickly to a close up of his startled expression as he says, "Clarice!" These clichés are available in finer B-grade slasher movies everywhere.The conventions are aptly deployed though and the movie succeeds in what it's trying to do.
"The Silence of the Lambs" is a thriller and I am not a big thriller's fan, I like, but no more and this movie does not unfortunately derogate from the rule. Despite a very convincing and masterful Anthony Hopkins in the role of a Hannibal Lecter that we only see twenty minutes but which marks us, being fascinating while keeping a very disturbing side that defines well Hannibal Lecter but it must be said, Jody Foster in the role of Clarice Starling is also very good. Unfortunately I did not really get into the film, a shady atmosphere but that did not affect me more than that and scenes of Lecter can be too made to be "shock" and not psychological enough for my taste. However it remains for me a good movie and a cult movie that I will see again in a few years, with the hope of succeeding in entering this film which is worth only a 7/10 for me today. Maybe I'll love it in few years!
Film is basically divided, unevenly, into three sections: Starling interviewing Lector, for clues about the identity of a killer at large, referred to as Buffalo Bill; Lector's manipulation of Starling, in attempt to escape custody; and the case of Buffalo Bill himself, a truly frightening villain, moreso than Lector himself, in my opinion.Buffalo Bill holding the girl captive in the well in his basement are terrifying, especially when he speaks to her, referring to her as *it*. "It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does that whenever it is told", in such a booming, baritone voice, only makes it sound even more intimidating. He is one of the creepiest killers in film, vaguely similar to Leatherface, and leaves quite an impression, despite precious little screen time. I found him to be more intimidating and terrifying even than Lector, who, while also chilling, was more of a gentleman in his speech and mannerisms. Even when Lector was beating the guard with his nightstick, he did it with such elegance and finesse, he made it seem almost poetic. A counter to Buffalo Bill's crudity.The climax was taut and suspenseful, as Starling gropes around in the pitch black basement searching for Buffalo Bill, a light, and a way out, but it was negated when he committed such an obvious, stupid mistake (loudly pulling the hammer back on his gun, and basically announcing his presence to Starling) Or, was that the purpose of that action, to show us he really wasn't a very smart man?
I have often considered this movie (and the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster) to be over rated. I didn't like it upon release, and I found myself bored when I revisited it several years later. However I recently got in to a debate with a friend when I said Robin Williams should have won the Oscar for "Fisher King", and either Susan Surrandon or Geena Davis should have won for "Thelma & Louise" over Hopkins and Foster in this movie, and he disagreed strongly suggesting I Rewatch this asap. So here we go.Plot in A Paragraph: Clarice Starling (Foster) a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter (Hopkins) to apprehend another serial killer, known only as "Buffalo Bill".Don't get me wrong, both Hopkins and Foster are very good here, I just find the movie routine and their performances over rated. They do have really good chemistry, but only share four scenes throughout the course of the film, with Hopkins only appearing in about 20-25 minutes of the movie. Scott Glenn and Charles Napier give solid support in smaller roles. "Silence Of The Lambs" was only the third film, the other two being It Happened One Night and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay. It is also the first Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror film.


                
In this multiple Oscar-winning thriller, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy whose shrewd analyses of serial killers lands her a special assignment: the FBI is investigating a vicious murderer nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kills young women and then removes the skin from their bodies. Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into this case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out. Lecter does indeed know something of Buffalo Bill, but his information comes with a price: in exchange for telling what he knows, he wants to be housed in a more comfortable facility. More important, he wants to speak with Clarice about her past. He skillfully digs into her psyche, forcing her to reveal her innermost traumas and putting her in a position of vulnerability when she can least afford to be weak. The film mingles the horrors of criminal acts with the psychological horrors of Lecter's slow-motion interrogation of Clarice and of her memories that emerge from it
Decent horror/thriller movie. I felt the use of an insane criminal to find another criminal was a clever plot device. I think there could have been more twists and turns overall in the movie with this, though.Of course, Hannibal's acting was great and one of the great things about the movie. The characterization of the main character was a bit lacking, and though it was touched upon a few times, it was never fully developed, and thus didn't live up to its true potential by showing her inner strife and history.Finally, the ending was perfect, as one criminal was caught and the other free. This was a proper ending for Hannibal and I felt there would have been no other good way to tie up the endings of the movie.
When this movie came out, I was just a kid, so it wasn't till years later that I saw it. I liked it, but didn't understand what the fuss was about. I found it quite lacking in many aspects, especially Jodie Foster's acting, which reminds me of a bad soap opera. I, simply, found that the movie was missing a lot of things.Then, a few years later, I read the book and saw just how much the movie missed, mostly in character portrayal. The only person who, actually, did the role right, was Scott Glenn, but it was never explained why he was always so sad and melancholic (his wife's illness and death).Ted Levine was also pretty good, I liked the way he played a psycho, especially since I've seen some of his more uptight and comic roles, eg., in Monk.As far as Hopkins goes, I think that Lecter suited him better in Hannibal and Red dragon. It seemed that he was so relaxed in the role. In this movie, not so much, but I don't think it was really his fault, being a truly great actor. Like I said, the overall character portrayal was bad.I, actually, don't like Jodie Foster that much, and her whiny Clarice is not much different from, say, Nell.Demme did capture the gruesome atmosphere really well and I have to give him that.Even though it is a good movie, it is not a great one and I certainly hope someone decides to do the book a little more justice some day.
I saw this one at the cinema and came out wondering what all the fuss was about. It was reasonably entertaining but annoying at the same time. I like Anthony Hopkins as an actor but he was hamming it up as Lecter and made the charcter look cartoonish rather than scary. Jodie Foster gave a good impression of a woman trying to reverse out of a parking space.
What surpised me most about this film was that it won several Oscars including best film. It's obvious to me now that the people at the Academy know less about film than most five year olds. Remember when Kramer v Kramer won best film, that was the year Apocalypse Now was released and who can remember the former?I've learned my lesson since then and have avoided Oscar winners such as Titanic and The English Patient. Silence of the Lambs is an above average thriller but no work of art. The plot is also absurd and goes for cheap thrills with the usual gore and when Buffalo Bill gets his kit off you simply have to yawn, it didn't shock me. As for his victim in the pit, somehow you just wish Bill would end it for the poor girl and the suffering audience. In summary! Not as good as Manhunter and not the best of Hopkins! 7/10
