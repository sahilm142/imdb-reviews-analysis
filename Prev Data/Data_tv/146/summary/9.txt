 One of the most successful series I've seen in recent years!

 Dark, gritty and interesting.

 Not so much "Stranger Things". more "Twin Peaks".

 Dark.. thrilling and haunting

 Warning! - your mind may not process this TV series - might be fried in the end.

 Dark is Science Fiction in the David Lynch Mode

 Darker Things

 My head hurts

 An interesting psychological mystery thriller

 Live Action Steins Gate

 I wish I could travel to 2018 to watch Season 2

 Spellcasting serial

 Slow-burning, interesting and intelligent - Dark is MY kind of TV Series

 A suspenseful and atmospheric TV Show that requires your undivided attention.

 Excellent Conundrum for Mature Audiences

 Stunning direction nd music..full of mystery...

 .

 Incredible Just Incredible

 It's Creepy, It's Mind Blowing, It's Dark

 Spine-tingling, gripping and one of the best takes on Time Warp.

 LOST Vibes

 Dark, Intense, Thrilling

 They say it is Stranger Things alike, But this one's more darker and quite interesting

 And as it tis above, so below...

 Greatest series of 2017
