I believe that those over 35 might enjoy Diabolique. It does start off slowly, but I believe that this helps the audience to appreciate the motive to make the headmaster disappear. The director did pick up the pace after the first 23 minutes of film. I found this movie to be more suspenseful than horror-like. I believe that the movie is in French so you get a chance to freshen up on your understanding. It does have English subtitles so that we can all understand all that is taking place. I find it difficult to watch both the English subtitles and watch the film. I am sure that if I did not have to struggle with both that I would have rated the movie a bit higher. This is a popcorn cruncher instead of a popcorn muncher (more relaxed) due to suspense. Three thumbs up.
