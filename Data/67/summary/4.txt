 Tries to do too much, accomplishes very little. A disappointment...

 Truly disappointing!

 Fails to Rise to the occasion

 New Title: The Dark Knight Reaks!!!

 This film is carried by its predecessors

 Jesus..

 The Dark Knight Trudges On Interminably

 A worthy ending to an amazing series...

 Not that good as you think part 3

 Disappointing

 Worse than Prometheus...seriously

 The review you need, not the one you deserve!

 Batman didn't rise.

 Dark Knight Fails....

 From the Joker, to a Joke

 SUCH a BIG disappointment!!! NEVER again...

 This movie for me did not even come close to the TDK or Batman Begins

 Sadly Overrated

 A new perspective

 Good but not the best.

 Loved the first, liked the second, cared not for the third.

 Good, but out of this world? I think not...

 Unreal

 A train wreck

 Underwhelming
