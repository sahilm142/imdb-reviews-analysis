 The most uncompromising studio picture of the 1990s.

 An underrated and undervalued Scorsese Classic

 "Now it looks like Disney Land"

 A Can't-Miss Story No Matter How Told

 Fantastic Film

 I never knew Sharon Stone was so talented

 Scorsese ,Deniro &Pesci deliver again

 Brilliant acting. Superb story based on events that happened in real life.

 I Know I Am In The Minority When I Say This Was Much Better Than Goodfellas.

 Perhaps The Best Gangster Film I've Seen

 Terrific. Underrated.

 How Others See Us

 Feels short for a 3-hour movie...

 Scorsese strikes again with this must-see classic.

 The perfect picture of Las Vegas early days.

 The Story Behind Las Vegas

 Greatest Movie of the Genre

 "Hey, better here than, uh, up there, y'know what I mean?"

 An allegory for the way the world is run .....

 Spine Chilling. Blew me away

 The Bret hart of movies

 A Classic Martin Scorsese Movie!

 On a par with Goodfellas in my opinion

 No Gamble Needed, Casino Wins the Bet of Favorite Scorsese Picture

 Casino,,, vegas style
