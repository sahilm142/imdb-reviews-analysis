Donald Glovers metaphors are so on the nose it hurts. Two examples straight away from the show. 1. When the mom is shouting at her kid for copying paper boy but as soon as she sees paper boy she gets all hyped and asks for a picture completely forgetting everything she said to her kid moments earlier. Ooh we get it, society worships celebrities at the expense of morals. 2. When Glovers character is the only one concerned about the mentally ill guy in the jail who everyone else laughs at then gets beaten up by the sheriff. 'Look at me caring for the mentally ill people thrown in jail!!' You can say your message about social issues without being so hamfisted about it. As for the rest of the show there's nothing particularly interesting or noteworthy about it. It's not very funny and it doesn't talk about life in Atlanta in an interesting way.


                
There a lot of paid reviewers for this show. The song she'll if your mindless and have no sense of humor. Save your time.
