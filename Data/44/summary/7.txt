 Intense But The Hype And Awards Possibly Work Against It

 A music themed sports movie that dissolves like toilet paper with a little thought

 Drumming to the utmost.

 good job..

 Disturbing but definitely worth seeing.

 Whiplash Just Might Be One Of The Greats

 How Far Can You Go To Be Perfect?

 Complete garbage.

 Overrated, Overpraised, and Over the Top

 Powerful--and thin, and the "jazz" is handcuffed "band" music

 A musical thriller. Intense,vicious and cruel. But with damn lot of rhythm in it.

 Like my old gym school teacher

 Gran película

 What am I missing?

 The Full Metal Jacket of Drumming Films !!!

 A different kind of beat

 It doesn't rush and it definitely doesn't drag.

 Magical

 A movie all about music for those that understand it

 Unrealistic, unapologetic, and absolutely entrancing

 «The road to greatness can take you to the edge»

 Moving, captivating film

 Obsessive and Vigorous

 Satisfying on a visceral level, but overcooked and conceptually absurd

 Unrealistic but worth watching
