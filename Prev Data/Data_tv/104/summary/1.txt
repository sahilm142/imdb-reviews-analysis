 Dreadful episode two

 Simply irritating

 Boring,long winded, same gags

 Embarrassingly awful

 Not the same..

 Grand Tour's "The American" driver is an insult to US fans

 Love Hate

 Waiting like an hour for a good joke...

 Plain, Boring, Awful - Still in Season 3

 The Grand Boredom

 I never do reviews but..........

 Grand Tour, more like a grand mess

 boring, scripted, no progress, no compare with old TG

 Absolute Shite

 What is this?

 Omg god give me mercy oh my lord what an utter piece of crap

 Money can't buy inspiration

 feels like a sequel of a bad movie

 How the hell has this rubbish got 9/10

 3 annoying ignorant right wingers and maybe a car

 Gone downhill

 This is lame

 Getting more lame

 It's gotten painful to watch

 It is becoming more stupid and more of the same thing with each episode
