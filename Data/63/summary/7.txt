 Creative Vision with Predictable Plot = Not Entirely Satisfying

 Good but not great, despite some wonderful pieces

 Very Disappointing

 Overrated

 Worth watching, especially for the short!!

 Jam-packed with plot and viewer-friendly ecology-minded messages...perhaps too jammed

 Not Pixar's best, by any stretch of the imagination

 An innocent little robot begins to have feelings for a robot named EVE.

 I got bored and I felt no magic

 A refreshing surprise

 Difficult to review

 Wow, do I feel out of step!

 Good movie but not as good as what others have rated.

 Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?

 Go see Kung Fu Panda, it is better.

 Very Cute, Lots of Fun, But Feels So Empty

 robotic emotions

 Not Bad, not that great.

 Lovable little robot but lost a little interest towards the end

 It was...OK....

 Disappointing

 certainly not garbage

 A would-be great film ruined by the unsubtle sociopolitical sledgehammer message in a G-RATED film

 Wall-E: Rise of the Machines

 Good movie from Pixar, but not a 9 out of 10
