 A good movie, but not a great movie

 My review

 Good Music....Good Star Cast...But very overrated..

 The Ultimate Slice Of Culturally Significant Pop-Culture. "Pulp Fiction" Is A Morality Piece Beyond Anything You've Ever Seen

 At least the Emperor is wearing underpants

 Oscillating Wildly

 Not a big fan of this acclaimed film

 Zzzzzzzzzzz...

 Overrated

 Kinetic and sneaky, narcotizing and primal...

 filled with star making performances

 An enjoyable noir story

 Pulp Fiction

 Great movies, Must watch.

 A Bit Over Rated But Good

 Has become a classic.

 Good movie, but violent

 Interesting film

 Variations on a theme ...

 Mediocre

 I may have to just get used to Tarantino before I like this movie as much as others

 I'm no movie critic

 Pulp Fiction (1994)

 Very Nice!

 Profanity, violence, and pop culture references abound in PULP FICTION
