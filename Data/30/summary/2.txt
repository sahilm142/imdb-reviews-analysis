 How is this on the top 250?

 Bad script, over acting, and lacks of anything good, except the cast.

 Ludicrous & ridiculous effort from Besson

 Why is this movie considered good? it's just ridiculous!

 What's wrong with these action geeks?

 Nikita + Pretty baby = What a let-down!

 noxious and twee

 come on!!!!!

 could not buy it

 Average Action Drama

 painfully slow with stilted dialogue

 Bad or Worse?
