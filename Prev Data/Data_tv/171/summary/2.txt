 Overhyped

 Insanely overrated

 Another "politically correct" series

 Started good and had no where to go but way down

 "Vikings"

 Model girls taming men outdoors

 Christian status quo propaganda

 Unspeakably Abysmal

 Good start, terrible after season 2!

 Characters and unreal battles killed it for me.

 Good Fantasy, Horrible History

 where to start with what's wrong with this show?

 No matter how bad we want it to be good - Vikings sucks.

 For the only Viking show around, it's watchable

 Does not live up to the hype.
