 The Marine's don't want robots-they want killers.

 Like all Kubrick films it requires multiple viewings

 That Giant Sucking Sound

 Foul-mouthed, gruelling snapshot of Vietnam.... intentionally unpretty and bleak (which is, ironically, both its strength and its weakness).

 Good Movie, but far from the best war movie ever

 A Film Of Two Halves

 Not Up To Kubrick's Usual Brilliance

 This is two films...

 R. Lee Ermey.

 A Been-There-Done-That War Film

 A fine war film, although not without considerable flaws. An assortment of various ideas that never really form together in perfect harmony.

 Kubrick's patchwork of war

 Good war film!

 Nothing new, but well done

 Thought Provoking

 Full Metal Jacket - Great first act, disappointing second

 Two movies in one

 One half of a great movie.

 Leave after boot camp

 First half much better than second

 The movie was better before it got to Vietnam

 Great film in terms of filming skill

 A great film from a great director

 Oh my God

 Some bits of dialog bothered me.
