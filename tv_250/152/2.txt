I have never before gone from loving a show to so completely hating it. After the first 3 seasons I was really looking forward to season 4. After season 4 I was disappointed but then I thought - everyone's entitled to an off show or an off season. So when season 5 came along I thought that I would give Louie another chance. But after watching season 5 episode 1 I am done with Louie. Firstly this is not a comedy - that's okay but people should know that going in. It's not only not a comedy it's downright depressing. Every episode seems to be an excuse to portray how twisted Louie's experience with other people, especially women is. There is not one likable character in Louie including Louie himself. They're not even particularly interesting people because I simply can't relate to these repressed, narcissistic New Yorkers. And this is all coming from a guy who loves Louis CK's stand up, his interviews on Stern and the first 3 seasons of Louie. I would watch S5E2 but I have no hope that this gets any better and I just can't bear the thought of spending 22 more minutes inside Louie's sick, sad mind.


                
Unfortunately, this is not a good TV show. After reading all that positive reviews I gave it a chance. It turns out that it was total waste of my time. The show has lack of action, it is little bit boring and humor is too, way too black and inappropriate. In the end, what is the most important, it is not funny. I have watched first four episodes and I was smiling just once (in the first one). The show has been compared with Curb your enthusiasm. I must say that this kind of black humor really does remind to that specific TV show. But, I did not like that show either.Finally, my advice is for you to keep searching for something else.
