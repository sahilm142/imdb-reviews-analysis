 Heavy on Atmosphere / Light on Substance

 Wow, 8,4... Really?!?

 Some of the WORST writing and acting in the history of television

 Terribly Unjust

 Overrated

 It's just yet another show for 14 year old kids with no brain

 big disappointment

 Very bad!

 am I watching the same show as you guys

 Mads Mikkelsen is an embarrassment

 Hannibal is a total abomination & should not be aired

 NBC sure does have it's shills out on full force

 Don't Waste your time

 The single worst/most pathetic excuse for a television series i've EVER had the misfortune of watching

 Coo Coo for Cocoa Puffs!

 Troubled FBI Guy needs a punch

 pretentious garbage

 Dumbibal

 A circus or a freaks show full of blood , blood and more of blood!!

 Tasteless, odorless, not fat, not salty nonsense.

 Season 1, episode 3
