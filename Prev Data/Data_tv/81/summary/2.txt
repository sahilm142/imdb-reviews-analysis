 Slow ...

 Pretentious artists are their own worst enemies

 waaay over rated

 I Don't Understand All This Positive Hype

 Who likes this tedious stuff?

 Horribly slow and boring. No relationship with Breaking Bad

 Extremely disappointing spin off from Breaking Bad

 The season final sucks !

 Season 4 stinks!

 Disappointed

 A show about nothing

 Seems to be getting worse

 The more you watch, the more you like it

 better call slow??

 No worries, you can't pen a spoiler-review for a show this bad.

 Season 4 review

 Season 3 is extremely boring.

 I really want to like it but so far it's pretty bad

 No one cares about Chuck
