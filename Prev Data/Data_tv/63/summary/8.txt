 The Simpsons rules!!! (episode spoilers)

 A brilliant show originally, but is gradually getting worse...

 Honestly it's overrated...

 Epic and memorable but also a terrible sellout

 The Simpsons make life worth living

 May it never end

 Awesome

 We deserve better

 Started very well, but tries too hard to emulate its classic appeal.

 The Simpsons Is A Good Show But Primarily For Adults

 Best show ,entertainer , best Animation & of course a lot FUN

 Originally, Best T.V. Show Ever, But Now Slipping

 The show I have been watching all my life.

 America's most wackiest family

 Great at it's beginning, now barely watchable

 Why The Simpsons are still on TV

 Growing up Simpson

 Once upon a time....

 Infinitely short of being spot-on

 I love the Simpsons but it's time to put this show to rest

 My childhood and counting
