 Thank god I decided to give this a chance

 All seasons are awesome.

 This show has filled the Breaking Bad gap in my heart.

 Better Call Saul challenges 'spin-off' title

 Amazing, takes the best things from Breaking Bad and adds comedy

 The perfect balance

 This soared way past my already high expectations as a hardcore Breaking Bad fan

 Gilligan and Gould do it again !!!

 Anticipation was Well worth the Wait

 Better Call Saul Looks Like Another Hit !

 It's All Good, Man: Post S4 Review

 Better Call Saul has been renewed for Season 5!. Hallelujah.

 If you have depth... you'll find this show extraordinary.

 Character driven excellence

 Another story of transformation, from Jimmy McGill to Saul Goodman, and it works

 This is a 5 course meal type show

 What a show!

 In a way, even better than Breaking Bad was.

 Odyssey vs Iliad

 I'm a lawyer, not a criminal.

 They've captured something powerful here

 Thank you for being so awesome

 Wow Episode 3 was a masterpiece
