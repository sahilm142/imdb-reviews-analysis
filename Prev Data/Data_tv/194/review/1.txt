I share to god any comedy show that is a cartoon is just so funny it ever one. People wake up this show is not funny it is gross and stupid. The story lines are awful. The acting it not to good either.


                
this show is what i like to call a desperate attempt at trying to put up another cash cow (wich seems succeeded) the characters are boring don't show any development the jokes are predictable and the standard dumb guy that every group has is just done to death. bender is just your basic good/bad guy that sometimes seems a good guy but really isn't. Leela is overly manly and doesn't show any signs of interest (besides her voice actor is great) Hermes is not even a character to my beliefs just some sassy guy without an opinion of his own. the professor is a plain old man with weird and stupid ambitions that don't ever seem interesting. the list goes on and on this show gets the stamp of animated crap that this show gets such a high rate on this website is really puzzling to me


                
i hate this programme so much its so not funny i hate fry Leela simpsons is brilliant futurearna is not i hate the robot. my mums boyfriend loves it i hate watching it it has to be the worst programme ever all the characters are one dimensional i have genuinely laughed one time while watching it once other than that its just not funny only cartoon i hate its awful. i don't see why people like it so much its just stupid i find the game better than the TV series i really why do people like it so much why oh why do people like this i love the simpsons love it hate this programme though i cant believe this has to be 10 lines long not much i can think to say about this stupid programme its awful it really is 8.0 really its not an 8.0 its not even a 5.0 its crap south park now that is funny. What i hate about futurarma is the overacting in it its annoying and the way they make stuff seem dramatic and cool is annoying
