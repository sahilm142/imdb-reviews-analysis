 Superficial action movie that lacks depth

 visually beautiful but Boring action-action-action-no story movie

 Very disappointing...

 Really? Is this where we are heading?

 This isn't a Mad Max film - and it gets boring

 Are IMDb selling positive votes?

 so over-rated

 massively over-rated

 Must be a lot of people from the film bumping the numbers

 Vastly Overrated

 So much disappointment.

 6 Oscars, huh?

 Way too long, way overdone

 did I watch the right movie!!!

 Way overrated!!!

 Highly overrated

 Shallow action without any aesthetics, charm or depth

 Don't get addicted to gasoline because it will ruin your movie

 Epic fail!! Almost..

 Maxed out and running on fumes...

 Bane is back?

 Did Feminist Movement Take a Step Back? Witness Me Suffer

 Road to Despair.

 No depth whatsoever

 Just wondering
