 YOU MANIACS..what have you done to the great show..GOD DAMN YOU...GOD DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL

 Archer is magically raunchy

 What an absolute treat.

 Best Animated TV Comedy

 Brilliant

 Archer is the best animated comedy since South Park, 1st season = awesome

 Cracks me up!

 James Bond, if James Bond Was a Total Douche

 Great Show overall, but loses its touch.

 I love this show

 100% inappropriate....so don't let your kids catch you watching it!

 This sly and knowing series is a pleasure to watch

 Ridiculous, irreverent, and HILARIOUS

 One of the best shows of the post 9/11 era

 Arrrrrrrccccchhhher is ace!

 Archer is a really funny cartoon spy comedy

 Danger Zone!

 laugh out loud, in real life for a change

 Incredibly smart.

 Archer is hilariously awesome!

 Do not be afraid to enter the Danger zone...

 Brilliant show! Worth to make some full length!
