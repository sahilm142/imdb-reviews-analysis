 What am I missing?

 Totally forgettable flick ranging from ridiculous to disgusting

 At best an average soap-opera

 How many tomatoes had to "die" for this dud to be produced ?

 A wannabe "tragedy a la Grecque" with lots of gore and no sublime

 Wow, this movie blows

 Let the viewer beware!

 Why?

 Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie

 8.3? IMDb failed me...

 most overrated movie ever made

 This is a very sick movie!

 Pretentious piece of fail

 I hate this movie more than anyone else

 There was only one good thing about this movie

 Don't waste your time

 A maladjusted, pre-pubescent, repressed schoolboy's wet dream

 More fun watching sticking your head in a toilet to watch the brown submarines

 awful

 proof

 the second half is a betrayal

 Shameful, Shoddy... and a few other words that start with "sh"

 I give up. Trying to show people how cheesy/unoriginal this movie is can't be done.

 Almost as intelligent as Paris Hilton's sex tape

 Really, really, really, really bad.
