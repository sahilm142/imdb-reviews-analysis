 WALL-E Brings Pathos to Computer Animation

 WALL-E: A Wonderful Achievement

 Not 100% Perfect, But One of The Best Films I Have Ever Seen

 The Certainty of Seeing

 Wow !!!

 Absolutely Stunning B-D Visuals & Audio

 Possibly Pixar's Best

 Glorious animation with heart outclasses everything this year.

 I love madly Disney/Pixar

 A highly entertaining, delightful science-fiction film that should not be dismissed as childish animation

 Wall*E Caring for the Disabled; Valuing those with imperfections!

 Pixar's deepest, realistic, and most original masterpiece

 Not just one of the best animated films, but one of the best films of all time

 WALL-E, the most innovative animated film in years...

 Pixar knocks another one out of the park

 Persoanlly romantic picturesque picture

 What a cartoon!

 Damn good.

 Astonishing Animation, Beautiful, Cute with an unusually powerful message

 Simply amazing!

 Thoughtful and Kind

 Even mechanical hearts can love

 Essentially a sweet and very involving robot love story where the two robots have the task of getting humans back to Earth that they've left behind temporarily
