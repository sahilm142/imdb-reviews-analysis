 Are you serious?

 Disappointingly obvious

 The Prestige doesn't work due to acute predictability

 Sci-fi as a deus ex machina?

 Great packaging... but nothing good inside

 The magic isn't there...

 Below par movie from "Memento" creator

 The real mystery is the praise this film received

 Not so much of a magic trick, just a flight of the imagination... maybe.

 Make my money reappear please!

 The Prestige wasn't worth the Pricetag

 Waste of Talent

 Implausible story

 A mess of a movie, in my opinion.

 Bad

 Ending is worse than horrible

 The Prestige vs The Illusionist

 top hat reproduction?

 Confused thriller about two magician's rivalry in Victorian London.
