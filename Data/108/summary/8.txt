 Another Wilder classic

 It's lost a step over time, but still satisfies even if it does not surprise

 "Some people take, some people get took."

 Though the film is Black and White, the moral implications are anything but...

 A sweet romantic comedy masterpiece from Billy Wilder

 Prodding the Plight of the Pushovers

 A classic romantic comedy with depth and drama

 Comedy and Drama in one scoop

 Evidently a classic

 Very well-written, interesting, and funny

 A story about a shy man

 Entertainment with a little edge

 A welcome adult story and engaging characters
