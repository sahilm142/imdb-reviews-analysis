 Bland and empty political commentary with some cool explosions.

 "1984" for Dummies

 Adolescent and boring

 Pulp Political Posturing, Just an Overgrown Comic Book

 V For Vendetta?

 "Bollocks!"

 Good and Bad but overall disappointing

 Political propaganda full of clichés turn out to be a pathetic, mediocre movie

 Completely Misses The Point Of The Source Material

 Terrorism is good

 If you can ignore the kinder-garden level political subtext you can enjoy it

 Well constructed, but completely misses the point.

 Did I miss something?

 Wasted opportunity

 M for Mediocre

 Politically inane, and a bit too much to swallow

 a great movie destroyed by Natalie Portman accent

 Not so very good

 For the lowest common denominator

 Bad and stupid, yet visually beautiful

 Gunpowder Clot

 OK, but not nearly as good as everyone seems to think it is

 Dull Uneventful and Painfully Boring to Watch!

 It's the fear, man!
