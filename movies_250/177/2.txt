The movie tells the tale of two losers who console in each other by means of letters. So far, so good. When I read the synopsis I was convinced that the story was interesting. The movie itself however didn't seem to deliver in that regard. Instead I ended up watching another one of those "too crazy for you"-type of animated movies. Somehow all animated movies these days are pretty much a parody on the eponymous genre itself. All characters are completely over-exaggerated and ridiculous ergo unbelievable. Considering how one of the most important aspects of storytelling is the aspect of believability it's definitely not a good thing in this particular case.
