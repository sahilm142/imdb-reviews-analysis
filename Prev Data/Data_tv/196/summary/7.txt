 Stunning

 Probably wise to end it here, but still massively superior TV

 Didn't think it could get any better... But it has!

 Addictive viewing

 This isn't Hollywood. This Is England.

 A fantastic piece of television.

 Glad it's over, if I'm honest

 Gripping, Emotionally charged and Brilliant!
