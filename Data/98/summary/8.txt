 Warmly prestigious (which is both pro and con)

 Classic movie about a small-town Southern advocate including intense court drama , atmospheric scenarios and superb interpretations

 Great family drama through children's viewpoint

 I'm sorry, it's not really a review.

 A movie that never gets old

 Peculiar but worthy even in 2018

 A very faithful adaptation of the novel.

 Interesting 2 hr and 9 min long movie

 Great watch for all even if it is old.

 It's great.

 To Live and Die in Americana.

 An intriguing slice of Americana from living memory

 Atticus Finch and His Mockingbirds

 My number 145 movie

 Gregory Peck Spot on as Atticus

 To Kill a Mockingbird

 A great adaptation with a few writing flaws.

 Great book and great movie

 Almost as good as the book

 A premium classic

 A well-adapted story about Morality.

 Touching story that will bring you back to the troubles of the time

 Proper representation of the fight for civil rights

 Great subjects presentations and weaving the two of them together

 It's a great film!
