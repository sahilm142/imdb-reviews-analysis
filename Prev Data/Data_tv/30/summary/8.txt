 Genuinely Amazed With the Pilot and What Followed.

 Intriguing and terrifying

 Cold but effective

 superb

 Black Mirror shows you a reflection of the future you didn't want to see, but can't look away from.

 Watch a good show, not this

 Keep Britain British!

 Black Mirror

 Yep, just great

 I was hooked!!

 Uss calister

 Some excellent episodes, some not so much.

 Some episodes convolute too much back-story

 Started solid, losing steam

 A great show that will fly over many heads!

 Endings

 A brief review/critique of my three favorite Episodes.

 Amazing

 Entertaining!

 Good but there should be a warning

 Scars of Techno-paranoia

 Great Beginnings

 I want more episodes!!

 Mirror to other realities

 Refection of the Evil Side of Technology and the Modern World
