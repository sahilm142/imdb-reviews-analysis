No long review...I'm gonna keep this short & sweet. This has got to be one of the worst movies ever! Certainly it ranks up there in one of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners.I simply can't understand the popularity of this movie...It just drags and drags and drags.It literally has one scene in the movie that holds any interest for me and of course that's the classic chariot race scene.If you've never seen this movie but you feel you must, I would advise you to get a DVD & immediately click on the chariot scene. If you do that, you'll have seen the only worthwhile part of this movie.If you want to watch a fun, entertaining biblical epic, check out The Ten Commandments, again with Charlton Heston. It tends to lean toward the campy, actually, but that's really what makes it fun. DeMille wound up making a melodrama on the epic scale instead of a ponderous, deadly slow film like Ben Hur.Ben Hur is one BAD movie and I love movies...have seen thousands and I'm telling you: This is THE WORST!!!!


                
Over the top acting to the extreme, dated costume design, effects work ect... and an absolutely horrid pace. Hands down the worst accepted film ever made, and the fact that it gets so much respect is one of the many oddities of the universe.


                
this film won 11 Oscars no way IMDb shows that common man.i bet those Oscars were fake with gold color painted on them.this movie is too long & highly overrated piece of crap.Ben hur is about religion,Jew's & revenge but i didn't see the end at all this film bored me as hell.ill be honest here if you going to make a movie so long without some action in it audience is gonna get mad.this is an old movie for some people its a classic for me it sucks balls.i cant wait to open my own DVD store so that i can put great films in it not boring crap like this/my rating for Ben hur is 1/10 a bad film Skipp it its a waste of time
