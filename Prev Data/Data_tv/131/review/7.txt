"Saint Seiya" is first a very good manga by Masami Kurumada, one of the bests I think. The anime is rather good but the French version is a catastrophe ! The dubbers are, for the majority, very bad and the translation is really awful ! There are lots of mistakes ! But to defend a little the French version, the introduction songs are very funny... "L'aventure est sur ton chemin", "Les chevaliers du zodiaque"... The French-speaking fans will understand.There the anime added a story, which was very interesting: the Asgard Part with the God Warriors (it wasn't successful in Japan)."Saint Seiya" is nonetheless a good anime, the story is respected and it's always cool to watch our heroes speak, move and fight on TV ! And I want to say that the Hades Part (not translated into French yet, I saw the beginning in original version) is great !
