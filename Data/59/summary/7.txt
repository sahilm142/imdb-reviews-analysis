 An objective review of Avengers: Infinity War

 Marvel needs to keep their characters true and watch sloppy writing.

 Quite possibly the most overrated movie of 2018... maybe the entire decade

 Can not meet expectations

 Good, but far from the best of the MCU films.

 Could have been done better, and so many characters now...crazy

 I don't know what to say!

 Crowded and a little overrated

 A fun blockbuster with not much more to it

 The trailer was better than the movie.

 Ummm, did they forget a plot?

 Great Superhero Movie

 Here, there and everywhere

 It saved my faith on the MCU.

 Man, That's Quite a Corner You've Written Yourself Into

 Not as good and not as bad as many write

 Not a Disappointment, but Disappointing

 Comedy Was Good But

 I enjoyed it but a bit overrated

 Sometimes more is less

 I don't understand what all the fuss is about this one.

 Great Movie messed up a bit by the writers

 Expected More

 Overkill Kill Kill

 Another typical Marvel movie
