 Not upto his own standards.

 The book's assassination

 disappointing ;(

 Quite Disappointing

 Great imagery but poor story

 uninspired and corny

 Howl's Moving Castle

 Howls Movie Castle

 Devoid of substance but kids should like it

 I'm about to get slammed, but.....

 Not as good as Spirited Away, but alright

 Entertaining but not as much as other Studio Ghibli's works

 Takes a sharp left turn into Crazy Town
