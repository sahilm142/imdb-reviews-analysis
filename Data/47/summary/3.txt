 "Hamlet" it ain't - good Disney, it ain't either, I'm afraid to say

 Very overrated

 Overrated pap

 Clichéd story and passive central character make for a weak Disney entry

 Un\satisfying New Age Baloney

 The Beginning of the End

 Self-satisfied nonsense

 How on earth did this get such high ratings? What has society come to?

 Snores!!!!

 tragic

 Too dark for kids
