 A decent Sequel with some nagging flaws.

 Has its good parts but is frustratingly inconsistent

 Good but Not Great

 I'm interested in Batman not this smart-mouth Robin...

 Not good enough... but still great!

 A good show, but not as good as the original series

 I still see it as part of Batman: The Animated Series.

 Fans of Batman, avoid this!

 A good show, but lacks the brilliance of the original.

 Despite Getting Used To, Still a Great Series

 A necessary improvement

 Still better than all the movies!!!!!!!!!!

 Great update

 Series started to go bad

 Almost as good as the original

 A great follow up to Batman the Animated Series

 Not as good as the original

 A disappointment

 good batman cartoon.

 Very good!

 New and bold

 Best batman animation soo far

 Has some remarkable problems, but delivers great stuff occasionally.

 One of these crazy Gotham Knights...

 I liked it
