The third and final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is an entry that is once again visually impressive to the point of perfection, but also once again with little substance. Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time <U+0096> that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein's story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success <U+0096> not how much effort one puts in. It is impossible to deny how much effort the whole cast and crew went to in order to produce this spectacular looking film, but they only ever half-succeeded in capturing the magic of Tolkein's tales.


                
I'm beginning to agree with the viewers who remarked that this movie is overrated. Overrated, indeed. I have never been a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I admit, the first movie was visually stunning and used some novel techniques for example, to make characters appear much larger than others as actors moved with the cameras to sustain the illusions. It was really something different that came out at the time, especially considering the number of awful movies produced in the mainstream that year, Lord of the Rings really found a good following in a period of utter cinematic slump (at least among the mainstream and partly in the independent features). I think those idiots at the Academy Awards were dumb to pass up recognizing it for one of the top awards that year, probably best director if nothing else. As the first in the series, I think it was given the best treatment as far as writing, visuals, and editing (which would be the bain of the remaining two in the trilogy), and everything else. Again, it was a refreshing change in mainstream films that year, and certainly one well-deserving of the recognition.But the remaining two films, the Two Towers and now, Return of the King, were disappointing for one major reason: there was never enough in the movies (I don't know about the book) to sustain two movies at lengths of three hours or more each (not to mention the additional "bonus" footage feature on the DVDs). Someone here must've been so proud of their CGI creations and the time and money spent developing the sets that they must've felt like it was just bad manners to leave most of it on the cutting room floor. There is far too much repetition going on in the remaining too movies that could've easily have been made into one three hour film, rather than two.The Two Towers spent an ungodly amount of time with those epic battle scenes between the billions and billions of Uruk soldiers and the few good-willed soldiers lead by Aragon and others. I found myself aching for the movie to be over with, and was sadly disappointed considering my interest in the first one. We are left with a story of fleeting interest: Sam and Frodo on their journey to toss the ring in the fire (though the introduction of Gollum, that ugly little bugger, was quite an interesting part of the story), Aragon and his gang were out to battle the relentless Uruk army, and Merry and Pippin literally got to be tree hugging hobbits. If the filmmakers didn't worry so much about pleasing the audience with epic CGI battle scenes and concentrated on developing each separate story of the various characters in their journies, it probably would've been a much better film. Although, considering that the third movie, 'Return of the King,' contained a nauseating amount of repetition as far as the story, and dragging on time with endless amounts of boring, dreamy dialogue and even more endless battle scenes, I still think it should've been combined into one movie.
Not only endless dialogue of the fortune tellers and soothsayers, but also an ending that never seemed to end. Once again, it was like the filmmakers tried several things and liked every single ending and just stuck every single one in the movie, whether it was relevant or not (such as Sam and his hobbit daughters or the 'Wizard of Oz' ending where Elijah Wood puts on his queerest happy voice as he greets his friends 'round the bedside). The viewer who suggested that they should of ended it after the coronation was right, there was no need to drag on the movie for another half-hour of fade-ins and fade-outs of one happy ending after the next, as they did enough stalling throughout most of the movies, anyways.Return of the King is definitely overrated and was hardly deserving of the 'Best Picture' Oscar, nor for every other Oscar it snagged this year, leaving little to be anticipated during the awards knowing that the Lord of the Rings team would win whatever award was announced. The Academy was stupid for not recognizing it with top awards the first time around, and instead, waited for the third anti-climatic cult fest to finally give Jackson and his crew their dues. There were far better movies nominated for Best Picture and nearly every other award this year (save the special effects nominations).Once again, though, I do think that Peter Jackson and his crew did good with their efforts to recreate Tolkein's stories cinematically. That kind of undertaking for a trilogy filmed simultaneously over 18 months is quite incredible. I just though that, save for the Fellowhip of the Rings, the filmmakers failed to capitalize on the things that would've made the remaining two films in the trilogy something really great, especially if they weren't so bogged down in special effects and cheesy dialogue.


                
Considering the hype, box office numbers, Oscars and everything else, the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been for a lot of people the highlight of film making these last couple of years. And even without very much liking it, as a person who did not read the books and though I feel that everybody was just overdoing it, I must congratulate Peter Jackson and his team of cast and crew by accomplishing just that. Maybe, when things cool down a bit and other projects take their place in the spotlights, I can honestly get over the fact that all those people who think this is how movies should be, clearly outnumber the people like myself who see it as a good, but ultimately failed attempt on producing a wonderful trilogy from a no doubt inspiring book.Peter Jackson did not have an easy job by filming the trilogy, and I will give you an example on how to work with a silly part of the trilogy (I at least assume that the next passage is in the book somewhere as well). It's when Frodo is attacked by the huge spider, and taken to a castle of the orks (or similar nasty creatures).In the next scene, we see how 2 orks get into a fight over I think a piece of clothing. Everybody (that is, the other orks) have their say in it and a huge brawl starts. So when Sam comes to the castle to save his master Frodo, he finds thousands of Orks dead on the ground, only having to kill about 4 of them before getting to the top of the tower, where Frodo is held.Now, in any other movie that takes itself remotely serious, these events would be laughable, ridiculous, the movie would be slammed for it. But here comes the nice part: because it is 'in the book', Jackson gets away with these silly little facts. As he got away with the fact that the whole and entire army of Sauron go on and take on the army, not one noticing the two little hobbits and the creature called Gollem. And there are other examples, like the death and rise (apparently) from Gandalf in part 2, the oh-so easy defeat of Saruman when some silly looking trees come to action... the plot holes are endless.I will be clear: because of above reasons (amongst others), I do not think highly of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It started out with the rather boring Fellowship, went on with the loud but ultimately silly Two Towers, and ended with the incredibly disappointing and not satisfying Return of the King, the least of the three. It's too long, with lulls everywhere and a complete lack of decent acting because of the overuse of CGI. It's boring, silly and not to be taken seriously. It's, in one word, a drag, in particular for people who did not read the books, or didn't take much fun into them.So, in the end, there's a trilogy here that has ruled the box office and that special night somewhere in february nowadays, but I am not convinced one bit. And somehow I don't think I will be any time in the future...As for Return of the King: 4/10.


                
I looked forward to this film, especially after the darkening tone of The Two Towers. However, I was vastly disappointed, as character and plot were subjugated to action sequences. It's true that no one could ever bring Tolkien's works to screen in true fulfillment of their genius, but Jackson made changes that, in addition to being entirely unnecessary, hurt the meaning of the film--and the whole trilogy--immeasurably. The only reason I gave this film a halfway decent rating was that the visuals are amazing and the acting strong--it's the story that suffered.Reducing Gimli and Legolas to comic relief was a waste of the actors' talents and was really a rather senseless move.There were many changes in this film, some that made it work better as a movie and some that hurt it, but a few dramatically altered the tone and purpose of the story in a way that made the moments leading up to the conclusion not make sense in terms of continuity. I will never forgive Jackson for changing how the ring was destroyed. The moment in the book--when Gollum bites the ring and Frodo's finger off of the hobbit's hand and dances with glee at having his "precious" back, only to fall to his and the ring's destruction--is so poignant and beautiful, so perfect, that I cannot understand why Jackson changed it. It is that moment of joy--decreased to something one almost doesn't notice in the film--that is so beautiful. In addition, Frodo had not yet, even in his acceptance of the ring, become like Gollum, searching and fighting for it no matter what. When Gollum takes possession of the ring, Frodo's true self returns. That, too, is significant and likewise ignored in the film.There are further manifestations of this sort of problem in the film. I guess I'm saying that what Jackson did took much of the deeper meaning out of the story, reducing it to a more simple action-adventure story. That's not what it was in print, and given the earlier films, that's not the story we were following on screen, either. The story is about something greater, deeper and more meaningful, and the third film utterly fails at conveying that.


                
This movie only makes the top 250 because the average movie goer was wowed by the nice digital effects and the nice (if somewhat boring) cinematography. However, this movie had no story just as so many critics have stated about Tolkien's trilogy (please check the reception history of Tolkien's novels if you don't believe me-- I teach English). Tolkien was a mediocre writer at best and this trilogy translates into a mediocre bore-fest. I have never seen more effort put into such a boring story. Tolkien's 3 tomes could have been summed up in about five paragraphs but it seems that Peter Jackson is just as long winded as JRR. These three films have about enough story material to make an interesting short film. Jorge Luis Borges would have been horrified to see such a travesty of pointless, long-winded storytelling.


                
My comment here is merely an effort to lead the ignorant, fawning masses to the water, but I have no faith whatsoever that any of them will drink of it. The biggest bone of contention I have is with the tiresomely oft-repeated nonsense that books cannot be adapted accurately to the screen. To attempt to defend Peter Jackson and these films with this claptrap is particularly misguided. Does not a picture speak a thousand words? Has not Peter Jackson used ten hours of pictures? By that measure, he could have covered Tolkien's trilogy 300 times over! To have been given ten hours and such a huge budget, was an unprecedented opportunity but what did Jackson do with it? He made his own interpretation. He got to make these three films because *Tolkien's* The Lord of the Rings demanded it. It wasn't right to use the opportunity to spend the time and money making his own hacked-up version; to *change* the story, alter characters, omit characters, change the locations of events, *make up* various events. That he did all this was sheer hubris – but since he's made profits, he's gotten away with it and only Tolkien's faithful are saddened and sickened. Bear in mind the money and success that Jackson has reaped by climbing on Tolkien's shoulders, having assured fans that he would remain faithful to the book. To those who really think books (let alone long books) cannot be accurately adapted to the screen, I say take a long hard look at Richard Boleslawski's Les Miserables (1935). Adapted by W.P Lipscomb, Victor Hugo's huge novel (longer than The Lord of the Rings) is faithfully covered in just 108 minutes. Peter Jackson had over five times that, so there is absolutely no excuse for altering the story in any way.I'm absolutely certain that any director in the business could have achieved movies at least as good as Jackson's given the same opportunity; and any director that had the brains to stick to the proper story would have produced *better* ones. The Lord of the Rings is apparently the second most popular book after the Holy Bible, which, I would say, suggests that Tolkien writes a story a tad better than a certain Peter who?


                
Sure, the burning guy has all the time to travel from the burial chambers to the front of the large balcony. Convienently placed there is a gap so that he can jump without having to climb a fence or wall first. Whom are they kidding?What happened to Tolkiens precious prosa? The dialogue reminded me of a better B movie. What happened to Tolkiens story at all? Distorted. Raped. Stomped into the ground. It's a shame that one of the best books in the world ends up this way, hollywoodized to the max (though it's not from hollywood, but it would like to be).I think one of the problems stems from the fact that the first two parts - which I did like a lot - omitted so much of the storyline that the third pic had to be just what it is: an empty shell. An action movie. ugh.Brilliant visuals though. Made it at least bearable.I'll give the extended DVD release a try, and I hope it makes more sense.


                
One of the greatest triumphs in movie marketing has finished (or has it?). Regarding all billions of dollars there must be more to come.
It's very difficult to understand all the fuzz about this trilogy. The plot is told in an average way, you have seen all the effects before (many, many times) and the acting is really no acting at all. Yes, it's entertaining in a way professional action movies mostly are. Cut the first hour and the last half hour and keep the battles. That would do this a perfect movie for twelve-year-olds.Yes, many things are professionally done on the screen here and you surely don't feel like you've been sitting in the same chair for about 3,5 hours. But once again. What's the fuzz?


                
Overall, The Lord of the Rings trilogy will be remembered as a milestone in the history of movie making. But when analyzing each move separately, i must admit that this was the weakest. My dissatisfaction doesn't stem from comparison to J.R.R. Tolkien's books, because i think that a movie should always be viewed as an independent piece of art. I was merely thinking about what i've seen.Apart from the fantasy world of the Middle Earth, everything that stayed in my memory were endless battle sequences and Frodo crying most of the time. The former was necessary because of the scale of the conflict portrayed, but the second is a mystery to me. I understand that Frodo is showing true heroism by taking an assignment that is obviously too much a for a small hobbit. But there were other means for showing him being overwhelmed with emotion.On the other hand, i guess that the trilogy would have never gotten the funding without grand action sequences. I may reproach Peter Jackson about his artistic integrity, but i was not there when he negotiated the funding with producers. Still, since the first two parts were already more than successful, i think he had some possibility to negotiate the finale and make it less like a blockbuster.


                
I just saw this movie and I must say that I have mixed reactions to it. While there were moments that I was on the edge of my seat, including powerful charge of the Rohirim (as chill inducing as it was is in the books) and the precarious hobbits dangling high above the Morgul Vale, for the most part I was quite annoyed by either the overwrought, drawn out facial expressions of the actors or the unnecessary changes to the plot. Unlike other die hard fans of the book, I did not miss the  Scouring of the Shire scene, which I always felt was unecessary in the books, and certainly didn't need to be on the screen (which would have only added to the multiple endings, all of which, I might add, are in the books). Also, the change with the whole Gollum/Sam framing thing makes Frodo look stupid and Sam a blubbering baby, which the books definitely do not portray. Frodo keeps Gollum with them because he knows that Gollum knows the way better than they do and would never let Sauron get the ring. He shrewdly uses Gollums lust for the ring and desire to keep it for himself as well has his trust in Sam to protect him from Gollum. He also shares Gandalf's wisdom in being able to see Gollums fate woven into the fate of the ring, therefore woven with his as well. On top of this is his honest desire to attempt to reform Gollum and save him from his misery. This is a key point in the book and yet Jackson somehow managed to mangle it into some simplistic Gollum brainwashing trick. And yet I now understand these plot changes, because they start with Jackson saying "well, we can't have that scene what if this character did this instead?" and then all of a sudden you need to change some other bit, to make that change make sense, and then you need to change another bit ... etc until pretty soon the character's motivations are complelely different. Note to Jackson: don't mess with a masterpiece, Tolkien had a few thousand more IQ points and a whole lot more time to perfect his story, don't go astray because you think a particular shot would be "cool". Once you start unravelling such a intricate ball of yarn, it's hard to knit the thing all back together again (err, something like that, you get the idea).
Now having said that, the movie could have been much worse, which is something all the naysayers have to remember, a hollywoodised version of this movie would have been The Matrix or some such drivel. Luckily for Jackson though, he had such solid material to go on, and a litle skill, that it would have taken some serious incompetence to completely botch it. At times in the movie I am reminded that Jackson is a relatively inexperienced director, having directed mostly low budget B-movies (Dead Alive anyone?) and so I would give him an A for effort, but what would have happened if he would have teamed up with a more seasoned director to add some weight to many scenes which obviously lacked it (that final shot of Frodo waking up in the bed was downright painful). Please no more slow motion facial expressions, we get the idea, they're sad/angry/happy, you don't have to "light it up in neon" as one critic said. A fine effort, and it will gross billions, but far from the masterpiece people claim it to be.


                
I had expected to enjoy this film as much as the first two, or even more; but I felt glad when it was over, and my disappointment makes me feel ungenerous toward it. Technically it's the best of the three, less slapped-together-looking, and some parts of it succeed, finally, in capturing the authentic Tolkien atmosphere. But some parts--and sometimes the same parts--are just boring, others are just noisy, the director has begun to repeat himself, and in this culminating installment his inability to come to grips with the crux of the story becomes evident.The previous films, despite their faults, held me all the way through; this one had me wanting to leave after a few minutes. The previous films filled me with a sense of wonder, over and over; this one has it only seldom (as in the lighting of the beacons), and in some places where it might show, it's swamped by the director's overfondness for grue and beasties. I never liked his Orcs (extras in Halloween masks), and here he turns the army of the dead into the Pirates of the Caribbean. The previous films kept me in the world they created; this one kept throwing me out of it, particularly in the scenes of Minas Tirith--where, as an example, the faces, unlike those of the Shire and Rohan, included several that were joltingly contemporary (possibly belonging to friends of the director). The previous films, though of course they cut much from the books, included the essentials of the story; this one eliminates much, including everything to do with Saruman (the parley at Orthanc, the pollution of the Shire, the fates of Saruman and Wormtongue). We see Eowyn and Merry's wounding, but not their healing; we see a Palantir, but not Denethor's; we see Sam with the Ring, but not his use of it. Instead the film squanders most of its time on fighting: not only the battle scenes, which are terrific for a while but go on and on, recycling the same effects again and again, but also wrestling bouts between Sam and Gollum, Frodo and Gollum, Sam and Frodo, Sam and Shelob, etc. Then there are the scenes showing again and again--what was established upon Gollum's first appearance--that he's a treacherous villain and Sam doesn't trust him. But the main fault of the film--and of the others, though it becomes crucial here--is its relative shallowness. It fails to convey the feeling, or the moral meaning, of Frodo's struggle with the Ring. The director resorts to externals--dialogues with Gollum the fallen one, Frodo's alter ego--without ever getting inside Frodo himself. Nor do we ever understand what the Ring is and what it means. The same is true of the event from which this film takes its title. Aragorn gets his sword back, gets a crown and a good cheer, and that's it. His union with Arwen comes down in the end to a juicy kiss. And, incomprehensibly, the film omits the most important line of all, Frodo's, when he says what it's all been in aid of: "It must often be so when things are in danger: that some people have to give them up so that others may keep them."To be fair to the filmmakers, they may simply have butted up against the central problem which confronted them at the outset: Tolkien's books and characters aren't dramatic. Individual scenes in the films are dramatic, the actors are compelling enough personalities to put them across, and the combination makes for good theatre. But, as has been well said by the Eldar, it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing.
Everything done throughout 3 massive movies could have easily been crammed into one single movie. I'll admit that the second part was slightly different but the third movie was pure, unrelenting garbage for the most part, simply because it had nothing new. I thought that the reason RoTK was so popular was because Sauron made a return and kicked everyone's ass and was the greatest villain every conceived. But the fact is that he does'nt even ever show up during the entire movie and remains nothing more than a virtual villain throughout the series. All you get to see is the stupidass eye of sauron. If thats what they were planning from the beginning, why the hell do they keep on and on going on about how evil and badass Sauron is? Can you imagine how Harry Potter would be if Voldemort never ever showed up during the entire series? The ending of the LoTR series is just predictable and nothing major happens. Ring falls into lava and everything goes back to normal. The reason this series is so popular is because Tolkien's fans enjoy seeing their readings transit into the cinematic experience. Otherwise, this is nothing but a large scale farce that has nothing new (wars, monsters, swords, medieval themes).


                
I would venture to say that the Godfather underrated compared to how overrated Peter Jackson's drag-fest is. Despite an intriguing concept and decent writing, ROTK manages to put casual viewers and appreciators of good movies to a deep sleep, but it tantalizes all the senses of a good Lord of the Rings geek because it never wants itself to end. Jackson goes over the edge with his third installment, mimicking the mud and molasses pace of the Fellowship. There is something about the ending for the Return of the King that everyone should know before they see it, THERE IS NONE! The final half hour felt like the editors lost the scissors and couldn't make use of the term "cutting-room-floor." My score and recommendation would have definitely increased if not for the sluggish tempo. As a fan of the Two Towers, I was thoroughly disappointed when i learned that i wanted the movie to be over a mere 45 minutes into it. The Two Towers is a great story where everything comes together and everything has a point. The Return of the King is loaded with useless side stories and mediocre acting. If you're a hardcore fantasy world nut who likes to pretend that you are 2 feet tall and living in a hut somewhere or you have a long white hair with a long white robe or if you're just a fan of Orlando Bloom, then check out The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. If you don't have a year to spend and you want creative writing, great acting, and incredible personality, then pick up Se7en, Donnie Darko, Requiem for a Dream, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pulp Fiction, ANYTHING. FOR GOD'S SAKES, THE NINJA TURTLE MOVIE IS MORE ENTERTAINING!


                
At the slow and lingering end of this epic I was not sure anymore, whether it's the "Lord of the rings" or a Naked-gun styled parody of this movie itself. Shame on You, Hollywood! Before that, though, it was as good as the earlier parts. So the first two thirds I would vote as 8 or 9, but the last third as 1. Taken into account, that it was the very end of the whole epic, I felt REALLY disappointed. I don't know, do You have to be enormous Tolkien fan, in order to forget any sense of good taste at the end of this movie. I am big Tolkien fan, but maybe not that big. And for me that movie and the books by Tolkien still remain two very separate things.


                
It's the movie event of the century...and I am completely unmoved! I didn't like the first two entries in the series, and I don't like this one. Right around the middle of the film, when I saw the tenth shot of a CGI soldier falling off of battlements and screaming, I realized that I was watching a farce - a big overblown video game more concerned with mindless action than telling a proper story. The character development is thin and far too sentimental, and even some of the effects are strangely flat - I didn't think Sauron really worked as an enormous spotlight, and Gollum should've been played by an actor in make-up (impressive as he is, he still looks unreal). The battle sequence is practically a re-hash of the fight from "Two Towers," and the Liv Tyler scenes are distinctly repetitive, too. Any of the dialogue that wasn't from the books stuck out like a sore thumb - the wince-inducing Gimli jokes, for example. Suffice to say, I'm looking forward to the day when the special effects in these films are surpassed, and everyone has to look deeper at their dramatic content - which is sadly lacking.


                
I liked this trilogy.  I did. But if you have NOT read these books, they make NO sense.  I don't know anyone else in the movies but the main characters, and the only storyline I was ever able to follow was the one with Sam and Frodo as they were doing the only significant thing in all 3 of them.  To me, the basic idea here was to take the one ring and put it in the fire of mount doom.So how are many of the other things relevant?  What are their purpose? I'm not going to waste time writing about all the thing that didn't make sense nor am I going to post in all 3 trilogies about it.for example... who is this other guy (also a king) who is trying to burn his other son on the wood and oil, and where is the relevance to the rest of the movie?  and the other guy (also a king) not allowing his daughter to fight, she sneeks away to do so and ends up killing the guy with no face and cool mask?I had to ask my girlfriend what the relevance was of Aragorn becoming King. There were other kings.  She said he was the king of all men... ????? who cares?  this way he could bring back the dead guys to help in another insignificant fight that they were all outnumbered in again????  The girl fighting was more significant than that because as the man with no face and cool mask said "no MAN can kill me"   hmmm...If they had all just focused their energy on helping Sam and Frodo make it to Mount Doom, the rest of the stuff would have become insignificant like I thought it was anyways.the 3rd and final chapter here... what's the deal with dragging it on for an additional 1/2 or more after the ring was tossed in the fire?  Totally pointless.Could you imagine what some great directors (and PJ is not one... he took a great story - so i've heard - and put it on film) could do with 3.5 hours + in films?Just think what Lucas and his directors would be able to give in being able to allow much more dialogue and emphasis on storyline and back history if he could have 3.5 hours + to put it on film.


                
I have problems appreciating this film.All that weeping! I can't remember crying so much when I was a teenager. Nor did I call my friends Mr. this and that. Where did Sam get that from? Tolkien seems to be inspired by sagas like the Norwegian Viking sagas (Snorre's Kongesagaer) I read at school. These sagas tell the tale of brave kings and not of depressed and psychological unbalanced kids.As mentioned in one of my other reviews, I have grown tired of computer animations. I found it interesting in 2003, but my fascination has somewhat faded over the past years.I have no problem understanding teenagers fascination with this film. Star Wars was a big thing in my youth. Maybe this film wasn't meant for me...


                
I know I am in a minority but I did not think this was a truly great film. It was good and I liked it but not great.  I thought the story was painfully predictable and just could not get use to the guy playing Frodo.  He just seemed so weak, there was nothing about the character that made me care about him.  I thought Ian Holm did an excellent job as Bilbo and perhaps that was the problem.  Frodo compared to Bilbo was pretty pathetic!!!The special effects are very good, and Andy Serkis who did the gollum bit deserves applaud but I recently watched Braveheart again and The Last Samurai and I thought the battle scenes in those films were far better.  OK, they were not on such a grand scale, but they are more "realistic".  Now, I know this is a fantasy film and was aimed at a much younger audience but I preferred the more realistic battles in the films already mentioned.  To see "orlando" sliding all over that big battle elephant thing just looked poor.But anyway, no doubt the film will win a whole host of oscars and other accolades.  I just wonder if it will still be so revered in years to come? 
7/10


                
Ok, the first one was cool. The second lost it in the middle... But 11 oscars for the third????? "Just shoot me" I would NEVER have  given them one! No-no-no, to be nice to Peter J., I will say, that from Bad Taste to Lotr - A great achievement. Cool scenes, very computerish. No ketchup used? But the book was lost as the Ring itself. I am so sorry to announce, that the battle scenes were all the movie was. Nothing else, really; while the book is actually about life, love and bringing light to the dark places. Oh well, adaptation.... Cool Gollum thou. His appearence almost saved the movie, but then there was FRODO...... Weird, in the book he grows stronger thru adventures, but in the movie - gets more and more like a whining cat. BIG MISTAKE. Sorry. All in all a cute enough time-amusement, but.... The Oscar goes to.....???


                
Where it is not the worst of the three (TTT was), it is still a very boring movie, the script has not an ounce of intelligence or grace or excitement. Art design and cinematography are excellent, as were in the previous two installments. The director is missing -probably giving interviews-, there is no sense of plot or purpose. The acting is so bad all across the cast that, to my total surprise, Liv Tyler does not seem the worse of the lot.An unworthy movie.


                
A horrible conclusion to an otherwise awesome saga.The first two movies were good but the way Peter Jackson adapted this conclusive third film ended up having too many plot-holes.The first movie was amazing, and as it went on it went slightly downhill with the second; although it was still a great movie.This third just didn't keep up. I don't understand how it's the higher scoring of the three on many sites and praised... it was horrible in comparison.What about those ghosts? Why didn't they just go to the ghosts to begin with? They slaughtered everything. It was comical. Stupid.
Everyone said it was great--the final piece of the puzzle--the fantastic finish--all good things must come to an end.I found only the last part of the statement to be true. I was excited about the Return of the King. After all, it the trailers looked amazing, the CG sweeps were stunning, and what we'd been waiting for for a long time had finally come true. I was disappointed.I have read the three Tolkien books. I have no idea why anybody would read them, but the first two movies were great--that sense of adventure, journey, comradery--all formed together to make a masterpiece. But what we can see when we look at the Return of the King, is that Peter Jackson ceases to make a movie about the characters you've grown to love, and instead shows hundreds of thousands of men and orcs duking it out for most of the movie. I found it exciting at first, and then boring. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas disappeared for most of the movie. That was a HORRIBLE directing choice. Whether it was in the books or not. What made the battle of Helm's Deep so great was you actually could feel what was going on, the dramatic course of the siege and some pretty sweet moves by our heroes. In ROTK, all you saw for most of the movie was a noisy clanging of swords and an excuse to show hundreds of thousands of men charging and dying. What a lame part of the movie. Then come the elephants. I tell you, this was where i started to feel the adrenaline. This was the type of stuff i had been waiting for. You could follow each individual story of how they brought down the elephants and everything, just like The Two Towers. But unlike TTT, where were Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas? No where to be found. Finally they show up with the ghosts, but then the ghosts kill everybody and its all over.Lemme stop here and try to make an outline: Orcs almost take the city. Rohanians show up, thunderous charge. Beat the orcs, then come the elephants. Start losing to the elephants, then come the ghosts. The ghosts clobber everybody.I don't know about you, but if you ask me, that sounds pretty linear. No plot twists or anything. And cutting away to Frodo and Sam didn't help anything. It didn't serve its purpose: Rekindling our excitement to see what happens next in the battle. For me, it just dragged the movie out. And Frodo and Sam's adventures were just as linear. They're just what you expected: Gollum turns on them, they go all the way to mount doom and drop the ring in. The End. It had as much drama as a soap opera, but that didn't make it exciting or keep me on the edge of my seat, like Helm's Deep in TTT did.The final battle, on the soil of Mordor, was intended to be the final frontier--inspire teary eyes and be the final huzzah. I almost fell asleep. We had all seen it before. No plot twists, just a plain-jane battle. I like violence and enjoy a good battle, but this was just dumb. They make you sit through an entire 2 hours of battle in Minas Tirith and then pull this one on you and expect you to think its all new. Its not. Its old, linear, rubbish. Everything you expected: Battle, Frodo drops the ring in, the end.If only it was that simple. Unfortunately, as if you haven't already seen enough, they make you sit through a good 25 minutes of endings. An ending here, an ending there. An extra ending here, and look! another ending! I would have given a standing ovation, despite the laughability of the movie, if they had the courage to cut the movie right after the eagles came and carried Frodo and Sam away. It would have been perfect. On one hand, i would be saying, "If only i could have seen what had happened next", but that's just what you want out of an audience seeing the last movie of a trilogy. They always want more. Don't give them the last 5 yards. We're like fat people wanting the extra slice of cake. On the one hand, we want it, but on the other, we know it would spoil our opinion of the whole cake because we got sick of it after eating the last piece.The special effects were nothing short of spectacular. The drama was fairly intense. Everyone was ready to see a smash hit. Unfortunately, the Return of the King was another case of---a beautiful letdown.
If this is the 2nd best movie of all time, then I must have been taking crazy pills when I saw it. It was perfectly serviceable as a kid's story and the visuals were superb. But the last 35 minutes were a complete waste of everyone's time and all of the acting was mediocre at best. Viggo Mortenson probably deserves some credit for giving the only performance that doesn't stray off into melodrama or rote, wooden "mailing it in". I saw the first film in the theaters and nearly fell asleep. I saw the second leg in a drinking theater and was mildly entertained. (The beer helped, a lot.) I saw the 3rd one in the comfort of my own home and had to pause for naps twice. Maybe the sheer grandeur of the CGI-fest would have grabbed me more in a theater setting, but nothing could make up for this plodding, predictable plot.


                
****SPOILERS AHEAD****Okay, I see that the ultra die-hard LOTR fans didn't waste anytime pledging their feverish loyalty and almost mindlessly 'expressing' their utter amazement with ROTK here on IMDb; hence its #8 spot on the Top 250 with a 9.1/10 rating.  But lets all just calm down with all this 'best movie ever' and 'greatest trilogy of all time' talk.  I even read some people admit that they never even saw any of the Godfathers....therefore their claim of the LOTR being the greatest trilogy holds NO WEIGHT.This movie was pretty good, the visual effects were a sight to behold....they were amazing.  The landscapes along with the battle scenes, particularly the different creatures, were astounding.  With that said, without the loads and loads of CGI, what real substance would ROTK really have?  The film is WAY TOO LONG, and the mere thought of an 'extended edition' actually existing makes me shiver.  If that's the case, why was this movie STILL 3 hours and 30 minutes???  At times its simply a bore, as I caught myself looking away at the screen, looking at my friends to make sure that I wasn't the only one bored out of my mind.  The 'ending' does a great job of disparaging whatever merit the past 3 hours had left.  The film should have ended with Strider becoming King.  That was main premise behind the story aside from Frodo destroying the ring.  We DID NOT need to see Sam get married.  We DID NOT need to see Frodo finishing his book.  We DID NOT need to see Sam AGAIN with his new wife and kids.  We DID NOT need to see everyone bidding farewell to Agent Smith (forgive me if I don't know his character's name), Gandalf and Frodo.  We DID NOT need to see the four hobbits drinking at the local pub in The Shire.  All of this was totally unnecessary and made the movie even more of a bore than it already was. The last 20 minutes were absolute TORTURE.Certain aspects of the story just didn't fit well with me.  I just didn't get how throughout the 3 films, Frodo was billed as the one with sense and a level head...hence the reason HE was given the ring in the first place. The climax with the ring in Mordor on the cliff was just frustrating to watch. He suddenly gets his 'second wind' after Sam saves him yet AGAIN and practically carries him up the volcano.  He runs inside, knowing what he has to do, with the ring over the cliff all he has to do is drop it.  Now all of a sudden he doesn't?  When EVERYBODY and their grandmother has tried to take the ring from him and he's always exercised (for the most part) common sense and responsibility, NOW he hasn't the willpower to do what's right when all he has to do is let go of the ring?  Why didn't Sam just do it for him? But no, we need one last dramatic battle with Gollum before we destroy it. Pathetic.  Other parts of the movie were just plain CHEESY....the dialogue was enough to make me gag.  Somehow Fellowship of the Ring, with the sentimental nature of these fantasy-type stories, seemed to keep its edge while keeping the story going and being entertaining throughout.  But ROTK is all a bunch of eye-candy and grand events with no real substance. I didn't give a damn about 99% of the characters in ROTK...I only hoped that Strider and Legolas didn't die (well Strider couldn't die because he had to become King) because those were my two favorite characters.  Frodo has to be the lamest, dumbest 'hero' ever...all his whining and yelling and crying got tired in Two Towers.  I wanted all of the hobbits to die; what was really their purpose?  It just made everything more silly.  Of course we had to have the 2 true idiots of the 4 go into battle, slaying Orcs...yea right.
I could go on and on about how disappointed I was with ROTK, but I won't waste my time.  But please, just stop with all this 'greatest movie ever' talk.  There's opinion and then there's sheep.  I doubt anyone will even be talking about these movies 20 years from now.  It's a travesty for any of these films to be even mentioned with the great FILMS of the past.  ROTK before Casablanca??????  The MADNESS!!!  I understand the nature of the story is fantasy, which bears a certain level of cheesiness and sappiness. But please don't try to put LOTR on the level of the TRUE MASTERPIECES, especially if you haven't even seen them.  The LOTR trilogy, with its talking trees, wizardry and scary-looking creatures, is just too silly to hold that type of rank, and it never will.  It's the flavor of the month now, but it won't stand the test of time.  With that said, this trilogy was a big letdown.  In my opinion, Fellowship of the Ring is the best of the three, as it was the most cohesive and entertaining without all the slow spots.  Two Towers and ROTK were big letdowns, each of them doing a good job of tainting what could have been a really great trilogy.  Of course I'm in the minority here, but I'm one of the few that can see past the CGI and grand landscapes and see the silliness for what it is....SILLINESS.  I rate ROTK on the same level as Two Towers, but it was even more boring than that, except for the much better battle scenes.  A good movie and decent trilogy, but stop already with the overhype.  I'd take the Matrix trilogy over this any day.**1/2 out of **** stars
I would have probably given this at least a 9 rating if it wasn't so long. There were some points in the film when i began to get bored. Maybe its just because I'm not a huge fan of the fantasy and sci fi genre.One thing i did really like about this movie when i wasn't bored was how thrilling it was. From the battle scenes to Frodo's and Sam's adventure to destroy the ring.Vigo Mortinson was awesome in this movie. Not only his acting but the way he displayed the character had me believing he was, whatever it is that he was. Maybe thats another reason for the only 8 rating was that i was somewhat confused as to what the whole setting was.I suggest this movie to anyone who has 3 and a half hours to waste, but don't put off something too important to watch it.
