 What have they done?

 One of if not the best animated show out there, with one hitch

 Looking forward to season 2

 It's jumped the shark.

 Seriously, How Is This A 8.7?

 First 6 season rocked, not so much for the 7th

 An acquired taste, but very entertaining

 Often very funny animated spy spoof series

 amazing show ruined by one character

 nice funny litel satire

 Fantastic comedy

 A return to excellence

 Mind-Blowing, US "Anime" Powerhouse!
