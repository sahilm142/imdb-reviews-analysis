Let me just say I also read all of the reviews of how "awesome" the show is. So I went and bought the series. So painful to drag myself into the second season till I finally gave up. Brilliant? NO. Boring and poorly written. You want an interesting, intelligent show? Watch The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Dexter, or Oz. This is in fact the most over rated show of all time. --- That being said, I will also go on to talk about the actors in the series. For me what gets me into the series is feeling a connection with the characters and actually caring what happens to them. With this show they are all in and out and none of them have really personal things going on to give a crap about them. Like I listed above the shows that I said are actually interesting, intelligent shows, they have characters that you will like. Those shows are actually interesting too! So much happens in them. I will admit sometimes The Sopranos could get boring but I always knew what happened and wondered what would happen next. Watching The Wire with my girlfriend I we would finish an episode and not even know what all happened because nothing of importance or interest ever happened. The WHOLE show is in fullscreen format. So dumb. Seriously folks.. You can do so much better.
