 Marriage Is Dead, Long Live Love

 One of Bergman's most interesting works as a director and one of Ullman/Josephson's very best

 The Tragedy of Emotional Illiteracy (Review is about the 5 Hour Version)

 My second favorite movie of all time

 dissects the complexity of human relationships as an almost unbearable shrine to honesty

 Another Ingmar Bergman`s Masterpiece

 Compelling drama with a brilliant performance by Liv Ullmann

 At once poignant, considered, bitter, painfully insightful

 an outwardly happy couple married for ten years face their repressed turmoil when husband finds another lover and leave the wife with unanswered questions

 Impossible, impeccable

 Love, Trust, Partnership, Tolerance and Tenacity, the Order Always Changing

 Monumental

 Powerful, moving, bitter and honest, one of Bergman's best

 Astonishing in its honesty

 Through a Glass Darkly

 'I wonder if there is anything more horrible than a man and wife who hate each other.'

 Believable and Painful

 Must see.

 Fidelity in marriage stops being obvious when we're not faithful to ourselves in the first place ...

 Best film ever about marriage? Quite possibly

 Fantastic, depressing, hopeful.
