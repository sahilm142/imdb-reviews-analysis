 Enjoyable but flawed

 Great Crime Thriller Starts of Awesome but Ends Disappointingly

 bloody fantastic, wubba lubba dub dub!

 Started amazing, went sideways and completely off afterwards

 Really good series... Until the ending

 They put something in the water

 Dexter: Best serial Killer ever

 No-holds-barred crime show

 AN ABYSS STRETCHING INTO DARKNESS WITH A GLIMMER OF SUNLIGHT

 Seasons 1-4 are great, the rest is unwatchable

 Bloody good fun

 My Favorite Monster

 Frank Castle + Gil Grissom x Patrick Bateman = Dexter Morgan

 A Thrilling , Outrageous, Jaw-Dropping Ride

 Surprisingly good until season 8

 It was good all the way up to the last season

 Stop at season 5, you'll be fine

 Doesn't lose any steam from season 1 to 8 .

 Season 6

 Dexter Morgan. Blood splatter expert...

 A Different Kind of Vigilante

 Dexter is great but...

 Like the ongoing story but can get to of the same

 Bar a few technical issues Dexter is a roller-coaster but fantastic show

 Good series, worth watching, gore k18
