I gave up on it halfway through the first season. It just doesn't feel or look like Kentucky. I feel like I'm watching an episode of 'Monk' or that show Jason Lee had a few years ago playing a cop in Memphis. Maybe Mannix with a cowboy hat is the best way to express my impression. Just the way Southern California didn't look like Korea in MASH, it doesn't look like Kentucky either. It's like no one associated with this show has a clue about the place they're supposed to be or the people who live there. Only the occasional 'inbreed' or 'toothless' insult is injected to remind us of where we are supposed to be. The critics rave, but I'm left flat.


                
For as good as the story line was, I have to drop it under even half (5). But it's my own fault, I quit watching it about 3 times but was caught up in it so really wanted to see how it ended. Parents, for sure this is not a series kids should watch. It's like they signed a contract to see how many times they could actually say Godxxxx. That literally ruined how I felt even though I wanted to see how it ended. Just ridiculous and so unnecessary since it could stand on its own, story, actors, pacing, it was so well done but that thrashed it. I just can't understand why shows continually do this, it's not only offensive and overboard, it's insulting to us and to the actual story.
