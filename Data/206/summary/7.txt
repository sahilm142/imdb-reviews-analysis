 More than just a film about cars.

 Couldn't get much Louda.

 Everything It Should Be

 Sure, it could've been better, but Rush is adrenalin-fueled and cooler than a cat's pajamas

 Slick and sexy if flawed. Howard's best work yet.

 'Rush' is a well oiled machine

 Quite good.

 Thrilling Drama Of 1976 Formula One Motor Racing Championship Rivalry

 Very good true-life sporting drama

 Rush

 "Rush" does for Racing what "Rocky" did for Boxing.

 A broad-stroked, but thrilling tale of sporting rivalry.

 The film unfolds like a feast of tasty appetizers that never settles into a meal.

 A racing film that doesn't dull my movie going experience.

 Funny, intelligent, thrilling and moving, 'Rush' is a terrific movie, not just for F1 fans

 Superb Performances...Great Authenticity

 An insightful film into the real danger of (1970's) Formula 1

 suspenseful

 Great intense drama. 7/10

 Even for non-racing fans

 Best Ron Howard film in the last 20 years

 Rush: Bringing Formula 1 To Your Seat

 It has a little trouble shifting gears, but it sure is fun to watch.

 Strong performances and race sequences

 Dramatic tension and Authenticity of F1 in the 70's
