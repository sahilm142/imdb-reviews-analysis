 Best cartoon I've seen in years.

 Adult Swim Redeemed

 Perhaps the most perfect cartoon ever.

 It was the highest ranked cartoon here

 An oasis in a bland, predictable TV world

 Venture Licious

 plain review

 Great show with great commentary

 The Season 4 Finale...

 Hilarious!

 Thank you Adult Swim!

 Go Team Venture!

 More people need to watch this show

 The Venture Bros is amazing and is getting better with season 6

 Fresh, Edgy, and Hilarious

 Best thing since spliced Dean-A

 Another of My Favorite Cartoons

 Especially great for the "post baby boom" generation

 The Venture Brothers is a series that can brilliantly appeal to several generations of twisted minds.

 How could you not love this show?

 A send up of a favorite baby boomer cartoon

 Why Tivo & Netflix were made...
