Ever since the first book was released in 1996, I have been an ardent fan of the Song of Ice and Fire books by George R. R. Martin; the series is one of the best fantasy novel series ever written in my opinion. As such, I have eagerly anticipated the TV adaptation of the books. Now that season one has finished, I feel I am able to give a complete and fair review of this show.Season one of Game of Thrones does an excellent job of staying true to the first book of Martin's series named, not surprisingly, Game of Thrones. The plot of this book revolves around three major story lines: the political tensions on the continent of Westeros that eventually lead to a conflict known as the War of the Five Kings, the exiled princess Daenerys Targaryen who plots to reclaim the rule of Westeros that her family has ruled for nearly the last 300 years until Robert's Rebellion (yes, the same King Robert Baratheon in the show), and the awakening of an ancient evil known as the Others in the north beyond the Wall. The show aptly captures the essence of each of these three story lines, tying them together cleverly so that the audience sees how each of these three threads are being woven into one overarching plot. Given that even 10 hours worth of material is not nearly enough to tell the full story in the book version of Game of Thrones, the writers of the show should be applauded for brilliantly transferring to the small screen all of the foreshadowing, character motivations and personalities, cultures, drama, politics, and emotion of the book.The acting is top notch. Nearly every actor brilliantly portrays their characters just as they are portrayed in the books. It is worth watching these episodes over and over again just to see their performances. Even the children actors do a fantastic job. The sets and costume designs are also very well done - I wonder if there was any collaboration with those who worked on The Tudors, a somewhat similar series on HBO that reminds me of this show in terms of set and costume designs. Now on to the parts of the show that I felt like were disappointing. Even though HBO apparently sunk nearly five million dollars into each episode, the show still felt low budget. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the show was the fact that most of the action scenes from the book were either emitted or harshly truncated in the show. The choreography of the few action scenes that were in the show were mediocre, I felt. Given that the story largely revolves around a war, it is a bit silly to not even attempt to show any of the battles in this war. Budget constraints are no excuse - the History Channel does a fine job of portraying epic historical battles using almost no budget at all.Some other rather disappointing facets of the show that reeked of low budget was the fact that nearly every scene was a scaled down version of the scene from the book (save for the end of episode 9 - now THAT was brilliantly executed). For example, Khal Drogo's khalasar is a horde that consists of about forty thousand warriors alone, and yet no more than about 10-15 are shown at any one time. The result is that the viewer never really realizes how powerful Khal Drogo is and why Daenarys is such an important character. HBO could have used a little bit of creative CGI to easily show the true scope of many scenes from the book. The direwolves were also conspicuously absent throughout the show. In the book, they played a much larger role. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised with the CGI in the final scene of the final episode, however. Now why couldn't such CGI have been used for the direwolves? Budget constraints, I know, but come on, HBO had five million dollars to work with per episode - that's not exactly a shoestring budget (though admittedly, not such a large budget either - consider many one and half hour movies have cost over 100 million dollars to make).Another complaint I have with the show was some of the unnecessary sex sequences. Given the gritty realness of the books, it was certainly necessary to show sex and violence in the show to adequately capture the mood of the books. However, HBO went way overboard here. Given that it's important to squeeze as much plot as possible into every episode, unnecessary and extraneous sexual sequences serve absolutely no purpose other than to mollify desperate and horny teenage boys, and in fact cheapen the importance of the main story lines. I had the same complaint with HBO's The Tudors as well. So overall, this show did an excellent job, with some glaring exceptions. To sum up...PROS: Excellent acting, excellent portrayal of the plot, mood, and characters from the book, excellent sets and costume designCONS: Flagrant lack of action sequences, including failing to show battles in a story that revolves around a war, scaled down scope of many scenes, the direwolves didn't get the screen time they deserved, and unnecessary sex scenes.


                
While I'd heard of Martin and his work, I came to the series not having read the books. The show so far has lived up to my expectations with a well-assembled cast and the budget to explore the visual depth of a richly-drawn mythos. It is an HBO production and as such nudity and unflinching portrayal of more brutal aspects of their lives was to be expected. People in early history were much more intimately acquainted (no pun intended) with sex, bodily functions and death than many sanitized accounts would lead us to believe, so I find it adds an earthy realness to the story rather than distracting from it as gratuitous. Looking forward to the rest of the season!


                
Season 1-4 it is a 10!
Season 5 still very good
Season 6 well ok
Season 7- the dialogue was the most ridiculous thing ever. They are killing the character Tyrion, They do everything they can to keep Cersei around, she is just annoying, before I would hate her because she was so good by being bad and strong. Now she is just annoying and has everything she wants ( so annoying). Sansa saying to Jon Snow: I don't need you to protect me ( seriously a woman who been trough everything she went trough would say that?? She would hug the first person she could and would want to stay close; now Brienne would say that: I don't need your protection. Arya- Sana scene is that from Soap Opera?? Littlefinger's death( it was so predictable and boring ), Theon fight on the beach, being kicked one of the worst scenes. Episode 6 travel time it was just awful.
This is a violently graphic and strong retelling about facing off among various families in an undetermined time . Nine noble families battle for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard ¨Ned¨(Sean Bean), Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. When Ned returned to Winterfell at the end of Robert's Rebellion, he had a bastard son, Jon Snow, by an unknown woman he had met in the South. He raised Jon alongside his five trueborn children Robb (Richard Madden) , Sansa (Sophie Turner) , Arya (Maisie Williams) , Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) , and Rickon (Art Parkinson) . Along with the Stark family is Theon (Alfie Allen), he became a ward of Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark at Winterfell, and he became close with Robb . Although Ned is secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further . Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power . There appears Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) the third and youngest son of Lord Tywin (Charles Dance) and Lady Joanna Lannister. Because of his unusual stature Tyrion has been a victim of mockery his entire life, with people overlooking his noble birth in order to tease and taunt him. Tyrion's mother died giving birth to him and his father and older sister Cersei (Lena Headey) have despised him all his life as a result. He has always maintained a close relationship with his elder brother Ser Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), Cersei's twin . Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne . As Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) is the only daughter of Aerys II Targaryen and Rhaella Targaryen , she is now a princess living in exile, the last of the Targaryens . But Daenerys grows into a supremely confident warrior women with perhaps the most stringent code of ethics in all the Seven Kingdoms. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond . There finds Jon Snow (Kit Harington) , the bastard Son of Lord Ned Stark by an unknown mother , it is here that the skills that were passed on to him by Ned come to light as Jon becomes a natural born leader with a strong code of ethics and an effective warrior when battling at and beyond the Wall. This is a spectacular epic dealing with friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn,Tyrell and Martell and in which political and sexual intrigue is pervasive ; all of them lead to full-scale war . Breathtaking epic version based on George RR Martin novels with exciting drama and overwhelming combats , his stories are imaginatively brought to life on groundbreaking images with great production values and outstanding scenarios . Sword cross , intense drama , nudism , sexual scenes , and bloody fights abound in this spellbinding adaptation . Magnificent climatic battle scenes and struggles including lots of blood and gore ; and adding colorful computer generator images including heinous dragons . The series is well written by an excellent plethora of screenwriters as David Benioff , D.B. Weiss , Vanessa Taylor under supervision by the great creator George R.R. Martin . This author was asked if he had a resolution or ending to the seemingly endless conflict , he replied that the end would be a cloud of dust or snow being driven by the wind across a vast graveyard full of tombstones. The series takes its name from the first novel in the book series "A Game of Thrones" - which is actually known as "A Song of Ice and Fire",and most of the show is largely faithful to the books . George R.R. Martin's story credit acknowledges the entire series under this title, rather than the title of individual volumes. George R.R. Martin has stated that the infamous "Red Wedding" was the hardest chapter for him to write in "A Storm of Swords." He was so emotionally attached to the characters that he actually wrote the rest of the book first, and then that chapter last .


                
Fantasy is not a genre I usually on well with. S03E09 'The Rains of Castamere' caused so much uproar on the internet that it was hard not to intrigue me. I gave the show a second chance, it took a while for me to think it as more than mediocre (I think this was because it takes a while to learn who everyone is and what they are related to / trying to achieve in the show - it's a big cast), but when I did, oh god, did the TV shock me. There's a few moments where your jaw will drop. but after a while - the mistreatment of characters becomes second nature, despite this, this show still finds way to cause dismay. The end of Season 1 with Jason Momoas' character, the beginning of Season 2 (with the babies), oh and let's not forget S03E09. I mean, holy s*** - what happened. It's just. I'm not going to give an explanation about this episode, or this show because, one didn't sell it for me. It's very popular. it has comical and witty dialogue. There are so many story-lines and characters, intertwining to satisfy your thirst. Fabulous TV. Peter Dinklage was my favourite part about the show in episode 1 and that is still the case at the end of the 3rd Season. Daenerys a close second. She's 'bad*ss'. I'm still thinking about that episode. Roll on S04!


                
Game of thrones can't truly be placed into any specific category due to its incredibly organic stile of story telling.When you watch movies, such as lord of the rings or the hobbit(yes I understand that they are both Tolkienian), you know which characters have got "invisible plot shields" which make them impervious the lethal danger, yes Frodo gets stabbed and poisoned by the Morgul-Blade but that all works out for him fine in the end.In game of thrones characters are treated as people and don't get give these mysterious powers to evade death by pure fluke. You will form emotional bonds with the characters and each time a character is killed of it just makes you become more and more connected with the Game Of Thrones Universe.Game Of Thrones also probably has some of the strongest characters in books and movies alike because you can really elaborate on you feelings about a character and 2 people may have interpreted a characters actions differently depending on the persons outlook.This is a very mature show and should be treated as such so if you just want something at and listen to as your eyes glaze over while playing a video game or reading a book then this is not for you. In order to really appreciate the depth of the series you need to pay attention to the context because if you miss a bit you may loose track of the entire series or even show as a whole.The only thing which I can say that some users may not like is the large amount of graphic sex and nudity in the series, but that isn't anything to demote it for, just be warned not to watch it in front of children.To conclude, game of thrones is a fantastic TV show if you are watching it and not just using it for white noise. I would wholeheartedly recommend game of thrones as long as you are mature and over the age of 14.


                
On the whole they have done the book justice. The male characters for the most part were played well and certainly Eddard was portrayed accurately. I felt that both Catelyn and Cersei were not portrayed in enough depth to do the characters in the books justice nor to allow them to develop as the series goes on.The story line was accurate although it did feel rushed and as if they were trying to catch everyone who has not read the book up. I did not feel that we needed to be introduced to Daenerys at this point as her story only becomes central later in the books. It would have been better to allow viewers to build connections with the characters from Westeros first.In light of all the review complaining about the sex or nudity in the series, I can only guess that they are not readers of the books. The use of sex and violence as means to gain and keep power are central themes in the stories and it would be difficult to portray these if they could not be depicted. It must be remembered that this was created for an adult audience and therefore will have adult content just as the book have.All in all I was far more impressed than I thought I would be as I am a fan on the books.
I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but I am a bit of a sucker for anything Brit-flavored and anything period, even if I can't always choke them down in the end. With historical productions, disappointment often comes with too many liberties taken with the facts. Literary adaptations suffer the same problem for those who have read the books. I hadn't read the Martin books when I gave this series a try, so I had no expectations. However I was wary because Starz's Pillars of the Earth, which I also had no expectations for, turned out to be such an overwrought bag of cheese, full of bad writing and direction and what must have been a closeout purchase of chicken-bladder neck-blood- spurters. Then Camelot (also Starz) lost me in the first 20 minutes, and after that I had no stomach to even check out The Borgias after seeing what Showtime did with The Tudors. But with Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage, I thought Game of Thrones was worth a try, and it has been.The production values are fantastic, and the acting and writing are very good, with only occasional forays into excess. The violence and gore are kept in context, although the sex and nudity are a little heavy-handed at times, probably as a safeguard in case the plot lines turned out to be too complex for some viewers. I found the story compelling enough to download "A Song of Ice and Fire" to my e-reader after watching a couple of episodes. It's not a perfect creation, but it's very well done and as others have said, each episode makes you anxious for the next, and without the need for cliffhangers and sensational devices, just a desire to keep going. Bean and Dinklage are indeed both great as Ned Stark and Tyrion Lannister, and Mark Addy unfolds as an impressive and flawed King Robert. Having liked Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau in the short-lived New Amsterdam, it's good to see him back at work as the arrogant Jaime Lannister. Michelle Fairley is a formidable Catelyn, and Maisie Williams as young Arya Stark clearly has a great career ahead of her. In fact, most of the acting is solid-to-excellent. Sometimes the story line with the Targaryens and Dothrakis seems a little too over the top to match up with the very naturalistic feel of the rest of the series, but it's still interesting, and I look forward to seeing how it intersects with the rest of the tale. Although it's not vital to the story, the opening sequence is beautifully done and worthy of mention. HBO generally doesn't half-*** their projects, and they certainly didn't skimp on this one. Worth a watch.


                
I must say that the realization of this series is astonishing. Acting is great, image is great, music is great. The story on the other hand is worst trash. Nobody knows how it will end, but I can tell you, ...unfortunately. It will have no particular meaningful end. Everybody will be killed or die in some disturbing way, and at the end you will not remember how and why it all started, which is actually true for the last few seasons even now. The whole world desperately awaits for a meaning but there will never be one. Whenever the story will end, it could have ended equally well after the 1st season. Even in Chinese movies the tragedy has some deepness, there is honor, sacrifice, values, and death has purpose, in this one if something resembles to anything, one can be certain it is just a vessel for surprising the viewer with another unexpected random death. A pattern emerged and after 5 seasons any hope for a decent story is long dead. The worst part is millions of people are disturbed by the story but they keep looking for the hope it will get better. It never will. When people wait starts to obviously become annoying the author just kills the main character, does not matter how, and this way makes the story unexpected, again. It is so dumb when you actually think of it, that no one put that before on paper, with success at least. You will probably continue to watch, and only the end will show you what an incredible waste of time this TV series was.
This TV show is an amazing vortex of love, betrayal and gore. All of the violence is realistic and the sex/adult themes are handled maturely. I have watched ever since the first episode and it hooks and you in and keeps you watching. There are many characters, so, to hold attention, there are only a few characters focused on per season, and they are developed very well. You will find yourself loving or hating these characters and the acting is just incredible.Each and every actor plays their part. This is a television masterpiece and should not be underestimated. If you are not a watcher, then you should begin watching and you will thank me personally - and find yourself siding with houses before you know it.I cannot describe the magnificence of this show in a review, so you should watch it and have an opinion of your own. I, myself, do not understand why so much hatred goes toward this show, but I strongly disagree and hope that others who watch this series agree with my opinion.In short, this TV series is magnificent and deserves every award that it has won and its rating of 9.4/10. It is worth the watch - definitely!


                
Murder. Hatred. Murder. Dragons. Murder. Nudity. Oh, did I mention murder? That's pretty much it. This is what this series is about. And I watched Season 1 and 2. It was horrible and I'll never get this time back. What's the matter with this generation? The hype surrounding this series scares me a lot. No sympathy at all, no memorable characters (because they all die right before they do or say anything memorable). The one and only thing I liked is the camera work. One of the saddest things is to see so many great and talented actors in this senseless series. I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed that this kind of series is so popular. A series without any morals, without any goal. It's just... Murder. Hatred. Murder. Dragons. Murder. Nudity. Oh, did I mentioned ..?


                
So everyone is complaining about the series being to slow paced. I don't deny that, but the books are as well so there's not too much that can be done there. One thing that annoys me though is that this series get most of their good reviews because people like to watch the sex scenes, they barely even care about the plot. There's plenty of places where you can watch naked girls, I could name some for you if you want...Another thing is that the plot has become to boring. During season 1 it was good and seemed to build up to something even better but then what happened? I know that the writers are just following the books but you can't let the audience get all excited for something big to come and then just drop it in the way that they did. The last thing is that I think they are plagiarizing The Lord of the Ring way too much, sure George Martin has said that it has been one of his inspirations writing the books but really it's quite embarrassing to watch. To the people that has watch GoT but not watched LotR I recommend you do it and later on see what you think of the series.This series has almost become unwatchable for me nowadays and I'm not enjoying it when I watch it, I feel like the only reason why I watch it is to be done with it.
Firstly, to dispel the views of many a reviewer, I am not a fan boy of either fantasy nor the books from which this television series are adapted from.Secondly, I would like to spend a paragraph addressing the views on violence and nudity. I cannot for the life of me understand the accusations of sexually explicit content and hideous violence being completely unfounded, doing nothing for the show. In that accusation alone you disprove your claim. By admitting your repulsion, you have simultaneously admitted that the tone and setting have worked perfectly. You are supposed to be repulsed. You are meant to think these scenes are common place, and against your will or not, they absolutely do add to the tone that the writer was attempting to achieve. A time of different morals, casual exploitation, and a world where men rule and women are objects. This only makes the leading female characters of the show all the more enthralling when they dominate a scene and act as a catalyst for huge plot twists. Joffrey's mother is a constant schemer and her character contrasts perfectly with the "hundreds" of naked women on screen (a gross over-exaggeration).To comment on the violence and nudity in such a manner only depicts to a viewer like myself that this show, simply put, does not adhere perfectly to your tastes. Personally, without the violence and adult themes, this show really would be about as gritty as silky knickers. Grow up and accept the fact that in this day an age, you cannot get the budget to produce an adult-aimed TV show and omit violence. Where it differs from Lord of the Rings is that it attempts to at least partly set itself against the back drop of the notoriously gritty middle ages. What were you expecting? Fairy's? Every single act of violence serves to remind you that this is a vicious age. It comes from all characters, sometimes feeling forced, sometimes feeling gratuitous. More often than not however, it comes from the characters who themselves love violence (the hound, Joffrey etc...) Given the sheer volume of plots, sub-plots, characters and material to process, I think you are being completely unreasonable expecting some critic friendly genius masterpiece that equals the sopranos for complexity and realistic drama. The sopranos is set in a real city, in the current age, don't be so ridiculous as to cast the same eye over these two shows.I saw a review whereby somebody had watched "6 minutes" and dismissed it as drivel. You honestly expect somebody to take your review seriously!? It is without doubt a slow burner, the characters are not given enough screen time per episode... maybe because it is an hour long and there are 7 divisions of character to depict. Rest assured early viewer, the characters screen time will add up by the second series. You will begin to understand in greater detail the motives and development of them, and if you can stomach the odd bit of violence and sex- hell, if you are even enough of a shameful human being to actually enjoy these things on screen (as I am) then you WILL love this show, you will appreciate its place on the television today, and you will ignore the opinionated television snobs who have watched two episodes and feel it necessary to moan about the adult content, on an adult themed TV show. Don't watch it, don't give a review on it. I have never felt it necessary to watch sex in the city, I know it does not appeal to my taste. If I did, I would comment that it is shameful rubbish that warps the minds of human beings far more than an epic fantasy drama set a thousand years ago does. But I don't, because it is not a show that is MEANT to appeal to me. It is not made for people like me.Game of thrones is well worth a chance. I gave it a chance and I do not regret it.


                
As per usual, the IMDB fan base has flooded the review section with biased trash.
It's either 10/10 or 1/10. And a load of garbage in between. 
Both lovers and haters have points. I feel it's a good story topped up with a bit of trash to fill in the time.
If you don't like gore, don't watch it.
If you don't like nudity, don't watch it.
If you don't like rape, incest and gay sex. Don't watch it.It's a good watch if you don't mind these things. Personally i have gotten sick of the whole notion of what i call "shock value" in tv series. Killing off characters or having a rape scene purely because there's nothing else to do.
And the men, wow! This show is actually rather sexist towards men. Women have all the power in this show, which given the age the show was set for really makes no sense at all. But i realise it's the in thing these days.
Having a 12yo girl (let alone any 16-17yo) become a hero is just stupid imo. It's an adult show we don't need 12yo's running around acting hero. She is a good actor and does her job very well but just portrays a ridiculous character.Decide for yourself, don't let the 99% of completely biased 10/10 - 1/10 reviews fool you.
Both have their merits and it's worth deciding for yourself, don't let the die hard fans or haters decide for you.


                
I have been hearing about it several years but last year I decided to watch since I have already missed all the season of franchise. I had to watch the whole 5 season consecutively in a month in order to comprehend the series.I would say it was spectacular in term of story line,effect, acting and more politics. the only thing that disappoints me is vulgarity and nakedness.overall,when one watch it you feel that somehow you are part of it.those who are looking for some grat effect and fantasies this could be better choice.


                
Since season 5 , everything is rushed , empty dialogue , only the special effects are making it worth to watch , hope its gonna change.


                
Having got myself right up to date with GoT with a megabinge and finishing on, what is currently Season 4 episode 4 I feel there is enough within 3 and a bit seasons to give it a fair review, but.....for a series that is still going it can only be a review of what it is "So far!" and not as whole because who knows what will come next.First up, Season 1....Magnificent, glorious, stunning, original, daring, explicit, all these words and more I could pour into the season 1 cup and it would not have room for the rest. Every episode is absolutely gripping and you are dying to find out what happens next. All acting is superb and bettered only by the mind blowing production values (Seriously, I have seen Hollywood feature films with cinematography and visual effects that aren't this good!) and thoroughly mesmerising scripts. Make no mistake, this is no Harry Potter, or even Lord Of The Rings and it is absolute NOT for children! The gore is shockingly OTT and the sexuality, constant full frontal nudity and the harshest of expletives makes for a very adult series indeed but this time it has the drama and stories to fully back it up.Seasons 2 and 3 unfortunately sort of meld in with each other and here's where the cracks start to appear and......well you know why really but we'll get to that later.*Spoilers*For a start the shocking end to Season 1 sees the young son Rob march to war for revenge. This march takes over 2 seasons and he never actually gets there and by that time I lost interest in his cause and had to actually remember why he was doing it in the first place. The programme becomes a mish mash of crossed stories following characters around different parts of the world, some I really liked and wished they'd focused on and some I just couldn't have cared less about.Of course the biggest flop for me is the repeated killing off of lead characters. This has been a heated subject on the internet and I am afraid I am on the team that thinks negatively of this. Once was shocking in a good and bad way and really kept you on your toes. Twice, was a little annoying but by the end of the third season there were precious little characters left that I cared about. I know G.R.R. Martin has said he does it for shock value and to be unpredictable which is fine but if you kill off the people that viewers wast to know more about it's also an interest killer too and in that I could feel it happening to me as the cast numbers dwindled. Call me old fashioned but the real world has enough bad people getting away with killing good ones so I like my fantasy a little less grim than that and more heroic. Of course I applaud the rick that has been taken but as I say it's been done a bit too often now and is becoming dangerous to the story.There is still much to watch though, the wonderful Arya Stark branch of the story is amazingly well acted and there is still much to be seen in the Stormborn, section of the tale as is the ever watchable Peter Dinklage as the Imp. Alas the rest just isn't very interesting. Bran Stark's tale is a slow and boring one, Jon Snow's is par at best and there is just far too many separate stories going on to get your teeth into and care about.I can't blame the makers of the TV series though, everything has remained at super high quality throughout and even with the flaws they have managed to keep it watchable but still, they had better be careful with Mr Martin as although he has the perfect right to do with his characters as he chooses it might seriously make some viewers lose interest if he keeps killing off the interest points for the sake of shock.That's it so far, the series could get better or worse but we shall have to wait and see!
It's a Nice Show, It has it's own taste, but when people say that it is the best show in the history of television, I feel to punch them on their face. It is a Good Show, Even Amazing, But Sorry it is not near and never come close to Breaking Bad.If you are a Fan of GOT, then Start Watching Breaking Bad, until the Last Episode of Breaking Bad, you will never Watch GOT.


                
A friend brought me A Game of Thrones for my birthday many years ago, and I promptly read that and every other book in A Song of Ice and Fire; just about the best books I have ever read, utterly immersive and spectacular. When I heard the series was coming to the telly I was so excited I could hardly wait, and having now watched the entire series, I am really pleased about the way it was adapted, and can't wait for the second season. I would recommend the series to anyone; there will be some who don't like it, but I think they'd have to miss a few pretty big points, or be rather narrow-minded to do so.Pros Stays true to the books, amazing scenery and atmosphere, very gritty, superb cast **SPOILERS AHOY** Cons Some of the characters are not at all like I imagined them. Catelyn looks too frumpy, the actress is a beautiful woman, but I imagined Catelyn to be more girlish. Drogo should have been bigger, what's-his-name is a big bloke, but I had Drogo down to be properly massive. Rob, Jon, Bran, Rickon are too old. Robb and Bran especially, they grow up during the books. Sandor could have been a bit burlier. Finally, I imagined Renly to broader and more dashing, and... not gay.A lot of that is subjective, but my it leads me to a bigger gripe: Drogo's Khalasar. In the book it was 40000 horse warriors and a train of civvies, decimating entire cities and cultures and enslaving the populace. In this it's more like a group of 50 or so bandits who go around bullying the odd farm. Come on, HBO, chuck some CGI in there if you must but let's have something a bit more epic! And Vaes Dothrak is a massive settlement with the plundered gods of countless civilisations lining the main approach, not a camp site.**SPOILERS OVER** And gripes over as well, as despite the niggling discrepancies, this is a series I loved, and if you've not watched it yet, then you must, immediately. Oh, and as a guide, I also loved Rome, Firefly, Spartacus, Buffy, and Walking dead.
Intricate and compelling, very well written. There is probably not more I could say that haven't already being said.I just want to remark on how well developed all the characters are, even the bad guys which is rare. I especially enjoyed the women characters of the show, all portrayed as exceptional and strong-willed. You may disapprove of their actions, like the queen's incestuous relation, Lady Stark's prejudice against her husband's bastard son, or Daenerys Targaryen's submissiveness at the beginning of the show, but you must admire the strength, ambition, and determination of these ladies. Not like other shows where women are simply weak, victims, or crazy cartoonish evil. And my absolute favourite character is the imp, Lord Tyrion Lannister, quick-witted and clever. What a refreshing show.There better be a season 2 or I will cancel HBO.


                
I was read to give this a 10/10 to the acting great plot and then season 7 happened. The plot got just really bad. It started not to make sense I'm not saying the show really does but it broke its own rules. Also in season 7 I just felt like I was watching a super hero movie wich is not what I wanted to see. Hopefully season 8 will be better so I can give this a high rating cuz seasons 1-6 10/10


                
I don't know here to start I think this should be on top with at least 9.7 ratings. The glorious era of westerous when almost all house were living happily then there happens a accident which transforms the history of westerous and then there is danyreous seeking revenge of her father. Music:10/10 Journey/Story:9/10 Character Development:10/10
I love this show.however having said this i cant ignore the fact that this show is being rushed. You will definitely see a difference in the pace the initial seasons let the time to tell a story to let ourselves be immersed in the world leading to the haphazard getting to the point kind of writing the show has taken in the current season 7 (however entertaining they take it to be).I am disappointed but don't want anyone to miss out on this fantasy drama. It is a great show.. i just hope they give it enough credit and end it well.


                
Im not a big fan of reading books. Don't like it all. But, as I watched how good reviews Game of the Thrones I just thought for myself "Allright, I deeply hope that IMDb doesn't screw this up nor the voters, so I give it a try".I started to watch. Maybe a bit slow start, didn't catch up everything, but as the Series went on, I became more and more stuck. The characters are great in most part. Many fit in their role very good. Now I've finished the first Season and all I can say is: Wow! Amazing. Much nudity and curses, but that doesn't mean that these series sucks, its not that way! Its a really great series and I like it much.Hmh, Im sure that its because I haven't read the books I don't understand completely everything, or I hope at least I understand most of the series (becouse this was my first Season, gonna watch the second now) so.. I could've give this a 10/10 but I stick with a 8/10. One of the best series I've ever watched....So far, I hope Season 2 is as good as this one, or Better..I'll edit my post after Season 2. So far 8/10I must say that Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is a superb character (and actor of course) There is no words to describe, no words. Peter nailed it as Tyrion. Just simply amazing.
This is might not be the most thought provoking show or best written but my gods it's fun unless you don't like blood and guts . And let me be clear about it's fun , you not having fun when you see people get tortured or something but it's fun because it's a world that doesn't exist unlike realistic shows such as the wire, breaking or the sopranos. It also has for the most part a great plot line especially in my opinion at kings landing. Also if you like big fights dear. god you have to watch the show. The only reason I am not giving this a 10 out of 10 is because of season 7 wich got really stupid. But for the most part this is very fun show to watch if you don't mind violence and sex
