 Stunning drama with horrifying and hair raising images and wonderfully directed by Shyamalan

 A fine horror film.

 Good, but too much promotion

 A good movie if a little over-hyped

 Shot and twist

 Classic

 WARNING: SPOILERS!

 Powerful and Sweet, but a little Schmaltzy in places

 Shyamalan offers one of the best movies of the 90ties

 Spine-Tingling

 A perspective 19 years later

 It is certainly good; it's just a shame it was spoiled for me

 Unique concept and approach to old fashioned ghost story telling

 Surprising ending!

 Bruce Willis at the top of his Game!

 This is the Only One....

 Enjoyable thriller

 It may freak you out, but worth a watch.

 15 or PG? Not my kind of 'horror' movie

 what a twist!

 Quiet power lurks amidst the subtly fear-invoking atmosphere.

 Drama / Thriller / Horror / Mystery: yes, all that, but without all those silly FX

 Good psychological thriller with a surprise ending...

 not as good as expected

 Good but overrated I think
