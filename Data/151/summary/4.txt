 This movie transformed my life, but not for the reasons people might think

 And the Award for Best Drama for Housewives Goes to<U+0085><U+0085>

 Where is the adoration coming from?

 what am I missing?

 Not Sure If It's Worth All The Praise And The Nominations???

 A slow depressing plod

 Not very good.

 Painful

 Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay shine; everyone else is just irritatingly selfish

 The true stories would have been better than this fictional movie

 Bye Plant. Bye Wardrobe. Bye Reasonable Ratings.

 Hateful characters

 Of awards and more

 not credible
