 At first, wasn't the biggest fan but.....

 Well made...it just isn't the sort of film I particularly enjoy.

 Good film , if not a little too over hyped.

 one of my favorite interrogations

 Not flawless, but comprised of many individually terrific scenes, including THAT ending...

 Intricate Storyline, complex but is made amazing by its ending.

 Good film

 Quite overrated

 Ok

 Good, But Definitely Very Overrated By IMDB Voters

 Riveting stuff, even after its umpteenth viewing

 Suspect its Pretty Good

 Gripping!!

 Kevin Spacey Nailed it!

 Great thriller

 Simply amazing

 The Legend of Keyser Soze

 POOF! He's gone...

 Testosterone thriller cleverly done

 The Usual Suspects

 Very engaging

 Bryan Singer before the X-Men

 Smart and clever mystery crime thriller

 Very good 'classic' flick, a tad overrated

 Great story with a fictional mafia
