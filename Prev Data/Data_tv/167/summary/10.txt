 The Shape of "TV" to Come

 Just plain awesome

 perfect... just Perfect entertainment

 possibly the single funniest thing I've seen from Whedon...

 Great. Thats it!!

 I thought for sure I would hate it- "Psych, I love it!"

 Good subtle humor+fun musical numbers+low budget feel=Horribly entertaining

 Fun, Hilarious and Awesome 3-Part Series

 The Lovable Villain

 Whedon Magic

 A Perfect Blend of Music, Comedy and Romance
