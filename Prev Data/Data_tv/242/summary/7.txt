 Too bland to truly excite

 good but not powerful.............

 Promising, but a little incoherent

 Looks promising but a little clichéd.

 Newer Episodes are Much Improved ...

 Worth watching (but forget X Files)

 An interesting show, though clearly not for everyone.

 Fringe is Improving... give it time.

 Not nearly as bad as some people are saying

 A little different!

 Promising dawn for the new X Files

 Aside X-Files clichés, Fringe is a very promising show.

 Super fantastic? Why no. X-Files Wannabe? Perhaps, but be patient

 Unjust criticism

 Better than X Files

 Not Perfect but what is?

 Give it another try

 On and off

 fun to watch but lacking ...

 Good first three seasons, then downhill.

 What happened to the plot?

 too x-files, good but not great

 Some things are just for entertainment and enjoyment.

 The

 been there, done that...
