 One-Punch Dude

 Blown away - Like Saitama the anime itself has no limit's to its awesomeness!

 One Punch Man (OPM) will knock your socks off!

 Highly Recommended

 Simple, intense, funny and heroic

 Not your usual animation.

 Nice random plot,Good storyline,Totally worth a shot!

 n a nutshell, One Punch Man is a mockery of other anime without being standoffish.

 My favourite anime

 Grandiose

 Absolutely think one punch man is excellent

 One of us

 One Punch

 Simple concept, great execution

 A must anime in any list.

 One Punch Insanity

 Best anime series

 Stupidly overpowered but still really funny yet still keeping the drama element's

 Hilarious and interesting

 Hilarious Parody of the super hero genre

 Hilarious and Engaging

 Not worth its rating

 An entertaining anime digging into the MANY clichés of superhero storytelling.

 An Amazing New ANIME, which originally started out as a Parody
