 The Best Film of 2011

 Moving domestic drama

 A Peek into Iran's Family, Religious and Justice Systems

 We are more similar than dissimilar.

 A great genre example, that also manages to surprise.

 What's wrong is wrong ... but what's wrong?

 This movie is a window for seeing Iranian people " Their lives" ..Thanks Mr.Farhadi

 Emotionally draining

 Serious and Engaging

 Very good, but not brilliant by my point of view

 Good, very good, even, but I don't see the greatness that everyone else apparently does

 A must watch film

 A slow-building feast of moral ambiguity and dramatic turns

 about vote film and vote

 Frustratingly excellent

 Gorgeous masterpiece that came straight from Iran, but with a universal message.

 Aaghar Farhadi Cinema

 Extremely reaistic

 "What is wrong is wrong, no matter who said it or where it's written."

 I am feeling SEPARATED!

 naturalistic style, universal story

 An enthralling drama...

 Beautifully Executed Film

 The Vidiot Reviews...

 AN EXCELLENT watch
