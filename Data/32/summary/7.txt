 A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it.

 Disappears up its own black hole.

 Multi-dimensional mess

 Not So Stellar

 Good, but Overrated

 Entertaining nonsense, but no masterpiece

 Don't expect too much

 Good, but not great

 Worst Christopher Nolan Movie Ever

 The most stupid science fiction of these days

 Science fact meets science theory meets science fiction

 Highly Overrated

 Overrated. Mess.

 Another Nolan ego trip

 Rave at Close of Day

 Same in style and substance as Inception.

 Ambitions make the filming amazing and the plot illogical to sentimental absurdity

 Already a Director's Cut

 A lot of unexplained things

 Mixed feelings

 Worth Seeing, but not Spectacular

 Far too long and self-important

 Good Movie, Worth the money, but not Great

 Mediocre

 Very good movie
