 Makes Schindler's List look like Sesame Street

 The best anti war(hate) movie

 A war movie that stands out

 Brutal and real...

 ...and keep on seeing after the film has ended

 Didn't effect me but I can still appreciate this film.

 less violence is more film

 Come and See you'll leave in shock.

 general thought of this movie,,,

 Bravery

 A Traumatizing Epic

 See, if you dare

 great European auteurs

 Hauntingly Truthful Movie

 Great movie

 work of a surrealist

 A Witness to Atrocity

 A Test of One's Mettle

 Comic Relief in an Uncomfortable Situation

 Comic-strip villains (half-)punished like in Hollywood

 Mix of realism and surrealism

 Brutal !!
