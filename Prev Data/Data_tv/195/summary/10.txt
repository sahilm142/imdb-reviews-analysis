 Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (Season 1)

 Top notch!

 Section 9, existentialist detective agency?

 Average at the beginning, brilliant at the end

 See the future!

 An Awesome Sequel To The Original Stand Alone Complex

 So glad I bought both seasons

 Still one of the greats in Japanese animation (Anime'); "Stands Alone" on its own two feet

 Brilliant Anime Sci-Fi

 Excellent Cyberpunk anime TV Series

 Follows in GITS footsteps eloquently.

 A Most Watch Anime for Any Sci-Fi Fan

 Amazing

 Very mature themes, well executed

 The Majors wardrobe

 Impressive Anime series
