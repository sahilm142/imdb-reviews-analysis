 We're Wolf Watchers

 As shallow and egocentric as its main character

 Excessive Scenes of Debauchery Highlight a Lack of Substance

 Has someone hacked IMDb, never 8.5 far from it

 Nothing Exceeds like Excess

 Oliver Stone did it better 25 years ago.

 You have got to be kidding-what a mess

 Scam

 Go watch Boiler Room instead, or at least also

 Why do people like this movie?!

 Tortuously excessive take on excess

 This movie makes the Jersey Shore cast lovable in comparison

 Over-rated, Vulgar, Film Dragged but DiCaprio stole the show

 Please Scorsese--hire an editor..

 Scorcese Has Sold Out!

 The Wolf of Bullsh*t!

 The Emperor has no clothes!

 The freak of wall street.. The statement doesn't make sense right?? Well so does the movie.

 Badfellas

 Pretty Ugly

 Glamorous no doubt but definitely not a classic.

 Marty... please stop with the voice over narrations already...

 Rude and a bit funny, but actually boring

 Nobody to really care about

 Jordan Belfort is a despicable person without remorse
