 A forgotten yet great series!

 Edmund Blackadder, A Butler's Tale

 "Don't Mention Macbeth"

 The third part of this fabulous series - and my personal favourite!

 Perhaps not as funny as BLACKADDER 1 and 2, but it sure ended brilliantly!

 Regency Blackadder

 The funniest Black Adder of them all.

 I wish they'd done the whole thing 'below stairs'

 Iconoclastic comedy
