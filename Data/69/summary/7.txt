 A functional plot built up with the most vivid and beautiful and demonic effects

 Aliens

 Less terror, more action

 Switches from suspense to action, presenting a fairly solid case for one of the great sequels of all time.

 Aliens vs Guns !!!

 Aliens menacing and agile.

 At least he didn't give us 'Piranha 2' again

 More Action. Less thriller

 Monsters everywhere

 Aliens everywhere

 9/10 without Newt, now 7/10

 Alien Extras.

 Taught, relentless

 Effective combination of SCI-FI and action

 The Highlight of The Alien Saga

 Entertaining

 Didn't like it that much

 More more more...but less of what made Alien so great.

 Sigourney Weaver: the bad-ass

 Some aliens goofs I've not read yet. And a brief opinion.

 Good, but not as great as everyone says

 Doesn't beat Alien (1979)

 A Spectacular Sequel Betraying its Roots

 A Gasoline-Drenched, Chain-Smoking Semi-Spiritual Successor

 Intense action
