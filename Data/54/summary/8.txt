 A magnificent piece of work and one of the most heartbreaking tales ever told

 Animated film at its best

 Super-depressing, but an exceptional film

 Heart-wrenching

 Powerful, heartbreaking antiwar anime

 Greatest War Film?

 Grave of the Fireflies

 Bleak but Excellent.

 All about pain.

 not worthy to be called a masterpiece

 Touching, but maybe too much for young children

 Good

 Tiny, fleeting points of light in the endless blackness

 A masterpiece, both in its skillful animation and its heartbreaking tale.

 Tragic in Tone Yet Poetic in Substance

 Realistic sad story

 What a great movie!!

 Wow, this was amazing!

 Good but One-Dimensional

 Not an easy watch, but very thought-provoking and beautiful

 Beautifully Tragic

 Very good, but very rough

 A poignant tale depicting the harrowing events of war-torn Japan during World War II

 Heart breaking animation
