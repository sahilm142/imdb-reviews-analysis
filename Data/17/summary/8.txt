 A classic mobster film.

 Graphic and glorious, just in need of condensation

 Inside The mob

 One of Scorcese's Masterpieces

 Innocent To Goodfella To Schnook.

 Enter into the Mafia Lifestyle

 Plot shy but still a decent movie.

 Very nice movie

 Got to be one of the best Mob Movies

 2 enthusiastic thumbs up

 One of Scorseses best

 Logical

 An engaging film that keeps you guessing

 Goodfellas

 A must watch? Yes it is!

 One of the finest Scorsese films and that is saying a lot

 Filmed with a ferocious verve and cinematic yet fly-on-the-wall feel.

 Ironic

 Both sides of the medal

 Wiseguys were never so riveting

 Goodfellas: Good or Bad?

 A raw and gritty movie of life as a gangster.

 A Great Gangster Film

 "As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"

 "Terrific Crime Drama!"
