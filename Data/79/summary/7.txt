 based on theshort story Icchapuran (or Ichchhapuran) 1895 by Rabindranath Tagore

 A visually pleasing film with depth, but with little weight

 A beautiful piece of art, but the quality of the story is held back by Makoto Shinkai's ability to take that extra step,

 beautiful but a bit predictable

 a sweet, mindbending, and all around great animated film

 Not horrible, but didn't knock my socks off either

 Shinkai goes feel-good anime!

 magical realism

 Unique story but overrated

 Amazing concept and story but...

 A beautiful and ambitious movie with small with a somewhat confused ending

 Animated movie worth watching

 It is a shame that this movie REALLY could be better

 A transcendental love

 An enjoyable watch if you like animations

 Not my type of anime movie but still good enough

 Beautiful images and...

 "Your Name" is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie.

 one of my favourite anime movies

 "It's just a what-if fantasy, isn't it?"

 Eye-catcher
