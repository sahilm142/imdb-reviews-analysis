How this made 6 seasons is beyond me. The acting is some of the worst I've ever seen. The set looks flimsy and like it could fall over at any time. The real issues are the story lines. They're just too far fetched and don't flow.Apparently it's an experimental cell block. Where prisoners can only stay if they conform to the rules. No one does and they're very rarely booted out. The worst bit of acting I've ever seen is in this show. When the his brother with learning difficulties /mental issues comes in. It's as if someone said to the actor "imagine an idiots perception of a adult with learning difficulties, I want you to act it like that" Utter tripe. Cast members suddenly disappearing without explanation (They got better work, like Sopranos or the wire)


                
Hello!!??.... The snivelling, petty personal dramas of a bunch of hardened criminals!!?.... Like, am I supposed to care!!??In this (supposedly) "realistic" look at tough prison-life - I couldn't help noticing that it was just a crew of young, good-looking, and fit convicts.... (Oh, yeah?).... And, where the heck were all of the dumpy, ugly ones and the real old-timers? Eh?.... Yeah! Where on earth were they?All-in-all - I have to say that "Oz" was a "seen-it-all-before" bore.Yeah. OK - I only watched the 9 episodes from Season One. But I figured that that should have been the best season of all where the scenarios were fresh and entertainment-worthy.Anyway - I can't believe that this one-note TV show actually lasted for 6 seasons. I understand that for DVD release these episodes were edited due to frequent, male, frontal-nudity. Well - If you ask me - I highly doubt that seeing the penises of a bunch of convicts would have improved this predictable program one bit.
