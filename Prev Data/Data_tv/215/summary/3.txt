 A lackluster series that fails on so many levels...

 Korra Sue starring in How to Destroy a Good Thing

 Simply should not have been made...

 Avatar, what have you become...

 Huge disappointment

 Disappointment for several reasons

 Not even coming close to its' predecessor

 Its not that good

 Not the same...

 This is it

 Horrible romance, good story telling

 Not well done
