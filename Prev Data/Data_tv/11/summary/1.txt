 Are you people watching the same show as me?

 a 9.2....eh...come again?

 The Emperor Has No Clothes

 Sorry, 9.5 out of 10? Genial? Nah

 Contemptible depiction of violence, course vulgarity & evil disguised as solid entertainment

 overrated garbage for undereducated kids

 This is funny?

 10 Yawns!!!

 Perpetuates negative Italian-American stereotypes

 Pretentious. Self indulgent. Substance-less. Boring nonsense masquerading as spiritual witty entertainment.

 If you are Italian-American you should be upset that this show exists.

 Final Show.

 Once Again, A Series Finale That Disapoints

 One of the all-time most overrated shows I've ever seen
