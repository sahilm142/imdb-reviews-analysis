Erased started out as a very interesting decent anime. It already had gotten attention on just episode one. But it made insane progress on MyAnimeList. On merely episode two it was already rising through the ranks of MyAnimeList. By episode three it was already within the top 20 of the website, and with the release of episodes 4 and 5, it broke through the top TEN, an incredibly rare occasion considering the numerous episodes and efforts put into the other classic shows (such as Your Lie in April or even Code Geass). As I type this up now, with the show having 7 episodes, it is already at 6th place, threatening to overtake the legendary Hunter V. Hunter! Even though it is based on a manga, and its pace may feel a bit quick, it is still excellent for a 12-episode anime. With a very nice soundtrack and voicing, along with beautiful scenes combined with the very tense plot along with good characters, this anime brings the manga to life! With a less obvious display of the murderer than the manga, and with full suspense making the watcher want to know more, tortured by the weekly cliffhanger, Erased is looking to be one of the best anime of 2016--if not of all time! You should watch it if you like murder mystery, mind-games, psychology, tension, along with some supernatural powers.Even so, be warned that the anime is not perfect. The ending may disappoint some who were expecting a red herring-- but those who have read the manga will not be surprised. Even so, the overall characters are in-depth, the tension is taut, and this anime is very good.FYI: the highest this anime has been was in 4th place, threatening to overtake Gintama and/or Steins;Gate!


                
It is very good. It's worth a watch. But is a bit overrated.


                
Excellent sci-fi anime
I didn't see the quality anime for long time
If you want to find exiting story
And the beautiful pictures
I recommend it
Go to watching
thank you
