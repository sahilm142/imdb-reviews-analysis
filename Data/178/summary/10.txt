 Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.

 Just when we thought all WW2 stories have been told

 The only one's blasting this are those angry at the 'Christian' elements

 Masterpiece

 Hacksaw Ridge ,because all life matters!

 Mel Gibson out did himself and Vince Vaughn and Andrew Garfield out did themselves!!

 A movie worth watching

 Very moving, inspirational
