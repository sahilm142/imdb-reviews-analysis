 To Heavy for Children

 I felt like I was dying inside

 Emotions...what are you doing?

 Horrible movie especially for young kids

 Underwhelmed

 Depressing

 A Very Sad Movie.

 Not for anyone with children who have depression or troubles in their life

 Terribly Heartbreaking

 The film was depressive up to the last 10 minutes

 Meh. Could have been better.

 Original idea???

 Good story and fun characters but yet idea stealing is yet the same card that Disney is playing

 Poor entitled white girl's journey to entitlement

 Disjointed, not funny and hard to relate to.

 Good enough

 I hated this movie!!!

 What is the main idea?

 Well made, but just too depressing

 Average At Best
