 Good, but less enjoyable than its predecessors

 Entertaining, but not as half as good as the book

 More of the same

 Best Picture of the Year? Give me a break..

 Somewhat Lacking

 Oh for God's Sake, End Already!

 Peter Jackson's odyssey comes to a welcomed conclusion

 The least satisfying of the series, but still good

 Good but massively over-rated!

 Good in its special effects

 A 6/10, missing alot even as a film

 A technical master piece that falls short in other areas.

 Can't say I liked it

 Extended Edition is definitive

 Au revoir Lord of the Rings!

 Better than Two Towers, not as good as Fellowship

 Great until the last 20 minutes

 I liked this film all the way through, apart from the ending

 Overrated

 slightly disappointed

 The end is bitter sweet

 A hugely satisfying movie, but the greatest? come on

 Nicely done, but way too long

 A little too much

 This is movie is what it is.
