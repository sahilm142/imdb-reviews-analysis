 Umm.. No. It is NOT funny. Not at all.

 Cute but not that believable

 Unfunny, tone-deaf, and anachronistic, should have hired Jerry Seinfeld to write this.

 Loud and obnoxious

 Comedy?

 They never met a cliche' they didn't like

 Overrated!

 Marvelous Not

 Oy to the Vey

 Didn't work for me

 Season 1 Great, Season 2 Aweful

 Great for insomniacs

 I resent this show

 Story line that is way out there and drags

 Funny, Engaging, but...
