 Over the top

 Typical DePalma movie, disjointed, confusing, loud in every sense

 You kiss me if I have hat?

 Requires an extreme suspension of disbelief

 You Dirty Rats

 Great for the 80's...not so much now.

 Awful

 Really weird that I can't like this movie

 an over hyped movie

 A huuuge disappointment! Pacino's worst!

 BOOOORRRRIINNNG!

 Like being chainsawed

 I'm Confused!!!!

 incomprehensible classic

 Summary needs a title

 Not as great as it is lauded to be

 not in my top 250
