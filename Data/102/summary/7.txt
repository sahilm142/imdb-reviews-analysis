 Still a fun Pixar effort, but the weakest of the Toy Story films.

 Graduation

 Pretty Good Pixar

 Great Movie - But a Little Dark

 Not really for young children

 We Waited 11 years, and here it is!

 Fitting ending to a great trilogy

 Just as enjoyable as one and two

 Good Movie, Had Laughs, Kids May Be Scared!!!!

 Toy Story 3 Review

 Please Read!

 It's definitely worth your time and money

 Interpersonal Communication

 Favourite movie

 Toy Story 3

 Day (S)Care Center

 Pixar's worst

 Toy Story 3 brings the emotional depth so you bring the box of tissues.

 Toy Story 3 (2010)

 A good kids movie

 Good but not great

 the only thing it really has standing against it is the fact that it inevitably invites comparison with the first and second entries of the trilogy

 A funny and zany children's screwball comedy...but not one of Pixar's best

 I liked Toy Story 3 but....... not as much as the first two films.

 Dark, different, but still fun
