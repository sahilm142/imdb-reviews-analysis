 Gripping portrayal of life – and death – in and around a New York hospital at the turn of the 20th. Century

 The Knick

 It's not just another medical drama

 Time travel, medical style

 Hooked in the first 5 mins.

 Why Wasn't Successful!

 Let's be thankful we didn't live in those years of medicinal experiments...

 It's all good

 Fantastic so far!

 Absolutely great TV and worth the watch

 Excellent new period medical drama

 Based in Historical Fact

 I can't wait for season two.

 Fascinating, gorgeous and compelling.

 Great show..attention to detail....BUT!
