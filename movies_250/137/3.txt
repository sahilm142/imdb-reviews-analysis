I am giving this movie a 3 for some wonderful acting and great cast. But when I see movies that try to rewrite history, and put a slant on it in a particular way, it drives me crazy. WW11, had many atrocities, from the slaughter of Catholics, to 400,000,000 Russians killed. I believe a better movie to show actual historic value is a movie called Enemy at the Gate. We Americans have been brain washed for way to long. Please remember this is a movie and deals very little in reality. On the plus side is some wonderful footage of actual scenes. Some great filmography, the cast is fantastic.Great propaganda film.
