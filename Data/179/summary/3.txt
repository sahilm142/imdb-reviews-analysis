 Just didn't care

 To quote a local critic: "a fine if empty project" - Spoiler Alert

 A disoriented, unexciting film

 Basically one really long joke about marriage

 What a disappointment...

 Absurd characters and plot sink this poor man's 'Fatal Attraction'

 One of the most overrated Fincher's films

 Gone Girl: Girl Gone Wild.

 What is a Mystery is This Movie's High Rating

 Good effort destroyed by another Hollywood cop-out

 Stylish but not plausible

 An example of how a bad story stands in the way

 Don't fall for the big names or the good ratings

 terrible script

 Reality TV meets the Junior CSI

 Be Gone.....Girl.........

 Can't understand the Buzz...

 Great music!

 Real gone

 An insult to human intelligence

 Gone-and should never come back.

 3 points for the hot brunette, 0 for the movie.

 I very long film that doesn't do much for men except say what idiots we can be.

 It Thinks It's a Smart Satire But It's Mostly a Flimsy Farce

 Colossal waste of time
