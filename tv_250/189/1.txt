Why did ALL the rooms change series 2?
The inside of the Cowley Stn change the CID room, Fred Thursday's & Reg Brights ??


                
5 years "in production" with the "whole" 4 episodes per season ?? Yeah right.And it's a stupid "crime show". Normal productions crank out 13-25 episodes per season since it's all just regurgitating someone else's material from 8-10-20-50 years ago. So what's the whole pretense about? Someone imagining they are going to Cannes with a copy&paste job ? Seriously ?????And the screeching stupid "name" of the "lead" - "Endeavour" ? What's this ? A show for imbeciles, pardon my French :-)If there was an Emmy for the laziest production this one would win it for sure :-)))))))))))))))
