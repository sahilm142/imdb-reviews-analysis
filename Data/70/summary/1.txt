 A bloated, self-indulgent epic fail

 An exquisite, ridiculous movie

 Complex, but not a 'masterpiece'.

 The decline of Leone

 An unnecessarily padded and ersatz schlep of a film.

 Dated

 This Movie Moves Like Molasses

 A ridiculous concoction of mob flick and Chris Cross music video

 Leone goes for a Coppola and falls flat on his face

 So boring I wanted to cry- a character study with no sympathetic characters

 What is all the fuss about?

 Just awful!

 Most over-rated film ever

 I didn't like this movie.

 A terrible movie experience

 Should be buried next to Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate in the cemetery of failed epics

 eighty upon a time

 a load of garbage

 Bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, bad, bad, bad...

 What a piece of crap movie.

 An Over-Hyped Piece of Pretentiousness Throughout

 Godfather link

 Yuck

 Once Upon a Disaster...

 Don't waste your time with this.
