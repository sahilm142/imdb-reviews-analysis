 The Man With Hitler's Face

 Remember that......

 A film of its time, without a modern equal

 An entertaining comedy with a great end speech

 About the America that Exiled Him

 "Can you hear that?"

 One of Chaplins best!!!

 A brave and essential movie

 A great last hurrah for The Tramp

 One of the Finest Pieces of Cinema in the Past 70 Years

 Great, indeed

 Hitler gets burned, so to speak

 Great Dictator Great Parody

 Chaplin delivers one of the most inspiring speeches of all time and uses his voice as a weapon in his first 'talkie' film.

 My Favorite Chaplin Film

 A visionary film that still has relevance

 The Great Dictator Review.

 Confronting

 Great movie, important position

 One of the greats delivers his definitive cinematic statement

 Audacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious

 Hinky! My dictator friend!

 The Tramp is a GENIUS!!!

 Probably the best satire ever made

 Excellent Work by Chaplin
