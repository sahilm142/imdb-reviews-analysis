 There are few films that can make me laugh like this one can

 Just as much fun as Lock, Stock. Snatch is a great and entertaining movie.

 Subtitles A Must To Really Enjoy This

 What the hell is this movie about?

 "Well, where'd you lose him? He ain't a set of f*cking car keys, is he? And it ain't as if he's incon-f*cking-spicuous now, is it?" One of my all time favourite films.

 Not bad at all

 A lot of fun

 Awesome movie.

 Snatch is best movie of the year so far

 Everything I look for in a movie

 Blags, slags, lags and gags

 It will snatch a hold of your attention

 Sit back and enjoy

 Distinct and Stylish

 This is how good comedy can be !!

 "Snatch" will grab.

 A Win for Everyone

 The second mark Guy Ritchie has left in film.

 One of the best Caper films ever!!

 Great movie. One of the best!

 Near top of genre

 Packed! Must've been tough keeping the film as short as 104 minutes.

 Great

 Cool movie
