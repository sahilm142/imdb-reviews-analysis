 one of the finest and truest 'manga - anime' conversions

 Amazing

 intelligent

 It makes me wish I had a death notebook

 The ethics of god

 They had us in the first half, not gonna lie...

 Really intense!

 Less a Review, More a Reflection

 Superbly entertaining.

 Addictive

 Flawless anime till episode 25

 When a god of Death meets the Light.

 Kira vs L , the best fight ever.

 Excellent thriller with a lousy finale

 Epic cat and mouse actually gets tiring

 A must watch for any anime fan!

 A brilliant supernatural thriller that has only one major problem.

 Bizarre, suspenseful anime

 An Interesting premise but probably too long

 Fight Between Two of the Biggest Masterminds

 Really interesting
