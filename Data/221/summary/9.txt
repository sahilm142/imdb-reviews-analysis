 Masterpiece

 Saw this for the first time last night on VHS. My interpretation.

 So different, and yet so much the same...

 Like Stepping Into a Classical Painting

 beautiful, magnificent and triumphant.

 They are all equal now

 Very Fine Filmmaking!

 A Piece of Art

 Kubrick In The Late 18th Century

 Amazingly Beautiful

 Barry Lyndon - "A Cinematic Vision of Life"

 Barry Lyndon, Kubrick, exploitation and control

 Barry Lyndon

 Patient and Engrossing

 More to it than pretty colors and dazzling visuals.

 One of the most beautiful looking films ever made

 Not Kubrick's best but still a great attempt

 Ambition goes up against Determinism !!!

 Pure ART.

 Trying to find your place in the world

 Kubrick's perfect portrait of Lyndon's rise and fall

 An all time classic flawless masterpiece

 I have now come to claim that satisfaction

 Just sumptuous
