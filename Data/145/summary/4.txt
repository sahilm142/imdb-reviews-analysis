 Is this a masterpiece?

 Far from a great movie

 The best way to express your grief is by committing multiple felonies.

 Confused film, nothing special

 Overrated all around

 So many things that just don't add up

 bitterness and hate rolled into one

 Just too much foolishness

 Tonally confused and cartoonish.

 Neither funny nor profound

 A story that tries really hard, but is hardly "real"

 Annoying, contrived, ludicrous, bizarre and ends like Episode 1 of a TV show.

 Meh

 No spoilers here.

 Super dull.

 Lost it's way in the middle and no real ending.

 Modern-day Minstrel Show

 Three Flaws with Ebbing, Missouri

 How did this trash received so much praise?

 slow and barely any sort of plot

 Chop Suey

 Wait for on demand! Save your money!
