 True Gem for Movie and Music Fans

 Amadeus Speaks for All Mankind

 One of the greatest films of all time.

 Genius

 An Excellent film of describing Mozart's life from wealthy with great fame that shatters in pieces

 A movie of a genius, directed by another one !

 One of those movies that you'll never forget

 A tale of talent, jealousy and tragedy

 A Genius? A Diamond In The Rough? Who? Mozart? Or This Movie's Director?

 My brief review of the film

 F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce shine

 my number one

 Perfect Film

 Amadeus - Beloved of Gods

 Music and melodrama - a classic combination

 A classic profile of the creative persona!

 Big, fast, crazy, touching, and gorgeous. And with lots of Mozart. Superb stuff.

 Amedeus : Directors Cut Completes The Story

 Absolutely brilliant!- funny, charming and touching, a masterpiece!

 The Life of Mozart Wonderfully Present to Viewers Who Loves High Quality Movies

 A brilliantly ambitious, sprawling, and truly epic film

 Beware the director's cut

 It's a classic

 Did the aged composer kill his talented rival Wolfie?

 This is a superb movie that nobody should miss
