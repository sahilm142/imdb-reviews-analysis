As a kid watching TV shows and movies in The Fifties, I can't tell you how many I ran across that had nitroglycerine as part of the plot. There were at least a couple of Westerns along with straight dramas, but it didn't seem to matter the genre. A souped up hot rod carrying four quarts of nitro that just happened to be hanging around was used by the main character to destroy "The Giant Gila Monster" in a campy 1959 monster flick.Whatever the fascination with nitroglycerine, and it had to be it's unpredictability, the idea of carrying around a ton of it was the premise of this film, "The Wages of Fear". Actually, it was two trucks carrying a ton of nitro between them, I guess to heighten the drama and provide twice as much in the way of nerve shattering tension. The thing is, unlike a host of reviewers who hold the picture in the highest regard, I really didn't get a whole lot out of the movie.For starters, the first forty five minutes or so was used to introduce characters and situations that eventually had nothing to do with the outcome of the story. Yves Montand portrayed his character Mario well enough, but the guy was just a reprobate for the most part. He consistently berated the lovely saloon gal Linda (Vera Clouzot), and actually threw her in the dirt when he drove off on the mission to deliver the goods. Same thing with his partner Jo (Charles Vanel), who started the picture as one of film's ruggedest macho men, and turned into a cream puff when the going got tough. I just didn't understand how characters would just suddenly switch their basic personas as the story progressed.Then there's the adventure on the road. Maybe I missed it, but what was the rationale for that wooden bridge turnabout that both drivers had trouble with? Was it that the size of the trucks wouldn't allow for a smooth ninety degree turn? Even so, after the first mishap with the truck driven by Bimba (Peter van Eyck), why would Mario feel compelled to back his truck right to the very edge of the unstable platform? It didn't make sense to me.And then, showing his contempt for Jo, Mario runs him over in that manic oil pit scene. I have to admit, that was the stunner for this viewer. That scene had both actors earning their paycheck, and it rivals the clay pit scene in "The Defiant Ones" with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis for sheer insanity, in another Fifties action flick. Both are just hellacious, you be the judge.Except for that scene, most of the rest of the story didn't hold the same amount of interest for me. When the truck with Bimba and Luigi (Folco Lulli) blew up, I thought that it would have been better served if there was a close-up of the two men in the truck hitting a rut and offering a grimace just before fading to black and then showing the explosion. That would have better sealed their fate; I had to wonder why no one thought of it.With all that, I don't mean to imply this was a terrible picture. It's watchable enough, but just doesn't seem to measure up to the accolades it's given as an IMDb Top 250 film. But that's the case for a lot of others as well, so in this case, maybe it's just me. On another day I might have seen it in an entirely different light.
The setting is a dead end South American village in the middle of nowhere. Its only distinguishing feature being an American oilfield some distance away from the village. But then an accident causes a fire to spread into the oil and the only way to stop it is to literally blow it out. With nitroglycerin. The only problem being that they don't have the safety equipment needed to transport the nitro from the village. But "luckily" such villages have no shortage of men at the end of their ropes, willing to do anything for a final paycheck.And that's essentially The Wages of Fear in a nutshell. It's about human desperation and about ever-mounting stakes as the tension keeps rising and rising. Every little tremor or stone on the road could send all four men into the sky in a fiery explosion of primordial forces. And even though you're safely hunkered on your coach, behind the reality line of a TV screen, you can't help but sweat in anguish alongside these men. The film is that well shot.That being said, it takes its sweet time getting there. The first portion of the film is spent getting to know the village and these four wretched souls. And while they are interesting personalities, played by talented actors, it still drags quite a bit. And that's partly because at that point you don't have much of an idea where the film is going. Most of the loose threads get tied up towards the end, but a good half of the film is a jumbled mess.But that other part where they're actually transporting the explosives is so good that it more than makes up for the weaker first half. Recommended for all fans of intense.


                
Clouzot was a very strange director. Even he admitted that he used suspense as a device to examine his characters. Only Diabolique seems to have any real suspense. The nitro in this film is used the same as the letters in The Raven and the murder in Quai Des Ouvres: he is up to his old tricks of immersing you in the rot and smell of existence: buzzards, spitting, smoke coming disgustingly out of noses during a kind of Russian Roulette, etc. Only one other film do you feel the sheer heat of a place as much as this: Stray Dog. Nineteen Fifty three was more or less around the apotheosis of Existentialism, And Clouzot hardly needed a bedside copy of Being and Nothingness for his handbook. This film, because of it's length, has the greatest wealth of his bodily references.... Even down to Vera Clouzot's underarm hair: you see a flash of it as she raises her hands in a dance turn with Folco Lulli, and how often do you ever see a woman's underarms not shaved, even in French Films, much less anywhere else. For those who found the film suspenseful, fine. I didn't. Not at its heart, anyway. That would be like saying Polanski's Repulsion was suspenseful. Both are films of immersion, descents into madness and chaos. And now here is a spoiler: if you do not want to know how the movie ends, bye bye. The end is ludicrous. But then so are most in his films. None of them hold up very well, with the possible exception of the the end of Diabolique: its mystical take kind of works. However, the mystical take of Montand's death here is simply stupid. If he has to go off the road and down a cliff, let the truck he is driving simply suffer a sudden blowout, or differential fatigue, some kind of mechanical malfunction...not playing with it on the road like a three year old......and even then, certainly not have Vera Clouzot know telepathically that he has gone over to his death. But there are so many fine touches in this movie, you watch it for them. Too bad it could not have been a much more disciplined effort, but what it there makes most movies today seem tired and trite. Also, for those interested, notice the striking similarity of the opening images of this film, and the first shots of The Wild Bunch. Just too bad he could not have ended the film on such a pure note. But bravo anyway, great treat, wonderful film.
I found the first half of this, despite the pace very engaging in its slow, languid style, punctuated by some very captivating images. Vera Clouzot crawling around, cleaning the dirty floor with her half-crazed mannerisms is surprisingly sexy. The sense of boredom, heat, dirt, desolation and despair is palpable and convincing.The second half of the film is surprisingly formulaic and predictable. It starts off with some nerve-wracking Hitchcockian scenes they soon loose their suspense. I had a pretty good idea what was to become of the drivers and was pretty much unsurprised by turn of events.The conclusion is unbelievable and bordering on stupid with it's anti-Hollywood ending.I think this movie would have been a lot more interesting if it stayed in the god-forsaken town and didn't attempt to venture out into the world of suspense. Still, a striking debut for a director, just a bit overrated.


                
Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear follows the lives of four men who agree to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerin for an oil company to put out the fire on a derrick that has been burning for days without stopping. These are men without prospects or hope who've found themselves in a little South American village without money and jobs, who only dream of leaving and whom no one will miss if they die. That's what makes them so suitable for the oil company: they're dispensable.This is a fascinating premise for a suspenseful thriller. But Clouzot took too much time setting up the situation. The movie begins with impressive realistic shots of an ordinary day in a poverty-stricken, forsaken hell-hole where everyone is semi-naked or dirty, jobless, and suffering from the heat. It's a picture of filth, squalor and cruelty. But Clouzot's camera just keeps shooting filth, squalor and cruelty for almost an hour before the actual action starts. He made his point ten minutes into the movie, the rest was just pointless.I grew tired of the first hour because it lasted two long. But I also grew tired of Linda (played by the mediocre Vera Clouzot), the only female character in the movie, and the love interest of the main character, Mario (an amazing performance by Yves Montand). Watching the movie, I remember fearing Clouzot would find some way of putting her inside one of the trucks. Fortunately that didn't happen and once the four men leave the village, I didn't have to suffer Vera until the disappointing ending again.After the first hour the movie becomes thrilling; it becomes not only a fast-paced adventure thriller but also a meditation of courage, cowardice, the value of human life, the friendship and hatred that arises between men in difficult situations, and human ruthlessness. Clouzot does not portray mankind in a bright light. People, he says, under the lure of money, can and will do anything to succeed.Although Yves Montand was the main character, my hats are off to Charles Vanel for playing Jo, arguably the most complex character in the movie. Jo shows up in the little village and quickly fascinates Mario with his grace and calm demeanor under pressure. One can even say Mario worships him, following him everywhere around. But during the journey Jo reveals to be nothing but a coward, shattering Mario's illusions. Jo is fascinating because even though he's a coward and a hazard for the mission, there's something familiar in him that should draw sympathy and compassion from any person.The ending is a disappointment, like every movie by Clouzot I've seen tends to be. He seems to put happy endings where unhappy endings should be, unhappy ones in the place of happy ones, and moral ones where ambiguous ones should be. It's very strange. All I know is the ending left me wandering what was the point. These complaints aside, I enjoyed this movie.
No, this is not an horrible movie and I did not disliked watching it but I absolute didn't seem to like it as much as most other people seem to do and in my opinion the movie is currently being way overrated.I'll give the movie that it was a bit of an unique one for its time. It actually has a pretty good premise, lots of action movies now days would be jealous off. However it doesn't really make this movie a fantastic or spectacular one to watch, though I'm taking it into account that this movie was from before the period that the action-genre got actually first fully developed. But by saying all this, you shouldn't think that this is an action packed movie with gun fights or anything but it's more a movie that takes an action type of approach with its style and story-telling, of its somewhat adventurous story, that gets brought very tense to the screen.I really had quite some problems with this movie. One is not even it's long running time of two and an half hours but more its set-up of its story and characters. Once you start thinking about it you should wonder of the first 30 minutes, or so, were truly needed for the movie or not. It's unnecessarily slow and it was mostly meant to introduce and set-up its character but they could had done this all a lot quicker really. And the characters aren't even that much good to begin with. Problem with them is that are some lying and cheating bums, who do everything for some money. I just could never fully like any of them, so therefore the movie already fell emotionally flat and became a distant one to watch.But yes, it's definitely true that the movie becomes a much better one to watch in its second half, when finally good and interesting things start to happen. They came up with some pretty good moments for the movie, that often work out real tense. They are being build-up well and executed surprisingly good and also original.But no matter how original the movie gets with some of its moments, the movie remains a very predictable one, or at least to me it was. I was not even surprised or taken away by its not-so-Hollywood-like ending. It got done a bit too obvious, in its build up toward it.Nevertheless this movie still remains a great and also unique achievement, from director Henri-Georges Clouzot. It's a French movie, in which a whole lot of different languages gets spoken by its characters. Besides French we have Italian, Spanish, English and some German, just to name a few languages that get spoken throughout this movie. It's simply a well directed and also good looking movie, aside from its settings that don't really seem to suit the movie its premise.The movie is supposedly set in an unnamed South-American country but the movie looks nothing like a South-American country at all. At first I even thought that the movie was being set in Marocco (also due to the many different languages being spoken in it) or some other northern African country. It's just one of those other little things that prevented me from truly getting in this movie and liking it as much as everybody else seems to do.It's a good movie, especially for its time but there was nothing in this movie that was surprising or truly grabbing me.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/


                
For a long time I just believed that France made nothing but tedious movies. I found so-called classics by Truffaut and Godard tedious talk fests that were somewhat pretentious and ultimately pointless.  When I saw Wages of Fear years ago it made me realize that there were French directors who actually were capable of making good dramas.  A straightforward drama, the movie is engrossing throughout and the second half is absolutely gripping. This is a French movie without people sitting around talking about the meaning of it all like college sophomores, and it combines a grittiness with a sense of humanity that makes it a remarkably intelligent film.  I don't consider it a great movie - I gave it a 7 - but it's a very good movie, well worth watching.  Now I'm going to complain about the movie's artistically lazy, pretentious last five minutes, so here we need a spoiler alert.**********SPOILERS***************** After avoiding French philosophic pretensions for over two hours, Clouzot caves in at the end.  It's not just that Mario dies in a car crash after surviving a harrowing journey - that sort of irony is trite but understandable.  It's that weird waltzing-driving thing.  It's as if at the end Clouzot said, I'm French, I need to make a statement about how life is ultimately purposeless and we're all blithely waltzing towards death.  Give me a break. **********END SPOILERS*************
1st watched 3/9/2014 -- 7 out of 10(Dir:Henri-Georges Clouzot): Tense French film about an American Oil company's hiring of four gentlemen from a poor village in what I think was Central America to complete a monumental task of hauling explosives 100 miles on dirt roads to help the SOC(Southern Oil Company). The movie starts with the arrival of one mafia-like gentlemen named Jo into the small village looking for an opportunity to make money. After seeing another Frenchman named Maury, looking like he was doing pretty well for himself, he sticks around. The other two future drivers are locals who have learned that you have to work for the American company to survive , but one named Luigi decides to take this new job after contracting concrete in his lungs from his current position. The director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, sets the stage by introducing the characters and the area for at least 30 minutes before introducing the main plot line. The explosives that they are carrying in the trucks are very brittle and this is shown to the interviewees so that they understand the danger involved. These folks though, have nothing to lose --- and so they pursue the possibility of $2000 per person without a whole lot of reservation. The hazards that await are mostly natural ones like a giant boulder blocking the road, and the sickness of one of the drivers but definitely hard to deal with. The movie is not really about the trek, but rather how the characters handle their quest. Character's true identities are revealed as they battle the road and themselves. Because this is a foreign production there is an air on un-certainty about what is going to happen and for me creates some extra suspense. The performances are worthwhile and the direction is almost flawless with my only real issues being the quick ending and quick demise of one of the trucks. This is kind of an anti-Speed movie that is almost as thrilling as the before-mentioned American movie. At 2 and 1/2 hours long it never gets boring...an excellent movie overall and a brilliant piece of filmmaking by the French director.
