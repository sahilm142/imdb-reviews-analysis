 I thought i'd seen it all

 One of a kind - a TV Series that actually gets better as it progresses

 Amazing

 The best show .... ever

 Great TV

 Outstanding

 What hype? This excellent show deserves better reviews.

 A Brilliant show let down by its debut season

 A show that many seem to miss the point of.

 Excellent and Intense Drama

 Outstanding!!!!

 This is an awesome show, but not one for those afraid of realism.

 Some people just don't get it...

 "The Shield" is one of the most morally complex dramas on TV

 A show which some viewers may love and some may hate...

 Best Show on Television

 People, that little "TV-MA" is there for a reason. . .

 CSI with a story arc and better acting

 Riveting

 Masterful study of denial and self deception, along with a thorough exploration of the dregs of society. A real treat.

 Hard hitting TV for adult viewers

 One of the (if not the) best shows of TV!

 Simply Stated: Incredible

 Shield Great Show

 Consistently thought-provoking and gripping television
