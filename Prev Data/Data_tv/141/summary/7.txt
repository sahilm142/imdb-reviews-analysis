 Excellent series with intense drama , corruption and gangster fights ; including lush set design , evocative cinematography and top-notch acting

 On the Boardwalk of Alantic City

 Not the masterpiece we all expected...

 Could Be Better

 Boardwalk Empire was worth watching till season's 2 finale

 Steve Buscemi

 final series was naff

 Flawlessly executed

 The Tale of the Unlikely Gangster

 Good Show with a few miscues
