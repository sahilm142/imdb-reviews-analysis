This movie was completely confusing. It is nothing but a bunch of scenes strung together but there is no logical order to them. You could take the film, cut it at every scene junction and then toss the pieces on the floor and let a bunch of goats loose to prance about on them for an hour or two to scramble them up real good. Then pick them up at random and splice the pieces together. You couldn't tell the difference before and after. As long as the opening and closing credits were at the front and back it would be the same movie as what the producers released. This review applies equally to the Alec Guiness and Gary Oldman films. Both aren't worth watching, unless you feel compelled to watch them several times to try to figure them out. Not worth the bother.
