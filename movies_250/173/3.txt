Like i said before i'm not a huge fan when it comes to silent films. The music playing in this movie felt like it was the same tune playing over and over again. it was annoying. The movie was short so thank god for that. The story and how the movie was made on the other hand was actually entertaining. Still i don't know how they did it since technology wasn't advanced back in the day as today is so i give it a two big thumbs up for that. Buster Keaton expressed himself very well on the message he was sending across. just like Charlie Chaplin, i called out everything Buster was going to do before he did it and now i see where Charlie got some of his ideas from.
