After seeing how high the overall rating is on this, I felt compelled to give my honest opinion. I'll be going off of considerable memory, because I saw it a few years ago and I don't want to bother watching it a second time. The line between clever and obnoxious is thin indeed. I certainly didn't feel that Dr. Horrible was so smart that it went over my head. I felt it was tailored for an audience easy to make laugh. Much like the lyrics to Wicked, the lyrics to these songs sound unnatural to human speech (for example, the usage of the word "dolt,") like the writings of a pubescent nerd itching to show you how sophisticated he thinks he is. I should know. I was that kind of kid once. As for the composing, the orchestration is flat and un-musicianlike, more suited to Dora the Explorer. Something about the sound mixing rubs me the wrong way as well; I like voices in musicals to echo. The story didn't make me worry for it, in the first place because I don't take the superhero-and- villain setup seriously (CAMP!!) and in the second place because I don't like Harris or Felicia Day as screen personalities. From my high school friends' affection for the movie, I expected I should feel a connection, but it wasn't there. Now that I think about it, I know why. Your mileage may vary, but I despise the cliché of the gawky, immature male protagonist pining after a woman much more attractive and on top of things than him. It appalls me that even women tolerate this trope, as I find it demeans us. I have read a few anthropological, sociological and scientific texts embracing the fact that women gravitate towards "alpha males." Captain Hammer, of course, is both an alpha male and a jerk. Dr. Horrible is, dare I say. . . such a Nice Guy. So it's not sad that he kills the woman he loves. Wait a minute, is this supposed to be like a Greek tragedy where we're supposed to recognize the protagonist's fatal flaws? It doesn't matter, because I didn't enjoy watching it.
