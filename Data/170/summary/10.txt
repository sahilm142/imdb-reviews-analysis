 You can watch it a million times, and yet, it will never get old

 The Most Quotable Film of All Time

 Greatest movie ever made.

 The Dude Abides!!!

 A Scrumptious Je Ne Sais Qua

 A Great film

 It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners."

 over-rated

 "Far out!"

 "Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man."

 Pure Genius

 Arguably the Coen Brother's funniest work, with a superb lead in Bridges

 A True Masterpiece

 My favourite movie of all time

 When you are feeling down and out ... or just need a good jolt!

 A wonderful and very funny movie

 The Characters are great, But the actual film isn't.

 It has its flaws but it is also extremely entertaining and one of the Coen Brothers' best films.

 Overpraised like most cult clasics.

 What makes a man?

 Beautiful, Warm and Hilariously Funny.

 Very Good!

 The Best Movie Ever

 Watch it for more than five times, and you will find out why.

 Perfection
