 Awful, AWFUL Film

 Plan 9 From Outer Space as alleged history

 Bad History, Bad Drama.

 Historically inaccurate and overrated

 Such a stupid film.

 Another fine mess from Mel Gibson

 Horrible

 I don't see why everyone likes this movie so much

 Oh my god, howlingly bad

 Let he whose country is without sin cast the first stone.

 Terrible movie.

 Idiotic, two dimensional, anti historic claptrap

 Complete Rubbish
