 The last two minutes of the entire season sucked! **CAUTION Spoiler Alert!**

 Really? That's the Best You Could Do?

 Funny light comedy. But Mrs doesn't give a dime about her kids

 So good

 Season 2 falls short

 I Wanted to Like This More

 Didn't hit the ground running but...

 Second season is disappointing

 Good watch but suspend belief

 The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel: Joan Rivers... but not Joan Rivers???

 Loved season 1, hated the ending of 2

 Amy Sherman drops again

 Fun and frolics in a byegone era

 Borstein, Shaloub, Pollack? IDEAL CAST!

 Entertaining sure, but Marvelous...

 This TV Show could be much better

 Brillaint visual marred by an unpleasant sound track
