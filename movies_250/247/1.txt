I did not feel offended by any of the things related to god.Everyone has a perspective of looking at a religion there is nothing right or wrong in that.My main concern was the movie as a whole.It felt as if this movie was made to give a Tribute to Aamir Khan.For example Boman Irani is such a great actor but he was only like a prop in the film. There was nothing in the movie which touched by heart as a whole unlike other films of Rajkumar Hirani which kept me thinking about it even after going out of the movie theater.There were some scenes which were irritating and not even funny and were just put to show the whole world of why Aamir khan is such a great actor.The songs were like children's poem.I just want to tell everyone that don't blindly appreciate whatever he does,he is not always right and perfect.If this movie was made with a new comer it surely would have bombed at the box office.The movie didn't have a particular story to keep you edged at the seats,things just kept happening with a few laughs here and there.There are so much better movies made which don't get that appreciation because of the small star cast and low marketing.


                
I was surprised that RKH and AK did a movie like this...this movie was nothing but a collection of cliché's..I mean, things like a girl from India falling in love with a guy from Pakistan..donno why they stopped there..why not someone from afganistan?? or a let militant??? then there is the alien -mr AK who look like an alien anyways, I mean literally without costume J(actually Anushka also looks like one after the new lip job!!)..and there are stupid pathetic jokes like pasting stickers of Hindu gods on the face and saying it is self defense...I mean you must be a idiot to laugh at that.. I liked OMG a million times more..it was a movie that was shot sensibly and made sense..this movie is just cheesy..at the end of the movie you will be left wondering if this movie was a alien movie or a love story or something else...Imagine mixing pizza, ice-cream, pickle and tamarind paste and eating it at once..what would be the aftertaste?? This movie is like that..Don't waste your money on this...get a copy of ET and OMG and watch it back to back..
I felt inclined to write a review for this film, only to help a random reader in realizing that THE IMDb SCORE, IN THIS CASE, REPRESENTS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I can't even imagine how socially damaged a person must be in order to find this amusing, funny or controversial in any way. It's full of clichés, starting with this need Indian movies have nowadays to shoot some part in Europe or any other candy-eye setting, even though it plays no role and it's completely out of context. The script is embedded in a corny emotional discourse and jokes are funny only because they lead you to think they were written by the fart of a 3 year old mentally retarded royal family member that has been fed with pop corn his whole life. Technically it's flawless, like a Korean music video, with good cinematography, but absolutely no substance. I don't know if the high score is due to a marketing campaign or the utter lack of taste and/or intellect of its fan base.


                
Few examples about the lost plot.......People enjoying PK possibly could also enjoy the movies like Joker or Tees Mar khan.No originality's in humor (Filled with vulgarity), instead audience laughs on realizing the value of this movie.Amir Khan, please stop making nonsense copies of a far better scripted movies like (OMG), as you did with Dhoom-3 (copied from The Prestige and Now You See Me).The fact that Sushant Singh calls Pakistan Embassy in Belgium everyday, it self makes it a totally lost plot. Additionally, Boman Irani and his firm getting the Live debate was making me bang my head.


                
First half was filled with comedy. But the entire plot derailed in second half when the movie lost its humor and was more or less illogical and focused mainly on defending Muslims and asking stupid questions like "Is religion is written on the body of a person?". Religion is something of an ideology rather than a physical mark! But almost entire second half was revolved around this question and was bent on defending Muslims on this ground. It deserves 0 stars but I am forced to give 1 star.This movie also reminds me of 3 idiots in the sense that the first half was excellent while the second half was filled with utter nonsense like making delivery of pregnant woman at home using batteries and TV instructions! Amir Khan looks like he is losing the grip over his movies. His recent movies have been totally disappointing


                
There is huge controversy surrounding this movie so i decided to watch it. After watching this movie i found that movie really has some controversial scenes which should not be there. I don't know how censor passed this movie. Some of the controversial scenes are 1)" Aamir khan putting gods sticker on his face and comparing with saving walls from p*ssing. 2) Continuously ridiculing stone worshiping by cracking joke like battery is down in God, How much cost of this God. One more scene where Aamir fought with a man which was in God shankar get up. These were all in regard to controversies now question is whether this film delivers? The answer is a big NO. This movie neither entertaining nor has any social message. I think director made this movie controversial deliberately so that film can be successful There is no logic in the Movie. If you go by acting Aamir scored a big zero, Anishka is OK, only good part is Saurabh shukla. Some of the goofs of the Movie(which this movie is fulled of but i am naming only few): 1)Anushka(Hindu) girl loves Sushant (Pakistani Muslim man) and decided to marry in church. 2)Aamir an alien falls in love with a human(anushka). 3) Anushka and sushant broke up while reading a letter which they thought sent by the other(Now thats i call a stupidity). More stupidity its Alien Aamir who got to know after reading Anishka mind with touch but wait a minute how Aamir got to know who has written the letter and how sarfaraz was innocent. he can only read Anushka mind not sarfaraz. Thats director left it on the public.


                
This is an opportunistic movie with no morals... the crew act as they are brave to mock religion but in reality they are the most coward. They make fun of the religion which welcomes criticism, and that is hinduism. I can imagine what would have happened if the make fun of some other religion. They don't want to die. My only problem is when they say its a movie on social cause.Don't they know 1 billion people have following the religion are the happiest among the world, they never kill anyone. Accepts everybody who gave them respect.I was expecting a movie which would show how to use religion for a better life and world benefit.My verdict is * as i spent Rs.300 for the ticket, and the star is for my judgment to buy the ticket only. I cant understand how walking like a child is good acting.


                
Ammir and the film producer Hirani are completely out of line in this movie. The movie is pro-Muslim and Pro-Pakistan and at the same time Anti- Hindu and and Anti-India. Who else but Muslim actors would make a hindu bashing movie like this?? The IMDb rating of 4 and above is fake. I would not give it even a star. They ignore the harsh reality in this world. Which is? Muslims and fanatic Islamists butchering people all over the world. This movie shows Hindus in a very negative way. There are thousands of fake Muslims peers and babas in India plying their trade. Why? Because India is a democracy. This anti-Indian movie needs to be banned and the actors need to be sent on a one way trip to the country that funded this movie....Pakistan. Looks like they will fit in fine with the fanatics over there who blindly hate hindus and anyones not Muslim. Muslims have a thousand year history of barbarism and treason in the country. Starting as sporadic invaders, Muslims slowly usurped entire lands, kingdoms and wealth. The destroyed over million of temples and built mosques over them. Trouble with the educated Muslim clean shaven jihadist is they don't talk publicly about their views but they are deep rooted to the jihadist ideology and can go any extent to support the violent causes as prescribed in the Islam. Looks like this movie was funded by Mullahs. AVOID!!!


                
I really hate giving any movie a bad review but i have to make a exception for this film. I recently read a news article reporting that PK has entered IMDb top 250 list. I wish this was a glitch in IMDb's algorithm or else the quality of IMDb has dropped to a new low. As a lover for good cinema I am in my strong opinion that this film has no outstanding acting, direction or story which will allow it to be the top film (250) of all time. The story of this film is mediocre with nothing exceptional in it. The worst part of this film is the direction. Comparing to Rajkumar Hirani's other film, this film is poorly directed and i blame him alone for this bad review.


                
I always considered Amir as best of 3 khans & he did give good movies like Sarforosh or 3 idiots. Than came Dhoom 3 & I was shocked to see Amir's bad acting. I still thought maybe this is masala picture & his heart was not there. Now I saw PK & I am convinced that I overrated Amir earlier. To his credit, its probably hard to act good when you are asked to keep your eyes wide open like a Tarsier throughout the film. The premise of film is good but it was shown in pathetic & boring way. OMG was much better with similar plot. Of course, Amir & Hirani is more interested in showing following things, rather than acting or cinematography :1. Hindu rituals are mostly pervert & superstitious. Well, I could have digested it if Amir KHAN bothered to show similar flaws in Islam. Oh, but he wont dare to do so - because next day he will get a fatwa. Everyone knows hindus are easy target.2. Pakis are really guys with golden heart. It is Indians (especially hindus) who misunderstand them. This mentality is the only thing blocking brotherhood between pakis & Indians! 3. As a alien sent from (naturally) advanced planet, Amir lands nude, don't have any backup means of communication with his planet. And he is as dumb as donkey - when it comes to understanding the life in earth. I guess one fine morning alien specis just thought of sending a spaeship to earth without doing any reasearch!there are plenty of such flaws. Watch this movie if you have few hundred rupees & few hours to waste.


                
What is wrong with people of India? Movie had no logic. PK understood what a receipt is but didn't know what a GOD's idol is.Additionally, he learned the language from a whore but didn't know what a condom is. That's foolish. OMG was far better than this movie. Hindu rituals are mostly pervert & superstitious. Well, I could have digested it if Amir KHAN bothered to show similar flaws in Islam. Oh, but he wont dare to do so - because next day he will get a fatwa. Everyone knows Hindus are easy targetActually it's a LUL movie. Amir's long run of good movie making has come to a pause or stop. Disappointed with Amir. First Dhoom 3 and now PK. It definitely didn't deserve 300 core. Not at all worthy of being the biggest grossing Bollywood movie. This movie is fools gold.
So much awaited movie of d year turn into worst movie..Typical Bollywood drama flick. this was not been expected from d makers of 3 idiots .. Although Actors has played there part very well but d soul part of movie is purity and specific delivery of subject was missing throughout the film..I don't know they had made a film which is already been super hit and liked.. and d way of interpreting the subject was so poor and predictable..please try to avoid it.. worst experience. don't waste your time in listening Bihari from alien... it will be d worst moment for Steven Spielberg who had started d trend of making movies on alien... now they can also speak bhojpuri..stop it ..people are not so dumb these days...


                
"Secularism doesn't mean abuse the majority!" Someone aptly tweeted this few days back! The movie is good but it's few scenes that really stand out as offensive. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, you went too far this time. What you find comic, may not strike cord with everyone! You made a person playing Shiva (stage play), to run like a coward. Do you have guts to do the same to someone playing Prophet Mohammad or Jesus Christ made to run in same way and show cowardice! No! Because you'll be called nonsecular! The comparison between OMG and PK was inevitable as both movies tread the same path.However, OMG was a lot better than this one. I have watched OMG multiple times, and each time it got better. With PK, I can only say that it's one good time watch.Some people are saying that PK is Aamir's best performance! I seriously doubt that. Lagaan and 3 Idiots are miles ahead in terms of his performance.The movie boasts of some really good scenes. And yes, I enjoyed it in parts. But it failed to make the same impact that OMG did with me.Just because Hindus are tolerant and accept criticism, not every other movie should bash it. I mean, cmon. Had it been any other religion, you wouldn't have lived to see the light of another day. Please be gentle to all religions equally!


                
1. Blatant copy of Billy Connelly's The Man Who Sued God.2. Please note, OH MY GOD (PARESH RAWAL) was also a blatant copy of the same movie.3. PK is also loosely based on Kevin Spacey starrer K-Pac ( not much but the character placement)4. I am still trying to understand what was the producer, director and writer trying to convey ?5. Boman Irani is wasted, Why was Sanjay Dutt cast in the movie.6. I mean literally is that all is left now to show ? 7. Has Anushka Sharma taken a botox injection on her upper lip ?8. Tell me again what and where is the story ?9. OK from which planet did Aamir Khan came from ?10. I want my money back for sure.Indian Audience should really stop making such foolish movies hit, there are many meaningful cinemas coming in theatre, go watch them. Why waste money and time on such dumbo movies, wait for a month and this movie will be aired in Sony Max along with Suryavansham.8.8 rating on IMDb ? What non-sense is this.


                
*** This review may contain spoilers ***This review is not going to be about the popular debate that had ensued about how this movie belittles religious feelings.This is about how the story unfolds. Seeing 8+ ratings, I was mislead to believe that this is a well made and thoughtful movie. Since there are a ton of other good movies that carry 8+ ratings on IMDb, and deserve it, PK certainly doesn't fall into that category.**Spoilers**1. Predictable - within a couple of minutes, any intelligent movie goer would be able to predict that when the lead actress received a letter that was not signed, it is indeed not for her. She doesn't call this person, the other person doesn't call her and then everything just vines together during a live TV show. 2. An alien species that knows how to build space ships, will hang a remote on the person going for a first contact to an alien land, instead of somehow embedding it into the person's body. In clear view. Up for grabs by the first ruffian the alien comes by. This is an insult to intellectual movie enthusiasts.3. What was the objective of the alien? Just to get his remote stolen and then find it? You get one chance to connect with another species, and then you waste it by crying about a lost remote. Further, the concept of God is something that the alien suddenly not only understand, but starts believing in (during the TV show, he makes a comment about this). I am going off the rails here.Of course, the movie was about delivering a message, but when you are about to gross INR 500 Crores (something that 99.99% of the Indian population hasn't even seen), isn't it worth it to put extra efforts to come up with a better and intelligent vehicle to deliver it?I applaud the Indian public for seeing past all these deficiencies and focusing on the message. I couldn't do so.It seems..mostly people of India Liked this movie...
The movie has no logic, no emotional angle worth relating to, and no new concept. If you take movies like Koi Mil Gaya, Oh My God, 3 Idiots, K-PAX, etc and remove all the good things from them, and then blend the leftovers, u end up with PK. It doesn't have the magic or the emotional impact of Koi Mil Gaya. It doesn't have the novelty or the wit or the dialogues of Oh My God. It doesn't have the funny scenes or the fundas of 3 Idiots. Seems Hirani just took money from Belgium tourism and Rajasthan tourism, coz those places had basically nothing to do with the film's story(not really a story anyway. Arbaaz Khan can tell a better story than this one).Rajkumar Hirani may walk away with the best director award(if the award judging panel is as dumb as some of the comments) for this film, but he is sure to lose many of his fans who admired his craft in his previous three films. The only person who holds this flimsy story together on screen is Anushka Sharma. Aamir is a mixture of cuteness and irritation. And at this stage of his career, not really a memorable performance from him. Sushant Singh, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla, etc have nothing to do in this film, and they do a good job of it. "kahaa hai re tu bhagwaan", movie PK dec 2014 "mere nishaan hai kahaan". movie OMG sep 2012You choose, whichever is better. PK isn't really that funny, isn't really that novel, isn't really a romantic movie, doesn't have much drama or thrills. No locales, no characters worth remembering. no scenes that touch your heart. No songs that can help propel the film. PK is like a seven course meal, that has no main dish. just starters and deserts.
was expecting a good logical movie... but it targets Hinduism. granted every religion, even Hinduism, is flawed in some way, the movie depicts every aspect of Hinduism as bad. and anything remotely related to Pakistan to be good. i don't know if the movie was made as a hidden plea to Pakistan or ISIS so they don't attack India in the near future. throwing in something(just a bit) about other religions to avoid controversy was very clever by the makers. so was getting a Hindu actor to play the part of the Pakistani boy. scene of the Pakistani boy in the Pakistani embassy was out of a dream, literally, as that never happens in reality. maybe they wanted to bash every religion but realized that it can't be done without the movie getting banned in many states. hence the majority of the movie targets Hindus as they are the most tolerant(and stupid) and had learn the art of "non-violence" from Gandhi. the movie goes on to praise Islam like never before. the title PK is the domain(WWW.Pakistan. pk) of the country Pakistan, what more can you ask as proof. Amir was previously famous for making movies which were the most realistic (with respect to other Bollywood movies), but D3 was a disgrace and now PK is downright dumb and disrespectful and fake. I along with many of his previous fans, have lost all faith in him.


                
Pk Movie: PK is a too lengthy...too many songs.. and loose end story  with great bits of funny jokes. But, the worst part of the movie is  that, it has spend most of the time and energy in dismantling and  disrespecting Hinduism. Aamir Khan either had no guts to talk bad or  focus on his own religion Islam and others. When the burning issue all  over the world are many issues related to his own religion. Idol  worship is bad or don't donate to a temple ! is the feel i get when i  left the movie hall. Just because Hindu's are tolerant in self  criticism doesn't mean, you take the easy way out. The movie should  focus on the agenda that No God is Big or Small and let everyone leave  in peace. Not, that one way of living is bad and another way is good.  Aamir Khan indirectly supported the Islamic thinking of non-idol  worship. And not only that , Pakistani Muslim guy and a Hindu girl. So,  no matter what Pakistan does to India based on religious grounds , no  matter what terrorist attack they do, we should marry Hindu Indian  girls to Pakistani Guy. Wow!! Good job Aamir.  Pakistani News Channel gave it 5/5 Obviously:


                
Both of you are not supposed to hurt Indian sentiments. Who told you that superstitions are found only in Hinduism, rather it is found in other religions also. The superstitions found in others will not let the people to live, especially ladies, but in ours, it leads a way to life, the hopes that it gives, could not be called as superstitions.Being an Indian, first learn to respect Indian culture.Only in India cows are considered as God. Is it not great?, but you have shown it as a foolish thing,... .....Shame on you......If there is a little bit of patriotism in you, don't take this kind of movies.


                
I was very excited to watch this movie as it's Aamir - Hirani movie. Starting was good, I was enjoying the movie until they started bashing Hindu Gods and Godmen in this movie. As a Hindu and Indian, I was very embarrassed to see this movie as this movie was forcing it's viewers to accept that Pakistani men are always trustworthy and Hindu Godmen are thugs. They pushed it very hard by showing Shiva as very fearful god and many Gods as Missing. It was more of like Oh My God were an atheist question's Gods existence. As they can't dare to criticize Islam by a human being they brought in Alien to bash religions and Godmen. What a cheap thought by our bollywood giants like Rajkumar hirani and Aamir khan. I will never watch movies from Aamir Khan now as if he wanted he could have always stopped this non- sense in his movie.Questions to movie makers and aam aadmi who watched this movie: - Do you really need a Pakistani guy with Hindu Indian girl to make the story secular? Why can't you take Pakistani girl and Hindu Indian guy? You fear your life for that? - Why you keep bashing Hindu gods and never dare to do so for other religions? Do you want to show that Hindus are impotent? - Why do you want to make FUN of religions by an alien? Because you knew that what you are doing is NOT GOOD and not acceptable by humans.Overall, I was so much hurt by watching my God running for His life by some alien, my Godmen kept on bashing by some alien, Pakistani guy is shown faithful and honest and my Godmen is shown as Thug. Wake up India, they are punching you in your heart and you are praising it!! Are we so much liberal to accept this? NO, we are impotent to even touch them!
Alien movie? seriously? It mocks the whole genre.. Pay attention to these points about the movie: 1. If PK was so advanced why couldn't his race develop clothes? 2. He was so advanced yet he couldn't invent a smaller remote for his ship.. we are a lot better than as humans 3. Anushka looked so ugly and irritating in the movie.. Just opposite to what she was in Rab ne bana di jodi.. Lip job made hee look worse 4. None of the plot of the movie was real, Pakistanis are trustworthy? seriously? Filmmaker acted like he never met pakistanis 5. I do not have any problem in making fun of God if it's done impartially.. but PK enters temple, church but couldn't even reach mosque's vicinity? That's unbelievable 6. PK transferred language skills from a prostitute but after that couldn't identify condom in a scene.. i mean wtf? u think we are dumb?There are countless flaws in PK, I can go on and on.. all and all this movie is pathetic if seen with impartial mind and international standards.
I don't understand why this movie has targeted certain section of society I would say movie is disastrous and Ammir khan as an actor has lost his goodwill among-st larger section of Indian society I would say movie is disastrous and Ammir khan as an actor has lost his goodwill among-st larger section of Indian society This will be evident in his future movies This will be evident in his future moviesMovie surrounds around targeting one sections of society where as praising elements which are real issues in today's world which seemed very unrealistically plottedMovie surrounds around targeting one sections of society where as praising elements which are real issues in today's world which seemed very unrealistically plotted


                
This movie was supposed to be the most awaited movie of the year.But it turned out to be one of the worst movie of the year.Yup, there will be people and pseudo intellectuals who will go gaga over it.But not me.These wannabe intellectuals will praise it just because they want to ride a bandwagon and feel cool about it. Aamir Khan disappoints once again after Mindless Dhoom 3 and ruins another Christmas for Me.Hope Aamir will sign good movies again.We want to see something like Tare Zameen par or Rang de Basanti.But it looks like even he only wants to earn movies.Please Aamir we still have hopes from you.So please don't do such hopeless movies again. Sadly Munnabhai and 3 idiots still remains Rajkumar Hiranis best work.


                
Uttler bullshit movie.Everyone claims the movie criticizes all religions equally. My ass!They go to a point that they show a Hindu god in a humiliating condition in a toilet. But these losers don't even go inside a mosque. In what way is that a level headed criticism of religion? Amir khan has really lived up to his surname it looks like. Intellectual, my ass! Son of a bee otch wouldn't dare to make this movie in any Muslim country. I don't know what this guy's problem is. Hope he gets ass cancer and lives long enough and his life becomes a living hell.


                
I so much looked forward to watching this film. I love Aamir Khan as an actor and his films such as Taalash and Ghajni are simply awesome.So I sat down with my popcorn to watch this. Credits role.Alien I see. It's sci-fi. Brilliant. I love sci-fi. Then it changes. It's an alien learning earthly ways. It changes again, it's an alien challenging the absurdity of religion. I thought YESSSS!!! India a country drunk with religion needs to be sobered up.What followed next was sooooo disappointing. Cliché. Vomit inducing love story. Clumsy dialogue with pseudo logic.OK let me tell you my problem. If a film like this wants to challenge religion then you have to get to the heart of the matter. Let me give you examples.Cue Pakistani Muslim in Love with Hindu Indian girl. Moral at end Pakistani Muslim men are respectful of women. Errr actually there is an inherent problem within Islam that treats Kafir women as fair game. Cue the 1500 abuse case of underage girl in Rotherman, UK. Other Pakistani Muslim abuse gangs in the UK? A coincidence? - The film should have challenged the misogynistic nature of Islam.Another example. Cue Hindu man pointing finger at Christian priest for conversion. No mention of the fact that the caste system which is the central basis of Hinduism and treats low caste people like chattels maybe reason why people convert.Another example - cue the Christian man - they touch briefly on the Christian conversion as an open thing that Christians do. No mention of the underhand tactics used by American and UK missionaries to go and convert people.Cue the Sikh - no mention of the fundamentalist strain that is infiltrating Sikhism. No mention of the corruption that is creeping into the Gurudwara's. No mention of the Baba's that are putting a blight on the philosophy of Nanak, that specifically requires people not to have a living person as a Guru.I could go on ad infinitum.For me the film is not cutting enough. The mush with the idiotic Pakistani - Indian love story ruined it for me, which turned into some sort of mystery that had to be solved by the lovable alien detective PK. The flaws in religion and religious thinking are far more fundamental than this and cannot be sugar coated like this.Love doesn't conquer all I'm afraid. Logic and Reason conquers all.You missed a trick Rajkumer Hindani!!
