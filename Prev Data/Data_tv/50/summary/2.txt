 Terrible terrible ending

 It would have been better if Netflix had left it unfinished.

 What a Disappointment

 season 6 is really bad damage control season

 My ability to suspend disbelief is shot.

 Series Three Sucks

 It is gone to a low quality mess

 What a fall.

 Not good!!

 Netflix, masters at watering down content!

 Ultra feminists overtaking the White House

 Season 3 is hideously disappointing

 NOT FOR THE THINKER. Plots are obvious, people are too stupid.

 Seasons are a steady slide from excellent to a complete waste of time

 A long wait for a LOUSY storyline

 I must be in the major minority here...

 Hackneyed, clichéd, trite, a Soap Opera in Suits

 Original Series Totally Ruined

 Why did you ruin this with Season 6

 Daytime soap?

 The bold and the

 Season 6

 Season Three was Garbage

 Weak intellectual integrity

 so i have finished the series and it finished me
