 boring good guys, disgusting bad guys, impotent fantasy creatures, lovingly rendered torture effects

 Still trying to understand the Hype....

 A weird and wonderful film, but sadly not one I could get into

 Beautiful pictures and state of art scenes, depressed and poor performance, irrationally illogical plot

 Fascism bad! No, the movie is.

 Not the movie the ads would have you believe

 Del Toro Loses Focus

 Stupid and pointless

 Massively overrated.

 How do people NOT find this typical?

 What is it about?

 Utterly Depressing. Not Enough Fantasy Sequences

 I didn't get it

 Simply crap

 Pans Double Sided Labyrinth (www.spinandstir.com)

 Subtitles do not a masterpiece make...

 A film of little to no substance.

 Over-hyped and flawed, but not exactly bad

 Disappointing

 my review for pan's labyrinth

 The center cannot hold

 Unnecessary graphic violence

 This was very disappointing

 a waste of talent, actors, time and money

 Making faun of Spain's Civil War
