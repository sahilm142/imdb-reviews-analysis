 Remove the Blinkers.

 It really isn't that good.

 I really can't understand why people love this

 Funny huh?

 This show sucks

 i like, soooooooooo didn't see that joke coming

 Torturous

 Not Ready for Prime Time

 I am shocked people like this.

 Seinfeld the greatest show there was and will be

 Stereotype city! A Dumber, Sentimental version of Seinfeld. Show for Kids, and Morons.

 Went on for too long

 Like the show, but one character ruins that

 HIGHLY OVERRATED

 This show has a very friendly, unearned rating.
