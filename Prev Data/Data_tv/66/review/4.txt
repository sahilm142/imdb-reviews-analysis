The West Wing was (Like MASH) shameless liberal Democrat propaganda in the guise of political melodrama designed to make conservatives look like almost exclusively like blood-thirsty, conniving morons.Convincing yet over-the-top portrayals of Republican politicians given by solid actors like John Goodman and James Brolin went a long way towards persuading Americans that Republicans are at best misguided but generally insane or inbred.The acting was almost uniformly exceptional but the entertainment value was minimal except for liberals who enjoyed seeing the GOP get made to look like obnoxious buffoons every week.If was very effective in transmitting its message.
