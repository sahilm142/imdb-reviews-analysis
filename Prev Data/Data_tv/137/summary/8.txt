 Once upon a time in Kentucky...

 I said to myself:well,a new a Deadwood ,I wasn't wrong completely,but it is more fun,faster, and maybe even better

 Not bad, let's see where it goes

 Why Justified Died in Season Five

 In spite of long duration and sporadic unevenness, still a quality entertainment

 Quite an entertaining TV series, justice in the coal-mining country.

 Third run of Justified takes the show for a plunge in quality

 This serie is an undiscovered by the masses classic

 Was great for awhile.

 Very impressed and surprised so far

 Intriuging

 If you liked Banshee, you're gonna love this too!

 Niche Show, seemingly in decline after distancing itself from the original premise

 Characters and Locations

 It is all about the badge . . .

 Great until series five then loses it's way...

 Genuine

 Violent but fascinating.
