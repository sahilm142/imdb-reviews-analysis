To go straight to the point, I was not impressed. This film is currently at #130 out of IMDb's top 250 list and to me is extremely overrated. It wasn't that bad of a film, it is just not very enjoyable or appealing to watch. It brought up some interesting topics and philosophies but was really not that deep or intellectual as many claim. I liked the symbolism of a man interacting with Death and the excellent scene of the plagued people and their march through the town, but the majority of the film was simply dull, dreary, and boring. I have a feeling that it is rated so highly because of a strong atheist or agnostic following simply because of the subject matter not based on the film itself.


                
This may be because I've seen other 'talks with Death' movies such as Meet Joe Black, but I find this movie as mediocre at best. Yes the world depiction hit its mark very well, making the audience feel like they sunk into the gloomy world. But for me that's because the whole black and white color and the recurrence of the Death character. The main plot with Blok feels like it'll make this movie a challenging watch to those who pride their faith. What made me rate it a score f 4 is the sub plots that makes this movie look simply stupid. Again maybe this is a cultural gap issue between me and 1950s Sweden, but I fail to understand how Plog's stupidity can have a good impact to the whole story. One thing to add is that I tend to agree with the opinion about the acting. Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot did a splendid job in their roles here that helped a lot in setting up the movie's mood.
