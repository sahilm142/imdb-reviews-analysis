 Not sure I saw the same movie that people are raving about...

 Another overrated movie from marvel

 Critical thinking is Extinct !!

 Generel (de)preciation: lots of good material, but unfortunately not brought together well

 Target Audience: Low IQ Adults and Children Under 8

 So-so on all levels

 If you like..

 Turdmasters Of The Universe!

 Grossly overrated

 Nothing New

 I've Played Video Games That Make Better Movies Than This Stinker

 So many reasons

 Guardians of the Galaxy was a disappointment.

 Sci-Fi that oozes blandness

 Overrated and hyped - Slapstick humor vs Storyline

 perfectly and witty made propaganda

 Nice Try

 I was hoping for more

 Lots of CGI and Action

 Struggling to stay awake

 Probably at a time when they need to change their formula

 Couldn't Save Us

 An okay sci-fi adventure with lazy attempts at style.

 Weak script, lazy direction or poor characters?

 Rocket Raccoon: Well he don't know talkin' good like me and you, so his vocabulistics is limited to "I" and "am" and "Groot," exclusively in that order.
