Less than 2 years ago, we received another batch of David Attenborough-hosted and narrated (and BBC-produced) nature documentaries in "Plane Earth II", and now already comes a new round in the form of "Blue Planet II", which is of course the sequel to the original "Blue Planet" series from 2001, yes almost 2 decades ago. In the opening moments of "One Ocean", the first episode of "Blue Planets II", Attenborough explains that since 2001, there has been a breakthrough both in science and in technology as to the filing of life in the oceans, and hence the time has come to revisit the 'blue planet".Couple of comments: while I've had an HD TV for a couple of years, it's only been about a year that I actually get all my TV channels in high definition, and what a difference this has made. The photography in "Blue Planet II" is so amazing, it's like sitting IN the water and experiencing it in person. I honestly can't think of another documentary series that features this kind of jaw-dropping photography. And while the photography gets all of the acclaim, kudos to the documentary makers for bringing us some fascinating stories as such (check out the fish that breaks open the clam shell, "all without hands" adds Attenborough jokingly, or the devastating effects of the shrinking ice cover in the Arctic on the walrus, especially the females who need to provide places to rest to their young ones, etc. etc.). Yes, the documentary makes do address climate change but it's done in a very respectful way."One Ocean" premiered this past weekend, and thankfully "Blue Planet II" has 6 more episodes to go ("The Deep", "Coral Reefs", "Big Blue", "Green Seas", "Coasts", and "Our Blue Planet"). Episodes originally airs 9 pm on Saturdays on BBC America, and then available On Demand (at least on Spectrum), and of course are also available on Amazon Instant Video. If you love or enjoy nature documentaries, you should absolutely not miss this. "Blue Planet II" is a WINNER.
