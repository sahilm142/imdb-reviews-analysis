This movie was shot in only 4 weeks, and Claudette Colbert said it was the worst movie she had ever made. Of course she knew what she was talking about.The usual sexual fantasies in Capra's catholic perverted mind come here in the fashion of a millionaire's daughter fairytale. The ridiculous, childish dialogs (except, of course, when it is about sex,), the multitude of goofs, mistakes, failures and, as a whole, a non-sense story plagued with out of time -humour? and mystical love, makes this one of the most disgusting movies in the history of cinema, to my taste.Now Clark Gable can be completely wasted, then perfectly sober one minute later, that's never been a problem in Capra's movies. Being drunk is funny, of course. Also the bus driver can be transformed into a different actor after a song has been sung, Is it a miracle? Is it a goof? This movie is SO bad, who cares any more?
So... It was a talkie... I think it would have been better scilent.The videography of the movie was fine... but the idea of the movie just wasn't for me.The transition from seen to sceen was well done and the movie had some great actors.I'm not a fan of the directors other works either. I guess its just his style that throws me off.It was one of those movies that was way to far out there for me to enjoy.If you don't like movies with "dumb" type of characters don't see this movie.


                
The whole time I watched this movie, I waited for some action. What did I get? A terrible metaphor. I was blue balled for an hour and forty-five minutes. 1 star, I would rate lower if I could.
