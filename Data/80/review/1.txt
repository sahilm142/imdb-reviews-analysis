I take this movie at face value and come to the conclusion that it is pretty good.  Thats all.  Just pretty good. I have a few reasons for this. First of all, the storyline is not very good.  A guy is killing kids.  As a result, the police crack down leading to a loss in money for organized crime.  Ok, I can accept that....but when bosses of organized crime turn to the beggars union? Beggar's what?!  The plot line is barely developed. Little tension is built.  The only disturbing aspect is the introduction, after that little is done to build the character of Peter Lorre as threatening character.  He's is immediately discovered by a blind balloon salesmen.  From then on its the underworld figuring out what to do with him. The trial scene is supposed to be big and emotional.  Its completely laughable in every way.  The mock trial?  This makes no sense and is completely unbelievable.The "intense" filming is nothing more than a shot of a ball rolling which hints the girl was killed.  Thats the only innovative camera work in the whole film.  That does not impress me at all, noer does the character of peter lorre.  His acting is the redeeming point of the movie.  However, his character is not built at all.  The only development is at the end in the trial scene which is too late for me to feel any feelings for what he has to say and too little to make up for the lack up untill this point.
The message of the movie is weak and scetchy.  I can however appreciate the fact that this movie was made in 1941....meaning it was a pioneer in the subject of schitzophrania.Although, this movie stands not as a movie with a message but as a plot driven mystery thriller.  For having such a poor plot, little is accomplished.  This film is a poor showing compared to earlier works such as Metropolis.  6/10
