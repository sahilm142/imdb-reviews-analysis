I had always wondered what this show was about since a little kid and one day i watched 3 episodes and immediately got addicted i always wanted to know what would happen next. If you're judging the show by its animation you shouldn't be, it has a wonderful and creative story which can get nearly anyone to keep watching. It has many creative settings and characters each with their own dreams and beliefs. The show starts to really get good after the water 7 arc. Some characters can be very goofy and the show's the pacing is very slow but that doesn't really matter since it has a very compelling and amazing story and attachable characters especially the main characters Overall i really recommend this show if you want something fun and interesting and if you do want to get into it. you will have to watch 5 a week day and 10 on weekends to catch up to where it is now..


                
The series is excellent. But 1 thing who the hell would watch a series for 25 years ?? I am watching the series from past 5 years .. and its not even completed half (i guess) So the director should have in mind ..like who will watch it for these many years, It would be better if its on weekends (2days) and 1 hour per day. So it would be completed soon (not less than 5 years)One Piece follows the dumb-but-strong-and-spirited Monkey D. Luffy in the pursuit of his dream--to become king of the pirates. Not because he's hungry for power, but rather because he is hungry for freedom! He looks up to pirates who are not the typical villains you might think of. Luffy gives pirates a good name, at least with the people he meets and helps along the way.On his journeys, Luffy recruits a diverse, yet small crew, each with their own dream. Despite having different goals and the fact they don't always seem to get along, the crew is dedicated and will put their lives on the line for their crew-mates.


                
First of all I have watched all of the episodes and I'm waiting for the 703 episode i haven't read the manga yet but I'm planning to read it. Lets start One piece is one of the best action, adventure anime that you can find. It may be boring at the start like first 70-80 episodes can be boring but stay and watch it gets very epic later on. There will be Epic fights but you need to wait like 100 episodes to see another epic fight but its worth the wait . If i compare One piece to Naruto or Bleach, One piece would win but barely, Bleach would be 2 and Naruto would be 3.Hey but its my opinion maybe Naruto for you would be 1, Bleach 2 and One piece 3. I suggest One piece to everyone who likes action and adventure anime and if you like long anime this is the one you need to watch, it now has about 705 episodes and it won't be the end for like 500 episodes.That my opinion about One piece it is my favorite anime and its worth watching. :)


                
-Luffy is a freak who never dies, even if yiu stab him in the face.
-Zoro is an outstanding swordsman.
-Nami is very notorious for fooling others.
-Usopp is a coward and an excellent gunman.
-Sanji is a ladies' man.Deadpool is an excellent swordsman, deadshot gunman, excels at fooling people, never dies and is a ladies' man.I really wonder whether Mr. Oda never knew of Deadpool or Marvel never knew of One Piece.
