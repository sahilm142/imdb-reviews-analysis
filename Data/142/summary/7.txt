 Not Beautifully Mined

 A disappointment

 Good but overrated biopic

 A beautiful biopic

 Though designed to be prestigious, the beauty does manage to come through

 .....really beautiful

 Crowe steals the show

 Better Than Average Genius Movie: A Beautiful MindI

 Much better than I expected

 Admirable and extremely well made, if just missing the mark of a "great" film

 Very confusing movie ..

 A mathematical genius heart set on achieving his goal of creating an original theory battles with what may or may not be real.

 Hypekill.

 An unusually complex and adventurous Hollywood biopic.

 "A" for Acting, "B" for Story, "C" for Accuracy <U+0096> that adds up to a "B", right?

 A Beautiful Melodrama

 Good

 Definitely an intelligent moving film, even if it does betray its Hollywood origin

 Complex on many levels and definitely worth seeing

 A cliché

 Too much syrup in the end.

 Triumph of the Spirit

 Russell Crowe Can Act?

 The Vidiot Reviews...

 A good film, but a terrible biopic
