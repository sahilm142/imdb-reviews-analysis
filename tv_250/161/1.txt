Everyone has been raving about this series but I just cannot get past Episode 3 in Season 1. The 'plot' has become completely absurd and totally unrealistic. The D.C.I. would have been suspended as he was a suspect in a murder. And then he goes missing for an hour after being kidnapped chasing the villains and nobody insists he explains where he was. Very disappointing script.
This series doesn't represent real issues in the UK. The representation of the police is false and ludicrous in the extreme. In 20 years working with criminals and police nothing like this has ever emerged in the conduct of any police. It totally misrepresents what police are like and the crime scene in the UK. What is depicted is a peedo ring and revenge is taken on them by a rogue police officer who ejaculates into the mouth of a peedo and then beheads him...but then befriends the victims puppy. We are led to believe that, but for the peedos, the rogue police officer would have had a lovely life with a bookish, sweet lady and had a puppy of his own.This just doesn't happen in real life anywhere, let alone the UK. The program may represent a national hysteria against peedos which has swept in pretty much any gray haired man over the age of 60 who has had an illicit or allegedly illicit relationship with a child, of either sex, or another man, at any time in their lives going back to the Kennedy assassination. What it has to do with crime or policing or "entertainment" I don't know.
