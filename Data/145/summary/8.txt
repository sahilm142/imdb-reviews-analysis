 Anger begets more anger

 mixed bag

 A nice change of pace from universe destruction films

 An enjoyable, unique movie!

 Violence begets violence

 Liked it very much.

 Brilliant

 Comedy, tragedy and morality rolled into one

 what's the law on what ya can and can't say on a billboard..

 The Human Side of the Small Town

 McDonagh's cracking facility of unorthodox storytelling becomes the linchpin in luring a plethora of admirers

 Brilliant

 Unusually deep for a crime drama

 Contains an important message underneath all profanity and mayhem

 A great story, with AMAZING performances!

 Engrossing, Albeit Predictable at Times

 A gritty, engaging film with some moral intrigue

 Very honest and brutal

 a vicious cycle of pain and rage...

 Dark but not too dark . . .

 Three cheers for this one.

 This is cinema at it's peak

 Expected and unexpected, but worth seeing :)

 It exceeded my expectations.

 Beautiful film
