 Benigni attempts to pull the wool over our eyes. This is a dishonest, despicable film.

 People should update their ratings!

 hopelessly naive

 Roberto Benigni should be locked away

 Just short of truly awful

 The most overrated film of the decade.

 Have you all lost your bloody minds?!

 Imaginative Nonsense

 First half 'OK' second half 'RIDICULOUS'

 Not my cup of tea

 not necessary

 How can this be treated in this way?

 A different take...

 Just another love story

 very silly and stupid movie about... the holocaust??

 Not the best film on this subject.
