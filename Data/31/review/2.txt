***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I really don't understand how anyone with a critical sense can like such a film. I mean, I'm not a cynical person, but I truly can't stand 100%-righteous characters such as Coffey, Hedgecomb and all the other nice death row wardens. I'm not a 5-year-old kid and I can't watch The Green Mile without being sarcastic. How can any spectator accept the way this tall black guy is playing? And what did Frank Darabont expect spectators to react watching his so unfair and unhappy fate? Did he want us to burst into tears? Come on! The Shawshank Redemption was shot a few years ago by the same director. It was a prison movie like this one but it was a good one for it avoided too many melodramatic effects and because the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were above all human characters. Those played by Tom Hanks and every other cast member aren't humans. They are nothing but all-American icons and I hate that. Besides the death penalty issue is the heart of the film. Does Darabont seriously tackle it? Never! In The Green Mile, being legally executed appears to be something which has to be taken for granted by every citizen, no matter if people die in some awful way (i.e. Eugène Delacroix, the guy with the lovely mouse), and no matter if an innocent guy sometimes gets toasted. At the end of the film, old Hedgecomb confesses that he couldn't stand executions anymore after Coffey died. So what did he decide to do? Did he organize public protests and demonstrations against this punishment? No! He just left the penitentiary and found another job. What a hero! What an activist! Sorry, everyone, but all this really sucks.
** Mild spoilers **This movie is the most overrated movie I have ever seen. The plot is good, most of the acting is acceptable, but it goes wacko when the character John has the ability to heal other people and enormous amounts of flies flows out of his mouth after he has healed people.What's next? That an alien will jump out of the wardens head and tell people about Jesus?My problem is that I'm not superstitious or religious, so I have a problem with evil flies living inside people, or that healing takes place. If there are flies of evil living inside of you, or you keep that as an option, this might be a good movie for you. Keep the flies coming.The real problem lies in that the movie mixes the genre of realistic drama/action, together with a few strains of fantasy. The genre mixing is completely out of place, and very typical USAian.
Never have I been this angry with a movie. Never, and except for 'The 51st State' this is by far the worst I've ever seen. Of course, you can't question or criticize the standard of this production - it's definitely an a-movie if you were to look at the amount of money put into it, but that's really not the point. It wouldn't be the first time a studio put a couple of millions too many into an easily sold, and too easily chewed, heart breaking story.And yeah, the story is so hilarious, I'm not going to comment on it much further, but it contains "the narrator", "the hero", "the one that brings the story forward", "the good", "the bad", "the funny" and "the unbeliever that becomes a believer". Nothing new beneath the sun, only poorly executed re-runs of ideals belonging in the 19th century. When it finally reaches the not very surprising end, we are supposed to be crying our guts out. If we are, we have been had by the studio, falling for all the oldest tricks in the book.'The Green Mile' is in short one of those films that are glowing in their very contempt and low thoughts of the viewer. Every clishé, and no artistic thought, has been put into it. It really is as if Darabont is mocking us with it. Doesn't he think more of us than an ignorant, easily entertained, and easily moved, mob? Is he kidding?The only thing I can say that is at least a bit positive about 'The Green Mile' is Graham Greene. Had it not been for him, my 2 would have been a 1.
I don't understand why this movie is so highly rated.  I suspect it's partly a christian-thing given the theme and all.  Not being raised christian it doesn't connect with me.  But regardless, the movie has several problems:First, every scene is twice as long as it needs to be.  Also include many formulaic scenes when I the moviegoer was supposed to go "ooh ahh" in wonderment, but instead I was so bored.  This film could have been 1.5 hours long with no loss of content.  Tom Hank's closing line is even something like "the green mile can seem awfully long."  Oh the irony.Second, the writers give the characters a handicap of being incapable of communicating -- JC rambles about "helping people" when he could simply say "hey look I have special powers allow me to demonstrate."  If I were in charge of sentencing, I could see myself putting him on death row too -- it is so frustrating.  The same frustration comes from the buildup to the scene with the warden's wife -- if Tom Hanks only lucidly told the warden what's up, they could've done the job in 5 minutes without any fuss.  Instead, they were cryptic and turned it into a 45 minute production.  What a waste of time.Third, the philosophy of the movie just doesn't seem right.  The prison guards all have super-cushy jobs.  Compare to the characters in Saving Private Ryan.  Which extreme commands more respect?  I don't see building heroes out of prison guards.  Similarly, the main character JC is wallows in self-pity.  Rather than be so depressed about the evil in the world, he needs to swallow it and go out and do something with his life.  Take valium if you have to.  If you're in trouble with the US government, flee to Yemen.These problems were on my mind every minute of the film.  Most likely you won't be bothered by them, given the ratings.  But to be safe, in case you watch The Green Mile and after 1/2 an hour you don't like it, turn it off you won't like the next 2 1/2 hours either.


                
First of all, this movie fails like most Stephen King conversions to the big screen. Stephen King is a horrible writer, one of the worst of the 20th Century. His base characterizations are like poorly sketched comic book characters. The only thing that saves this movie are the actors supporting Tom Hanks (Sam Rockwell and Harry Dean Stanton to name two). Tom Hanks has a great money making face but his acting is pretty bland and sub-standard in most movies. The writing, however, is just stupid as most King ventures. Grown men get scared and pee their pants and the ironies that he is able to present are so obvious they are like being hit in the face with a building (very BIG black man is a sweet and harmless innocent). This movie was like going to an fine Italian restaurant and ordering a nice Farfalle with Creme Sauce and getting cockroaches in white paint. Yuk. 2 out of 10.


                
This movie was offensive to me. I felt (and I am sure people will be happy to disagree with me) that the black character in this film was trivialized and ultimately only served to further the white characters lives.Just to illustrate, the character is not intelligent. He is overtly meant to symbolize Jesus Christ, but he is not smart. The white characters, with very few exceptions are not racist (in the South, in the 1930's!? and before you say anything, I live in CO now, but grew up in Mississippi). So you have this group of death row guards, who care about the prisoners, except one mean guard. You have this eight-foot-tall black man who is dumb and scared. However he can raise the dead. I realize this is supposed to be magical realism, but switch this to Germany in the 40's, make the black guy jewish, and the guards nazis, and nobody would buy it. Death row guards in the South were as racist then as they are today. Working on Death Row does not make you sympathetic to prisoners, it makes you cold and angry.
***SPOILERS****(although if you haven't seen this, don't. Go rent Dead Man Walking)Forget the obvious historically inaccurate premise. Let's just look at the fact that this is an uplifting movie when the most sympathetic person is killed, and Tom Hanks lives to be 300. It is obvious that this is yet another movie where black people are meant to be only helpers to the white main characters (Legend of Bagger Vance, Ghost, Song of the South). Even though this character is physically, morally, and supernaturally superior to everyone else, he uses his powers only to help the white guards, not to escape, or survive, but to die that Tom Hanks might live. If that is it, then this movie is a tragedy.This movie is pure crap. I gave it a 2 for the cinematography. Tom Hanks plays a fatter version of his normal part, likeable white guy (when will this guy play a villain?). Stephen King provides the story (thanks for writing about the South, Stephen. You're from Maine right?). Together they manage to trivialize everything from the Civil Rights struggle to the Bible. Nice work, guys. Hope you enjoy the money.
When you become one of the most famous novelist alive in America today, somehow the people around you should be bold enough to tell you;One: you wrote the best prison story of all time, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, so why go back to the same arena to write of prisons again?Two : the movie is not beliveable because of what happens in the first few minutes of the film, and where the film is set.  In the South in the 1930's, a black man is seen holding two dead young white girls.  He is found by a group of gun totting redneck yahoos.  Duh boom boom boom boom boom end of movie.Black men were lynched in the South up to the 1950's and maybe even the 60's for just looking at a white woman.Someone should have told Stephen to write about lobstering or write a cookbook.


                
For anyone interested in seeing The Green Mile, I have a recommendation: stay home and watch The Shawshank Redemption for the umpteenth time.Frank Darabont had simply amazed me with The Shawshank Redemption, and so I had high expectations from this film, which came from the same author, same director, same screenwriter, and an impressive cast. In fact, it left me nowhere near tears, except possibly those shed for spending three hours wading through excessive (and missed) sentiment.Let me stress something. If you happened to like The Green Mile, I can understand...to an extent. In fact, if this film had been an hour and a half long, I would have left throwing Academy Awards at it. If such a film had been accomplished within a humane amount of film, I'd have been impressed. But accomplishing this little dramatically when dealing with such a difficult issue as the death penalty over such an immense amount of time is simply inexcusable.There are some individual performances that stand out, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan and David Morse's. However, they are overshadowed by Tom Hanks playing Forrest Gump a second time (although a little brighter this time) and two altogether too evil to be believable villains (played by Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell).I think this film had great potential after seeing it. Nonetheless, in its overzealous chase for Academy Awards, it ruined its own legitimacy and pounded the viewer with more and more attempts to suspend disbelief.I, for one, am like a certain character in the movie. I'm more than willing to walk "the green mile" to end all the pain.2 1/2 (out of 10)


                
Doesn't anyone else remember the episode of Amazing Stories called "Healer" which starred Patrick Swayze?  Stephen King must certainly have had this story of a death-row prisoner who can heal with his touch.  It was a great half-hour, and there was a memorable shot of Swayze touching the hands of other inmates on his march to death row in order to "heal" them.  That was a half-hour in 1986.  Why does Stephen King take 6 novellas and Frank Darabont over three hours to tell the same story with less impact.  Suckers who bought into the shameless "Shawshank Redemption" will no doubt place this film high on the top 250.  Well kids, one thing it sure is not--original.


                
Those who have seen 'The Shawshank Redemption' and liked it should remember director Darabont by that one. Because everything that worked for that movie, 'The Green Mile' is lacking. In this overlong and oversentimental story Darabont starts to think the world is devided in good guys and bad guys and once he has begun making his point, you don't want to listen anymore. This one didn't deserve all the nominations it got and you simply can't believe Darabont waited so long with his next movie and came up with this.


                
Comparisons of The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption will be inevitable: same author, same director, similar settings.  But where Shawshank was an inspiring story of one man's believable struggle to keep hope and follow his dreams, Green Mile resorts to magic and sentimentalism to make a vague, sappy point.Believe it or not, the "point" of this overlong artificiality is, simply put, some folk good and some folk bad.  It tries to be a stirring parable of accepting people for who they are, not what they're supposed to be, but several factors water it down.  The most glaring flaw is that the entire story hinges on a supernatural element.  How are we supposed to draw insight into our own lives from a movie that so heavily relies on fantasy?The characters themselves are two dimensional stereotypes.  You've got your good and fair cop here, your bratty and abusive cop there, both watching over a weepy gentle giant and a mischievous hell-raiser.  But there's never anything revealed about these characters' pasts, nor insight into their motivations.  Throw in a subservient and acquiescent wife, a put-upon yet diplomatic warden, a hard-nosed trial lawyer and a lovable, feisty trusty for nice scenery and you've got the entire scope of this film.  There is very little character development, either.  The only evidence we have of any characters' development is the maudlin lines they say the same way they say them throughout the entire movie.All of these glossy, plastic elements in a film with a subject as controversial and sobering as capital punishment borders on the appalling. The film as a whole feels detached from the real world, and when the explicit violence that occurs is perpetuated upon cartoons, the film itself becomes a cartoon, too.  It rings hollow.

THis film was so boring. I have nothing againt 3-hour movies ... as long as they're interesting. There was nothing the least bit interesting about this film.  Like most people, I absolutely loved "The Shawshank Redemption," and I'm a big fan of Hanks, as well as David Morse ("St. Elsewhere") and even Bonnie Hunt so I had high hopes for "TGM." Unfortunately, it could not have been more boring and frankly, it boggles my mind that no major critic or imdb reviewer) seemed to agree w/me. See for yourself. If you are suffering from insomnia, this would be the perfect movie to rent.


                
After the Shawshank Redemption, I was eagerly looking forward to this collaboration between Frank Darabont and Stephen King. The Shawshank Redemption truly was a beautiful film, but I'm afraid this is a sentimental, corny mess. The characters are so 1-dimensional, the dialogue is woeful and the relationship between the guards and the prisoners is highly unbelievable. I can't believe any audience would allow their emotions to be manipulated in such a blatant, unsubtle manner. Horrible stuff.


                
All you reviewers drooling at the mouth and giving this 7, 8 stars and more. Did we watch the same movie? Tom Hanks' chronic NSU gets miraculously cured by a death row inmate grabbing him by the crotch and as an added bonus Hanks is immediately afterwards able to give his grateful wife multiple orgasms after what appears to be many years of marital bedtime inactivity? After that scene I had no hesitation in switching off this formulaic US post WW2 era prison drama despite the amazing cast. 2 points for the scenes in the first 15 minutes in the Old Folks Home.
I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is one of the most dissapointing Stephen King movies next to the original Shining.  I believe myself to be one of Stephen King's best fans, and Mr. Darabont did not do as well a job on The Green Mile as he did on The Shawshank Redemption.  He cut out the most important scene of the book - the last scene.  The bus scene is one of the most heart-wrenching, just plain sad scenes I have ever read in a book, and if you don't cry after reading it, you have no heart.  It gets the point of the entire story across to you and makes you feel as if there is no hope in the world.  That's not the best feeling to have, but it was the path the book was taking all along.  With the movie, I felt like I sat through it for 3 hours and went home with a Hollywood happy/sad ending.  They didn't even kill Mr. Jingles!!!  Don't watch this movie - read the book instead.  There is no difference between salvation and damnation.


                
A truly useless film, without any meaning. A great disappointment. I do not understand how it could have been so successful
