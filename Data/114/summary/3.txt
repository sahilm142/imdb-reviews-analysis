 Not UP to par with other Pixar classics

 Not a Children's Movie!

 His worst time ever

 It was too sad

 "Up" - It Ain't "Up"-lifting

 The voice of dissent

 Good for nothing waste of time

 Up is not for small children! Parents beware!

 After touching opening,same old Disney schmaltz!

 Brilliant only if you have a high-contrast TV...

 Depressing

 Ridiculously overrated

 Am I the only one that found this depressing and boring.

 Pixar's Downfall is from its own "UP"fall

 When will Pixar make great art?
