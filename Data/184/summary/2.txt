 Terribly inaccurate.

 PFFFT!!! GIVE ME A BREAK!! NICE FANTASY!!

 Dishonest Fluff For The Easily Impressed

 Killed the legend of Queen

 There's a lot of songs of the band Queen in this movie.

 What a travesty

 Is it Queen or Led Zeppelin?

 Music is nice

 Why such rave reviews?

 A documentary would be clearly better

 A brilliant capture of Freddie, although accuracy would have made the movie great

 Performances were good, but movie is pretty bad

 Realistic but boring
