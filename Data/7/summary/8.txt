 The end of the Journey

 Great story; well adapted for enthusiasts but feels long for others.

 Brilliant, and yet not so brilliant...

 Tolkien fans, this is what we feared

 good, but definitely not deserving of #4 of all time

 Yes But

 Great but too long

 Good film. But top 10? Nah.

 Lord of Many Endings

 Beware of the corny ending

 The pieces are moving...

 The most emotional and captivating movie I have ever seen.

 The End of the Trilogy and it's good, except the end!

 Good, but not something I would want to see again

 "This is no place for a Hobbit."

 It finally all comes down to this

 I thought they didn't make 'em like this anymore...I was wrong

 Okay, it's good, but the CG and length are excessive. - 8 of 10

 Not really satisfying.

 A wonderful movie

 The End is near ...

 An epic conclusion to a classic literary work, and now, movie trilogy

 Great Trilogy ends 90% great, 10% weak

 The Dusk of an Epic Trilogy

 Great But Not Perfect
