I have heard so many praise this series and I can really not see why. I have seen 18 episodes of this show and after 18 episodes, really nothing has happened. Really. Nothing has happened, which according to me is a miracle.The story is progressing at turtle speed. In the first 15 episodes or so, 95% of the content is about food, how hungry they are, how they are going to get money for food, whacking up some random guys to get money for food and finally eating food. You got it? Everything is about food.Don't get me started on the music. Mixing feudal Japan with rap, hip hop and scratching is according to me just horrible and I'm not even Japanese. The intro song is so bad you just laugh at it, especially the lyrics.But everything is not horrible. The animation is really good, so are the fighting scenes. You can see they have really put effort into the animation, you don't see any normal cheap tricks like making the fighting and running occur with blurry closeups/swooshing, if you know what I mean. The female character is also alright, nothing of that "I behave like I am 6 years old and am doped up on speed", like most female characters behave in anime.If they put so much effort into the animation, why not putting up a decent manuscript as well? Why they didn't do this is a clue to me. No wonder the show almost got canceled in Japan and that they had to do a break after the 17th episode. Really, the story progress is as dull as watching paint dry. The characters evolve about just as fast as the paint. You got to know something about their backgrounds after a dozen+ of episodes or so. Or why the heck they are even doing what they are doing. Unacceptable.Enough said. Spend your time on something else. After I had seen the 18th episode, which was the start of season 2, I gave up. The episode that was supposed to perhaps give this show new life was perhaps one of the worst in the whole series.
