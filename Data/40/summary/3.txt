 Feeling good? No.

 A predictable "feel good" film from France

 Pretty ghastly...

 French hypocrisy is as good as American

 Cripplexploitation - a new genre?

 The Intouchables: Don't touch it with a ten foot pole

 Crude movie with very few redeeming values

 Hypocritical justification of inaction and complacency for the healthy ones
