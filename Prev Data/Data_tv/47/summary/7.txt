 Narcos Season 1 Review

 A brave attempt at being credible

 Never get to that point where you feel" this is why this is one of the popular show right now"

 Lord of War version of Pablo Escobar

 Nice

 Good TV show, but..

 A French speaking JFK!

 Flawed but entertaining drama.

 Well produced and entertaining but slightly disappointing

 It's good

 Great portrait of the Narcos in Colombia-Drawback the cast

 Horrible Spanish by main character quite annoying to hear accent

 Entertaining and a bit shallow

 Tension filled and fast paced

 Excellent show but it glorifies criminals

 Good but the protagonist was so dull!

 Narcos

 Not the 8.8/10 series I expected

 Very good for a drug lord's story

 It's all good till it's Pablo

 Not accurate with historical facts and Main Characters Accents

 Not so shabby
