 Uh, where are the middle-of-the-road viewers

 My Least favourite Spider-Man movie. Definitely NOT what the critics led me to believe.

 Meh

 Promising start, but went downhill from there

 I hate miles

 What?

 Movie is very slow and has limited action

 Not sure what the point was...

 Worst spider man movie ever
