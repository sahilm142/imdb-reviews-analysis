 Thoughts on The Assassination of Gianni Versace

 Fascinating story with a serious casting mistake

 Season 2 is good but too much conjecturepresented as history

 The Versace series is great

 Season 1 mindblowing - season 2 not so much.

 Looks to be one of the great shows of 2016!

 A curiously serious case presented with eccentric details and a pinch of irony.

 American Crime Story: Compelling and Worth the Time

 LA 94-95

 So Far, So Good

 Comparable To Any Mainstream Theatrical Release!...

 Darren Criss and Penelope Cruz stood out to me the most.

 Strong cast, good screenplay, keeps its eye on the ball

 American Crime Story: Assassination of Gianni Versace - What a Frightening Ride

 Well Produced, Well Directed, Well Acted

 Amazing depth, excellent acting and casting, except OJ.

 Very good

 Very Realistic Casting - "Social Justice" Shown for What it Truly Is

 Brilliant drama and well executed

 So Real...

 Emotional/Powerful Drama, Lacking in Quality Actors/Actresses

 Entertainment first is the motto!! Brilliant execution.
