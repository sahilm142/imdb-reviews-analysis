 wow! what amazing series....

 Slow but Interesting

 What you should expect watching (First paragraph doesn't have spoilers)

 Kudos to John Turturro, Riz Ahmed, Bill Camp, and Michael Kenneth Williams

 Watch it for the journey, not the ending.

 Brave HBO Once Again!...

 I Got out of my mind

 I need one more season

 well-shot and acted and keeps me entertained throughout.

 The only criticism.....

 Really enjoyed it.

 A solid miniseries with good performances and without abundant aridity

 Enjoyable, Hey SOUND guy.....

 A Great Start but not a very convincing End

 compelling telling of a crime procedural

 Weakest flaw is drug use portrayal

 Our Lives in Confinement WARNING: SPOILERS

 At last, something worth watching!

 A drama not a whodunit

 Well acted with a great cast...

 worth seeing
