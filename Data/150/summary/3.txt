 Boring beyond imagination.

 3 hours of jackasses behaving as jackasses

 Poor over the top performance by Dicaprio, boring overlong movie

 I'm a BIG Scorsese fan, but...

 Total disappointment

 Good for adolescent boys, I guess.

 Good acting overshadowed by bad directing and predictable script.

 Debauched, lewd, incoherent, frivolous, Scorcese cannibailzes "Goodfellas".

 Unbearable

 Significantly Disappointed

 Way too long & just not very good.

 Bad Film

 What the hell did I just watch?

 Very Boring--No Satisfaction

 Dog Turd of the Cinema

 decontextualized "fun" like pulling the wings off flies

 Good movie, excessive human degradation

 Poorly presented recycled story about enormous greediness

 Don't cry because it happened, smile because it's over.

 Waste of a movie which in fact had had to much potential to be a perfect one.

 Stupid... Based on real events or not, doesn't matter...

 I was one of the few

 Avoid this piece of trash

 Was the editor on holiday?

 The Wolf of the Excess
