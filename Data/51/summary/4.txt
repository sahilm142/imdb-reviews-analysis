 Sucked

 No substance

 Don't believe the hype

 at best mildly entertaining

 How did this get an 8.5 I seriously don't understand

 A cerebral puzzle without passion

 I've got it, I've got it<U+0085> Heck, I've got it.

 is it really that good?

 Clever thriller

 Wow. This truly bites.

 Very witty!

 What? How is this movie in the Top 20???

 Over-complicated and overrated

 Its necessary restrictions cripple it

 Well-made depiction of unworthy plot

 Definition of overrated

 Mediocrity Gone Mad! Yet another cynical and senseless byproduct of this wonderful era of cinema.

 Master of self-delusion

 Huge, huge, huge, HUGE disappointment

 Clever But Tedious.

 Nice Editing, Poor Film

 Not the most terrible but far from good.

 Wish I had short term memory loss and could forget the movie.

 so-so movie, nothing special, of no real importance 4/10

 i've already forgotten it
