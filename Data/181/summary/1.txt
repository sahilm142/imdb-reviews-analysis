 Dinosaurs come to life, in lifeless film.

 A very bad script ruins it all

 Spielberg at his worst

 Not a good movie at all

 worth seeing for its special effects

 Jurassic Puke

 Would have made a great 45 min Twilight Zone Episode

 Fake dinosaurs - Empty heads = Bad movie.

 Completely horrible

 awful movie
