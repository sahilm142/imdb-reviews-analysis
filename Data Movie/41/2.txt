This is a time-travel adventure comedy film, set in California, starring Michael J. Fox. BTTF has a reputation as 'a film that's impossible to dislike'. We're supposed to ignore (or not notice) the plot holes and inconsistencies. I disliked this film when I watched it during my teens - and even more when I watched it during my twenties. I can't see how any adult can enjoy this childish nonsense.
