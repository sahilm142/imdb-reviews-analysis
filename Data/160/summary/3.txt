 Overrated and disappointing

 Very long, drawn out, and in the end pointless

 There will be boredom

 Disappointing

 Another piece of crap by P.T. Anderson

 2 Hours 40 Minutes of Drudgery

 Sadistic.

 Way overrated

 Altogether an unsatisfying watch

 One-dimensional portrait of American businessman

 Boring, plodding and excruciatingly long.
