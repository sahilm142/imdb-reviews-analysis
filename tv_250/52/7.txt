I kinda like the idea of having an alzheimer patient as a serial killer for a purpose because the Agah character is showing some funny side of an old man behaving as if everything is ok when he is punishing the victims according to his judgment.It reminded me the both Gustavo and Walter White together.Just to be clear,i didn't like the flow of the events and transmissions, they could have been faster and more complicated.Maybe just the scriptwriters are taking it slow for now ,and they will adjust this deadlock and adrenalin balance later in last episodes.However ,i must confess the main reason i've been watching this TV series is definitely Haluk Bilginer, one of the greatest actors of the world. He is amazing on all his acts .And i cannot help myself to stop saying how much lack of act the Nevra character has,why so?It is not enough to create a perception for just the main character,the rest of the cast need more details ,too.What's more,description of the place related to all events happening for should be more detailed instead of being a symbol.Generally i liked this tv series and it gives remarkable hope for Turkish productions,it is worth to watch because it is more than just a serial killer movie,it is more like a psychonarration.
