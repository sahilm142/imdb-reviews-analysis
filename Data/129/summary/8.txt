 From the imagination of Guillermo Del Toro

 24 Hours Later ... Still Not Sure What to Make of It

 Ofelia Dreams

 Innocence: Weapon Against Sadistic Violence

 Pan's Labyrinth

 A stunning reminder of the harshness of childhood...

 A personal film about memory

 Confrontingly fantastic

 I have ALWAYS loved this movie!

 One of a Kind Fantasy film. Definitely Del Toro's greatest film!

 Very fine film

 Powerful

 Never Escapes From The Fact It's Two Entirely Separate Stories

 Good fantasy-realistic movie!

 A fine film but it wasn't the Spanish Civil war

 Extraordinary adult faerie tale

 Compelling adult fairy tale...

 Violent but so moralizing

 A successful fairy tale film, finally.
