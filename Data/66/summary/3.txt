 This was what all the fuss was about?

 Repugnant and meaningless

 Didn't do anything for me.

 Doesn't Deserve To Be In The IMDb Top 250 List

 proving that style and sizzle does not a movie make

 A complicated plot for a useless ending

 Never such abysmal content has been presented with such brilliant style

 Ad Nauseam

 Manga comics do not a good film make

 Overrated indeed.

 Didn't live up to my expectations

 Don't bother. Rubbish.

 Just awful. Who thinks up a story like this?

 Interesting concept,but major flaws

 A disgusting nihilistic incest pedo fantasy

 Visual Masterpiece, Emotionally Incomplete

 Beautifully made fatuity

 Man did that suck!!!!

 Sick Plot overrated movie
