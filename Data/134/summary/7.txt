 Lacking in plot but charming nonetheless

 Very imaginative, while slightly empty

 Cute little magical story

 Sweet

 My Neighbour Totoro

 Didn't reach to my expectations.

 "We had such a weird, mysterious, spectacular day!"

 Cute anime. Childhood/sisterhood/nature spirits

 looks great, but...

 disappointed

 Family-oriented Miyazaki tale and perhaps his most heartwarming story

 Great movie just make sure...

 A charming film; however not one of Studio Ghibli's strongest productions

 Gentle fare for the youngest children

 Rather disappointing.

 Sweet, enchanting, heart-warming movie

 Untapped Imagination

 Just Hayao Miyazaki...

 Cute

 A treat for all to cherish

 A nice film for a quiet evening

 MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO (Hayao Miyazaki, 1988) ***

 Spellbound by Totoro?

 Good for small kids and parents alike
