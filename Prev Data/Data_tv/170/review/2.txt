Now I understand the appeal of 'The Office'. It was revolutionary at the time and well deserves its title of being a modern classic. But sometimes with comedy you have to put your hands up and say "it's not for me". And on this occasion I have to do that with this show.It's well written, it's well acted but I don't find it all that funny or to be honest the characters all that endearing other than in the Christmas specials that ended the show. Gervais was catapulted into the big time based on playing David Brent and fair play to him.I can't say though that I love the language that's often used or the sexual references. Some of the episodes plod along and the second series in particular is at times depressing. All these reasons are why I rank this show so low.
