 Sometimes Overdone, But Entertaining & Worthwhile

 Spectacular but way too long

 Buy the Collector's Series DVD and watch both versions!

 great film. don't be scared away by the religious parts.

 Apart From its Climax, This is a Great Piece of Film-making and Drama

 This film is literally epic

 the apotheosis of mainstream studio production in Hollywood's Golden Era

 An iconic film from the golden age of Hollywood

 The best of it is unsurpassed epic movie-making, but it's a message heavy movie

 OVERRATED BUT STILL CLASSIC ONE...

 Epic of epics

 Must be judged in the context of its time and subject

 A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Ben-Hur (1959)

 Ben-Hur A Memorable Epic Film

 " We keep you alive to serve this ship. so row well and live "

 Bigger, longer, time for a cut

 Good But A Little Too Long To Watch Often

 Spectacular!!!!

 A wonderful old fashioned thriller

 A remarkably strong film

 A beautiful tale of forgiveness

 Your eyes are full of hate, forty-one. That's good. Hate keeps a man alive. It gives him strength.

 When shooting an epic was an epic in itself

 It's great!
