 The most famous anime of all times

 "2001-a space odyssey" has just been beaten

 Breathtaking beyond belief

 Evangelion is one of anime's most influential and important title and frankly one of their best

 A Masterpiece

 Shows that anime is not a form of Satuday morning cartoons!

 What makes a masterpiece?

 Possibly the Best Anime

 powerful, visceral, thought-provoking masterpiece

 Beyond anything you'll ever experience

 "What Are You, Stupid?"....."Anta Baka?!"

 The Greek Tragedy that never was

 The single greatest piece of mass media I have ever viewed

 Robots and Aliens and Government Agents, OH MY!

 Your new God.

 An absolute masterpiece that is essential viewing for fans of quality film and television:

 Classic, Controversial, Epic and flawed due to the final two episodes

 This is a "must see" for kids.

 Masterpiece

 One of the Best Anime Series Ever, don't get confused by the name it is not about religion.

 Life Changing Anime

 Seat thyself within the damned golem, Shinji

 One of the deepest story ever who has been shown.

 A Science fiction masterpiece.
