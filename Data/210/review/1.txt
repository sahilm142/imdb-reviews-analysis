This is purportedly a movie about love and loyalty between a man an his dog, but in it they manage to show you everything you absolutely shouldn't do as a responsible pet owner. I wanted to like this movie but I was too busy cringing at the danger the dog Hachi was constantly placed in due to the neglect of his absentee owners. If you really love your pet you should watch this movie and do the exact opposite of everyone in it.Here are some thoughts I had while watching it (*spoilers ahead*):Magic puppy that just sits there being cute and doesn't pee / poop / tear up everything. In reality, raising a puppy is a lot of hard work, and it doesn't get a lot easier once they grow up. This movie will probably encourage more people who shouldn't be pet owners in the first place to go get a pure bred puppy as they make it look way too easy, meanwhile tens of thousands of dogs die unwanted and unloved in shelters. This dog runs all over town but has no collar - what, no leash laws, no mandatory rabies tag? The town I live in would never tolerate this, and for good reason as it is a very real danger to both the dog and the townsfolk. Dog runs all over streets and around active train tracks and "loving" owner is unalarmed. If that was my dog I'd be having a cow. Complete absence of cars, even parked ones, till near the end when son-in-law comes to pick up dog. I think this was to keep you from thinking about the dog getting hit by a car while it's roaming the streets unleashed and unattended. I couldn't stop thinking about it though. The dog is anthropomorphized to an unbelievable degree. Look, dogs don't understand complex English sentences, but that doesn't stop every character in this movie from behaving like they can. The two most grating scenes in the movie revolve around this: 1) The first time Hachi follows Gere to the train station, Gere tells the dog to go home and somehow expects the dog to know what he's saying - Gere doesn't seem to care if the dog goes home or not, as long as it leaves the train station long enough for him to get to his job on time, and 2) the sentimental speech delivered by the "loving" daughter to the dog right before she opens the gate and allows the dog to run away and roam the streets homeless. The zoned-out wife didn't even realize the dog escaped from the backyard, even though she just got a soft spot for it and fed it treats. Wife quits job and leaves town right after husband dies - with a daughter & grandchild living in town? What, hubby didn't have any life insurance to go with that cushy job at the university? I kind of don't believe it. Perhaps some critical setup / background scenes were cut as it makes no sense? Then again, nothing in this movie makes much sense. Magic Asian meets wife at the graveyard, completely out of the blue, like he's been standing there for ten years, flowers in hand, waiting for her to appear. Entire town seems to be aware of dog story, but entire family that owned dog is completely clueless? Relentlessly syrupy movie music telegraphing every emotion we're supposed to feel - it made me hate the sound of strings & piano (and I really like strings and piano). True story taken so far out of context and time, and given the complete Hollywood treatment to the point where it makes zero sense. Dull, uninspired plot, script, characters, acting - except for depraved indifference to Hachi, nothing really happens. Jason Alexander can't do anything but be George Costanza, why was he in this movie (or any movie for that matter)? Puppy leash removal on train tracks at end, so the whole absentee owner thing starts over again - wasn't once enough?I never thought I would say this, but even Free Willy is a better animal-centric movie than this one.
I sat down to watch what I thought would be a 10 out of 10 film after looking at other reviews, but I must say it's one of the most bori g slow moving films I have ever watched.
Sure it's probably loosely based on some true story but that's not enough. 
I was close to turning the film off until he died thinking at last we have something happening (other than a man playing with a dog), but no, it was just the dog sitting outside the station. 
Big disappointment and family agree so I'm not on my own.
I tend to only consider reviewing movies which I either think are great, or, despise. This would be one of the latter. A fluffy tale about a fluffy dog. Carter (Gere) is the perfect American father and husband. He's handsome, carries a briefcase. He wears an overcoat, yet, is artistic, sensitive, educated. He loves his wife. He finds a lost puppy in a trainstation and, reluctantly, brings it home to his perfect American wife, beautiful, artistic; playful, yet stern; in their perfect Conneticut house. Before long, the puppy endears itself to man and woman (as well as perfect daughter) and they decide to keep it. Joy precedes tragedy, etc. The lead character, hachi, is a dog. He is not great, not bad. He had no trouble sitting there, looking cute. But, when it came to expressing himself, he lacked. "What is it boy?" I never could quite figure that out. All in all, a film about a sad dog who refuses to let us in beyond his stoic and stubborn gesture of grieving. A montage of familiar actors ooohing and aaahing. A cookie cutter vision of life. It didn't make me weep. Perhaps I am a hard hearted cynic. Perhaps I want to learn something from a movie.... I didn't learn anything here.
How could there be spoiler warning in any review concerning this movie when all that happened is that Gere and the dog met and than Gere died and the dog waited and waited and waited... He pretty much waited the hell out of the movie! Some say that his waiting for Gere to come back taught us a valuable lesson about love. I say it taught us how to waste a perfectly good life, it taught us not to move on, to dwell in memories and stay sad and depressed for the rest of your life! That was not love! It was death and withering! Also, I don't know if it was just a bad script or the influence of Hachi, but every time someone got close to him, they got really really frantic, started to call his name again and again and again, saying random phrases like, lets go, good dog, come on! etc... The family that adopted the dog was perfect, so there was no room for a plot developing there and... I don't know what else to write. There was more nothing in this movie than all the other movies I've seen put together!
**This review contains spoilers** Aside from being really boring (not enough to work with for a feature film), there are so many unrealistic parts to this movie, I am not going to go into them all. The true story does not translate well to American culture or modern times. What normal family would let their beloved pet live on the streets for 10 years, even through harsh winters? I don't care how compelled the dog was to wait at the train station, no responsible pet owner would do that.And then the wife visits the town she left nearly ten years after her husbands death and acts like she is so surprised to see the dog living at the train station, like she didn't know that. It was her own daughter who let the dog out to return to the station.The wife didn't seem that distraught at her husbands funeral: the love of her life who died suddenly and prematurely. She acted like she was at some distant cousin's funeral. OMG, I could go on and on.I did cry, rather harshly, at the end; but still thought the movie was the worst I can recall ever seeing.


                
Putting aside the trite story-telling, and the cheap camera tricks, this movie has two glaring problems.For one - it's another example of the white-washing of Hollywood. This is a Japanese tale. Why did it have to transported to America? Why couldn't it be told in Japan, with Asian actors? Why rob more minority actors of roles that should by rights be theirs? Think how much richer and more interesting the movie would have been if it had portrayed an accurate portrayal of Japanese culture for American audiences! But my larger issue is from the animal welfare point of view. Of course Hachi shows great loyalty to his owner - but where is the family's loyalty to him? They abandon him to the streets for 10 years, to survive on scraps and hot dogs, and sleep under rail cars. And then they hug him, and cry, and talk about his amazing loyalty? Then, after Hachi freezes to death, they give the little boy his own akita. Sure, that makes it all better.Thanks, Hollywood, but I expect and demand better.
(I checked off that there are ***spoilers*** in this, but if you have watched the trailer, you saw more spoilers than anything you will see in any of these reviews. That said, if you want to know nothing about the film, don't read this, just understand that if you *truly* love animals and know how to take care of them, you will be disturbed by this film.)We watched this based on the 8.1 rating, and the numerous 10 and 9 star ratings I saw on the mobile app. Little did I know that the mobile app puts all the best ratings first without giving you a way of re-organizing them into love/hate like the regular site does.The idea that so many people liked this film is ... beyond words. Why? Because it means *that* many people think it's acceptable to neglect and abandon a dog without even an *attempt* to assist the dog in it's grief over it's lost guardian. There are so many disturbing abuses in this film it's hard to recount them all but the ones that come to mind are: -- Making a family dog sleep outside in a shed or doghouse as if that's care-taking -- Letting a dog run the streets alone. -- Letting a dog run around without a collar, no matter how small the town -- The abandonment of a loyal and heartfelt friend of the spouse who crossed by the remaining spouse -- The willing allowance of a dog to become homeless (as one person stated here, would you let a 10 year old do anything s/he wanted to do just because s/he wanted to do it?) -- Lack of any obvious nutritional or medical care -- The callous disregard of the dog's grief without an ounce of compassion for the dog or trying to help the dog understand that his human friend isn't coming home. Not only do they do all these things, but the film tries to make it look magnanimous on the part of the characters. Anyone who believes it is acceptable to treat any animal this way shouldn't have an animal under their care. Anyone who thinks this film is 'heartwarming' clearly doesn't have a concept of animals as family members. If they think they do, they are delusional. I work with animals every day and everyday I have to deal with animals who are in grief and emotionally lost because their people treated them like *property*. If you wouldn't do it to your child, don't do it to your dog, or your cat, or any other animal you consider your 'pet.' I just am so angry that a film like this would even be made. I don't know how animals in 1923 Japan were routinely treated, and perhaps this film could have worked setting it in that place and time, and showing other animals being routinely treated badly so that this treatment might look kind in contrast. BUT the film was set in modern day U.S. and as far as I'm concerned, it is *NEVER* okay in *ANY* time or place to treat a dog like they did in this film. I'm just sorry I looked this film up on the IMDb mobile app first. If I had seen some of the more negative reviews with regard to the treatment of Hachi, I would have never watched this film. If you *truly* love dogs, and are a capable pet parent, this film is not for you. It is upsetting and disturbing.
I'll tell you right now what happened in this film. Spoilers or not, you should not care either way as not much happens in this film.Richard Gere finds and befriends a puppy. Puppy gets dependent on Richard Gere because all of his underdeveloped movie family are a bunch of indifferent, neglecting and sometimes even hating a-holes. Puppy turns into a mature hound, every day giving his farewell to and welcoming his owner back the only way he knows how: mainly following Gere to the train station and then waiting for him to return in the evening. Richard Gere gets a heart attack and dies. The dog does not and I emphasize - does NOT get invited to his master's funeral. Dog naturally assumes that Gere will come back one day, since he had seen nothing to prove otherwise. Dog keeps waiting for Richard at the train station. Dog dies of old age. The end.The moral of this story: always invite everyone close to the deceased to the funeral, that includes pet animals. One more thing: this movie is apparently based on the real events that happened in Japan almost a hundred years ago, which goes to show that reality can be a lot dumber than fiction.
At first I wanted to give it a chance. After 1 minute I knew I was in for a shocker. Firstly the acting was a shambles. Secondly, the acting was a shambles.Thirdly, when is Richard Gere going to give up and move into a home. The moving was as slow as an asthmatic ant with a hip replacement moving a mountain. Why the dog doesn't die in the first ten minutes to solve all the problems I don't know. If I was blind and deaf I still wouldn't give it 10 stars. Frankly, Richard should be ashamed of himself.He has let his country down. My sum of all fears is this movie becoming a success, unfortunately it appears that it may be, so my final question is, who do we blame, the director, Richard or the dog. This is the peoples decision. I can't make this. But you can, please everyone think what you have watched. is poison to the mind and an insult to humanity. One day Hollywood will make a good dog movie, maybe about a war dog, because this is unacceptable. Yours sincerely the most sensible movie critic on earth (apparently).


                
This movie is PATHETIC!!!! It is so predictable, and the acting is atrocious. You will be cringing at the fact that you paid anything to watch this TERRIBLY BORING flick. Don't waste your time or money. In fact, I'm actually returning my copy of the movie and demanding a refund. Richard Gere was overpaid for this job, even if he made minimum wage. He should have been ashamed to receive anything. Yes, it is that terrible. I watched the movie to the end just to see if it was terrible all the way through. Guess what? It was!!! You'd be better off watching Mars Needs Moms. Hachi needed acting--it had none. And due to the fact that my review needs ten lines to be posted, I have to bore you with another line. Here's one: Hachi was repetively boring.


                
I use Hachi: A Dog's Tale as a litmus test for screening out psychopaths in my social circle. After all, what kind of heartless cynic pans a dog movie? And some people have the gall to dump all over this. For shame...Hachi is not without its disappointments, however: I kept holding my breath for the "there's nothing' in the rules that says a dog can't play baseball" moment that never transpired. I also found myself questioning Hachi's loyalty for a few brief moments. A famine or, perhaps, a devastating pyroclastic flow enveloping all in its path could have convinced me of his loyalty, but the director removed these scenes from the final cut for some reason.The dog wasn't credited at the end of the film. Which can only mean that Hachi was likely portrayed by ten different dogs that each knew one or two tricks. That really took me out of it.


                
Watched the movie with my wife and my two kids. I did not have to ask how the movie was, they all said out loud that the movie was the worst, ever. I have to agree 100%. It has become a joke now - do you want to watch Hachiko? The answer is obviously: "No, never ever again!". The movie manages to make you sad, but even more bored. The rating of the movie just makes no sense. I guess IMDb would never put it on top 250 no matter how high rating it gets. The story and plot is given almost before the movie starts. The actors are good, but they make no good acting in this movie, where they are just as anemic as the plot. Life is just too short to waste on this movie. If you are curious just read the cover and it is all there - I guess.
The story of a dog with a heart of gold could not allay what we were all pondering in the theater that day: the fear of sepsis. Sepsis is a b---- goddess that can strike at any moment and take our precious limbs away; a fate that befalls Gere's character. This movie spoke to me because I like my elbows, and like Richard Gere, I too have once owned a Golden Retriever. This movie makes social commentary about civilization and the human condition: Hallström takes a few liberties and sets the story in 1990's America instead of 1920's Japan with the intent of showing how similar and, if anything superior, 1990's America was. I remember WWII, and the Japanese didn't fly all the way to Hawaii to sell us defective airbags. Now my daughter liked this movie, but my only complaint is that for all of Hachi's supposed loyalty and intelligence not once does he solve any mysteries or help bring a ragtag team of misfits to the World Series. I'll never look at popcorn again without sobbing uncontrollably.
I watced it and I was bored. It doesn't deserve 8,1 IMDB. It is long. Very long. I started sleeping in 45. Minutes.If you wanna sleep, It is best choice for you.
