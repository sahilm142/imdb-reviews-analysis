 dear fans of "the big lebowski": what the hell, over?

 The overrated lebowski

 The cast is much better than the movie; which, of course, means nothing

 nothing special

 A movie made for a specific demographic

 Crap

 Absolute rubbish, very overrated

 Ha?

 Can't abide the Dude,

 Slobbery

 Tangled Lebowski
