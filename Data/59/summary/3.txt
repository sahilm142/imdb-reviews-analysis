 This movie isn't entertaining (exept maybe for the Thanos fans)

 I didnt get what I have expected

 To long - to many characters - lacks focus - boring

 Before you spend your hard-earned cash...

 4DX Seat To Infinity!

 Do not believe the ratings, this movie is not nearly as good as people claim it is

 Sub par

 Thoroughly Disappointed

 Fanbois ruined this movie

 Not impressed

 biggest disappointment from MCU and pointless

 OMG, but not in a good way

 Meh

 Terribly disappointing

 A Michael Bay infantile movie...

 Not worth watching

 Meh

 Very disappointed

 Very disappointing

 MCU, you're walking on thin ice, be very careful on the very last ending you're planning. Marvel movies are about good, kindness, hope all which leads to happy endings.

 Sensational garbage

 Disappointing.

 I fell asleep

 2-1/2 hrs of mindless chaos

 Disappointing (should have stayed home for the video to catch up and fast forward )
