 An extremely good movie that superseded my preconceptions about the animation style it is presented in.

 Riveting and marvelous cartoon movie by the genius Hayao Miyazaki

 excellent animation

 Possibly Miyazaki's best film

 "The Forest Spirit gives life and takes life away".

 Another good film of Miyazaki's works

 A respond review.

 Humanity and Nature !!!!

 One of Miyazaki's best!

 Excellent, but not for everyone

 Princess Mononoke is a stunning animation and a modern masterpiece.

 Mystical, imaginative and fierce: A mature Miyazaki
