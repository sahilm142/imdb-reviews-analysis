 DJANGO UNCHAINED (Quentin Tarantino, 2012) ***

 Good for Tarantino Fans

 The truth is that it drags and the violence gets generic.

 Django Unchained Rating and Reiview

 More of the Same

 A riot! Samuel Jackson's BEST role!

 Gunslinger goodieness turning stale and pale

 How Tarantino Would Tell a Love Story

 Great fun to watch but on reflection leaves a bit of a bad taste

 Fun pulpy western that will not last.

 Uhhhhhhhhhh

 Quentin Tarantino's messy and bloated take on the mythic "Django" spaghetti westerns and "Mandingo" era blaxploitation films; a bit of a disappointment.

 Tarantino being Tarantino

 Messy and empty

 Very Tarantino...And Yet This Time That Was Part Of The Problem

 Funny, Yet Uber Violent and Crude

 Good but not Great

 Funny.

 An enjoyable ride, albeit one that travels an uneven road and takes too long to get where it's going

 A masterclass in pulp cinema.

 Entertaining and forgettable

 B-Movie Style Western

 Some nice moments but nothing compared to the real Django.

 Most of the movie is great

 A bit much, but still good!
