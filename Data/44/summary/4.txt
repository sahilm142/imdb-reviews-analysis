 Only neat music and cinematography make this tawdry, melodramatic tale of sadomasochistic relationship between jazz conservatory student and teacher, worth watching

 Stupid and Improbable story.

 Hyped up melodrama / Offensive to the meaning of art.

 Story doesn't convince

 Very Disappointed

 Back to Film School

 Flawed and Flashy SPOILERS

 Get Back

 Overblown Melodrama: Offensive to Art and the Artistic Process

 Artificial Drama

 Very Good Acting and Energy, but ridiculously misplaced

 Fantastic drumming and brass but God awful plot

 An incoherent, psychotic rehash of Drumline.

 Why is this film supposed to be great?

 Delusional director is the real "star" of this film

 faux-realistic claptrap about student abuse

 So...the moral of the story is... be mean & harsh to people if you want them to do better!!?????

 baffled as to how it got the rating

 Not quite my tempo
