 A Prairie Home Companion

 F*ck Sean Penn

 First time seeing Sean Penn direct...

 Lots of heart

 Portrayal Does Not Equal Endorsement

 "Is anybody here?"

 I must say it is not a survival movie but a suicidal movie.

 understand but not agree

 In search of time not found.

 Good story

 Very thoughtful

 Sean Penn directs a great man vs nature film that will linger with you

 A haunting film on nature and solitude

 Held my interest despite hypocrisy

 A fascinating true story

 Beware of the Bus!

 A well made but tragic tale.

 Insightful and gorgeously filmed

 A rubber road movie of self discovery

 Great Achievement

 The Little Punce

 A very pretty but unconvincing depiction of the life of Christopher McCandless

 A Sad and Beautiful Tale - But It's A Bit Boring...

 Grizzly Man was better

 Happiness only real when shared
