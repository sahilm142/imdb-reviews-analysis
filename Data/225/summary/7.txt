 "Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone."

 A hymn to life

 Dead Students Classroom...

 A Story of Inspiration

 Good but Not Great

 What Makes a Good Film?

 Sporadically inspiring but flawed and lacks true depth

 A Solid Coming-of-Age Film, But Has Aged Quite a Bit

 One of my favorite endings...

 Old people suck....unfortunately I am one of them

 A question of justice misdirected

 "Carpe Diem, Seize The Day. Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May."

 Good story, not great plot

 Nice movie on defying conformity

 Review of Dead Poets Society

 Rhyme and Reason

 This much can be said for "Dead Poets Society", it will definitely change the lives of any high school or college students watching it

 I don't think people really understand the film

 Bright stars

 a trite scenario salvaged by its director

 Better than most school films
