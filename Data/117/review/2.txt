My Rating : 2/10If you want a good Kurosawa film watch 'Seven Samurai' or 'Rashômon' or 'High and Low'.Yôjinbô alongwith Ran are two of the least favourite of Akira Kurosawa movies for me. Some may undoubtedly like them.This is an easy pass for viewers like me and according to me this movie should be out of the imdb Top 250 as it's pretty terrible in all the ways, bad script, dialogue and most of all the directing and pacing.Don't waste your time here. 2/10.
