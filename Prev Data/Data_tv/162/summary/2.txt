 A real disappointment...

 Cue the fake reviews to save this mess of a show

 Poor TV

 Juvenile drivel

 Too slow to get past the first hour

 Completely boring

 Wasted Potential

 ...Neither here nor there

 Not a bad intro, but seriously? Hasn't this idea been done to death?

 It's dull and boring

 slow paced
