 This time, the Man With No Name has a defined profession<U+0085>

 Bigger and Better

 The return of the man with no name.

 Cowboy Gothic

 Another gritty Leone western is a buddy flick for Eastwood and Van Cleef...

 Good job

 Spaghetti Incident

 Another Great Western Movie of Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef

 Cartoon-like epic western with something for everyone

 "When the chimes end, pick up your gun"

 Not as tense nor as clever as Fistful

 Shootist slays several sixgun slinging slugs

 A solid sequel in a trilogy that I would suggest watching

 Two Rival Bounty Hunters

 All the swagger of Fistful, but improved script, and the man in black is awesome!

 "I didn't hear what the bet was" Monco: "your life".

 Cool, Stylish Spaghetti Western

 Good, but not great.

 Meets national minimum wage.

 As Eastwood says in the finale, 'Bravo.'

 Second of the series

 A pretty good western

 Sergio Leone in another good Western.

 Clint and the rifle-sized magnum
