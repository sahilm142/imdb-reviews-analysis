 Fantasy not History

 You can take the Mickey, but you cannae take it seriously

 Energetic and well produced, but why praise it so much?

 Overrated

 Mel Gibson not very convincing as Wallace

 More unhistorical than many

 Leave Historical movies on Scotland to the Scots.

 Overblown and overrated

 history of the British Isles raped, 20th century cheers

 A number one movie (that is: 1 out of 10)

 Overrated

 Not to be taken Seriously!

 Not worth the hype!!

 Totally for the gore loving simpleton

 Hollywood at its worst

 "Apollo 13" Lost The Best Picture Oscar To This?

 Edward Shawshanks

 Bloody Scots

 This won Best Picture?

 For the guys

 I want my 3 hours back
