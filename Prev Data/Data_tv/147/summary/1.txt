 Boring rich people and their First World problems

 Promising but shallow as a grave in reality

 If no one else is going to say it, I will...

 Possible the worst show ever

 Annoying, i an incredibly boring way.

 Crappy soap

 Only Good Things...

 Basically a soap opera. Mommy wars. Way overrated, very boring, too many cliches

 Bore Feast with horrible Characters

 Overtly far fetched, unrealistic and very dramatic.

 Unadulterated tripe. Pure garbage.

 The Demonization of the American Male

 Who cares?

 Couldn't stomach any more.

 Big Waste of Time

 Lascivious trash about broken people

 Why bother?

 Great book. Awful show.

 Don't understand the good reviews
