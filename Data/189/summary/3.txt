 GRAND BUDAPEST is cute but nothing more

 Slightly better than the average Wes Anderson

 Style. And that's it.

 As far as Wes Anderson goes, one either gets him or one doesn't. I don't.

 Preposterous

 Big disappointment; wasted opportunity.

 fell asleep

 Artsy, foolish- bland

 amateur pretentious twaddle

 Anderson Needs a New Recipe

 " Quite " Boooooooring !!!

 Disappointing. Not Funny

 This is not a comedy :(

 One of those overrated films

 A visually masterful non-sense

 Why did they cut out the scenes with dancing pink elephants?

 Ever noticed a perv is always 'exalted' as they are demonize....

 The Not Too Much Grand Budapest Hotel

 Predictable

 Interesting, But Self-Indulgent
