 A Beautiful Unforgettable Masterpiece that shows the true cost of war.

 The best movie you'll never want to see again

 Haunting

 A masterpiece, whose beauty is often overlooked

 A powerful film that shows the true cost of war

 More moving than you could ever expect

 Brutally honest and heartbreaking

 Heartbreaking...

 Heartbreaking

 Truly Heartbreaking

 Heartrendering, moving masterpiece from Isao Takahata, and a triumph for animation.

 "Hard to recover from, impossible to forget"

 One of the great animation classics.

 They won't make them like this anymore.

 Grave of the Fireflies Review

 Very moving experience

 The most touching movie I ever saw

 Make a grown man cry like a baby!!!

 Best movie you never want to see again

 One for the unknown victims.

 Addressing my fellow reviewers

 Unique combination of Italian neorealism and Yasujiro Ozu's Japanese drama for probably the best animation film out there

 It would be heartless not to like this movie

 A very sad yet powerful movie

 Takahata's Masterpiece
