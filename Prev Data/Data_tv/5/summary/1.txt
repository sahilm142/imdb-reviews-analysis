 Depressing, dull & boring

 Definitely OVER-RATED TV Show EVER!!!!

 The axe and the wobbling camera

 I don't care what anybody says, this show sucks big-time

 This is just wrong

 Boring

 Overrated yawn fest

 Painful...

 Good acting, atrocious writing.

 It's just bad

 Wasted time

 This got to be one of the most over-hyped and overrated shows out there.

 First few episodes are OK, then it's getting more and more stupid

 Overrated!

 Don't waste your time

 Comedy??? Didn't laugh once.

 Watch The Wire instead

 What a god-awful show!

 Brain Dead

 Why does this exist?

 Overrated

 Tread carefully
