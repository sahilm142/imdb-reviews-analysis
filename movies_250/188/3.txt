Although it may seem contradictory due to me writing a rating, I decided to do this anyway. I decided to watch this since it's considered a classic. I'll just be blunt. This movie sucks. I wasted an hour and 28 minutes of my life. Movies this old need to at least capture you in the story since the acting of the 80's and 90's is laughable in modern times. 
Stand By Me is nothing more than a boring story of 4 kids following train tracks to see a dead body. It gives shallow meaning of "young friendship" and feels like a crappy version of The Sandlot. If you want to watch a classic King adaptation, watch Shawshank Redemption instead.Overall recommendation: Don't waste your time.
