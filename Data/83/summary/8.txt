 Depressing

 Brilliant but very disturbing

 The ultimate addiction movie

 Not much glamorous here

 Beautifully horrible

 Requiem for a Dream: more potential than recognized

 Most depressing movie i have ever seen

 Couldn't watch but I couldn't look away

 Didnt know darren aronofsky but now i know !

 Twisted Story from Aronofsky

 Holy Smokes

 A excellent portrayal of the consequences of drug addictions and obsession.

 The most affecting film of all time?

 Very Disturbing !! and Weird !!

 Must Watch

 A giant slap in the face to glamourised drug movies!

 We're all nervous bundles of addictions and vices

 Updated Version of Days of Wine and Roses

 Very nihilistic drug addiction movie....

 It's campy but in a way; effective.
