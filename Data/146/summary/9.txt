 A classic for all the right reasons

 Not what I expected- so much more.

 Brrrraaaaaannnddddooooo

 No. 1 Contender

 Plenty of cheers and jeers for On the Waterfront

 A sensitive performance in a sometimes preachy movie

 Waterfront thugs and Bando tangle.

 An electrifying classic, still a hard-hitter after so many years.

 A deserved masterpiece

 Marlon Brando becomes Hollywood legend

 One of the most powerful and most memorable films that is only helped more by Brando's brilliance

 I thought that they were just gonna lean on him a little not knock him off!

 A Terrific Ensemble and Sizzling Direction Keep This Flawed Classic Watchable

 Just further proof that there will never be another Brando.

 Effortless...

 An old film which still seems so good

 An ex-boxer working as a longshoreman must decide to stand up to his gang-influenced union bosses

 Absolute classic

 They just don't make 'em like they used to

 Great Film!

 Ensemble cast is extraordinary.

 the greatest performance of all time

 Astonishing film driven by powerhouse acting

 A Well Made Masterpiece.

 Godfather level intensity
