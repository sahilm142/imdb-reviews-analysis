 Awesome Show

 Loved the British Original...US version tops it

 Fiona's gotta gooooo

 You should watch this, I mean it

 A Must See

 A Tea Fancy or a Twinky - A treat is a treat.

 This is excellent TV, but not for children or the easily offended

 Wildly, Absolutely, and Unapologetically "Shameless" on All Four Cylinders

 This show rocks

 First 4 season where best

 Horribl--y Funny!

 One of my favorites

 the first season is brilliant, the second is a waste...

 I love it and the British version!

 Not your typical or normal family. They are raw, brash, outrageous, but likable and watchable.

 Shameless is priceless

 For The Most Part...Fabulous!

 Purpose of life is being shameless, in the truest sense, being vulnerable and bold at the same time, challenging the unexpected and realizing the reality around us

 I'm still watching...

 Seen Every Episode

 Phenomenal for first 6 seasons

 Perfect Television. But don't forget..it's TELEVISION

 Better then the English one.

 Fresh ,original ,dramatic ,dark ,funny and great

 FINALLY Got Around To Watching This...
