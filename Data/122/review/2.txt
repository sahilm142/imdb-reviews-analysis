I can't believe this is rated at 8.5. Whatsamatter wiv everyone? Well, we know what the matter is and that is the non thinking response of received ideas, IE. 'this is black and white, this is old, there is a famous actor in it and some famous director who's also renown for something or other I've no idea what but his name is familiar and therefore it must be good, mustn't it?' Personally, I'm not interested in any famous this and that or age or whatever. I wish to be entertained. This doesn't do it. The film starts off with a little promise and you expect to be drawn into a drama full of intrigue and the human condition with a lot of philosophy and conflict. What we actually get is a 2 dimensional 'Boys Own' style clichéd drivel all fragmented plot lines going nowhere. It felt as if the script was written as they went along and hardly any of it seemed to make any sense. There was no drama, just endless amounts of bad acting where the famous actor self consciously and unprofessionally keeps looking at the camera by accident. Basically this film is written for a five year old and insults your intelligence. 2 stars for period nostalgia and the clothes. I'd pass on it if I were you.
