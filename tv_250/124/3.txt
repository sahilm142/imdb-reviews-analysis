I don't know what people mean by "build up" but seriously don't even try to use this word. I watched about 30-35 episodes expecting a good fight here and now and not just one second kills but decent fights. But watching full 30 episodes was too much. As my title mentions i have watched many good animes and those are not so boring and slow as this one. I watched all the major fights on youtube after getting bored. I don't understand all the hype about this anime. Didn't watch the old anime but still this one is too slow and no fun. I know many people say that u have to be patience watch upto this much episode and fun will begin but enough is enough. Even bleach and one piece have boring episodes in between and same goes for dbz and others. But this is not that good for me. And don't tell me to watch the further episodes and all that crap. Lastly the word "build up" is ONLY ONLY SUITED FOR HAJIME NO IPPO. When i watched the anime in the beginning i was like what the hell this is so boring but when the story continued it REALLY BUILT UP and kept building up and especially the last season of it was just so much amazing that i was left so sad. I didn't read Hajime no Ippo's manga as i want to see it in anime. So please don't use the word 'build up' for Hunter x Hunter for its a shame to anime like Hajime No Ippo and also some others like FullMetal Alchemist. Seriously i want to give 1 star but 2 more for animation and remake.
