 One of the most over-rated American films of all time!!!

 Redundant, Sentimentalist Crap

 Schmaltzy patronizing pap, for the most part

 Good if you're looking for something to set your teeth on edge

 Keep your rotten chocolates

 Surest Way to Win an Oscar

 Jon Monsarrat review: an overly sappy soap opera

 Stupid is... anyone who thinks this is a good film.

 A load of anti-intellectual tosh

 One of the most over-rated films of all time.

 Overrated, awful hodgepodge of sentiment

 "Being There", anyone?

 Read the book, avoid the movie

 Life is a box of chocolates!

 Thesis

 Schmaltz is the word.

 A Corny Stinker

 A Long, Difficult Journey

 Thats 2 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back.

 Uhhh

 What is all the hype about?

 It pains me to say this....but this story is really bad.

 Repulsively cheesy

 Best Actor For What
