I Would like to start by saying that from seeing commercials for this show It looked to be entertaining. I've always been a fan of Similar shows such as Rick and Morty, Squillbillies, Aqua Team, Futuram and South Park. But this is just down right awful.The characters voices are more annoying than what I've ever heard on any other animated comedy. This pathetic show tries to take a stab at classic tv shows of the 90's. All of the charectors are just lame alcoholics with nothing interesting going on or anything funny to say.
