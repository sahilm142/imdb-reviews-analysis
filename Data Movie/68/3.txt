I am a huge fan of batman director Christopher Nolan. He is the genius who brought us such groundbreaking films as Memento and Inception, the very good Batman Begins and the excellent The Dark Night.That's why my hopes for this third installment were so high. Boy was i disappointed. This movie is a GRAND MESS. Here are some of the reasons why:Nolan cuts off batman's balls and holds them hostage the entire movie. He is either hobbling around as Bruce Wayne looking like he belongs in a Senior's Home or in his batman's suit trading punches like an aged boxer with MS. No great fight scenes in the inimitable batman style with the whooshing and swooshing and swooping and gadgets and disappearances/reappearances. I would conjecture that this is both because of the post modern philosophy adopted that no man is a true hero (including batman) and also more practically because the fight team was actually changed from the first two movies to a new one for this film, a change drastically for the worse. They should have stuck to the Keysi Fighting Method.Another error is that any movie is only as good as its villain and Bane is a horrible villain. He's really more like a big goon that the main villain usually sends in the eleventh hour to do his bidding like the big Russian guy in the Punisher for example. Don't expect another performance like Ledger's Joker here. What really gets me though, is how the second film developed the whole origin of Twoface as Harvey Dent (who was a great character) and then just dropped it and brought in a much worse villain???? Extremely irritating was Nolan superimposing the Inception style of for example heavy background music etc on this film where it doesn't belong. Even the dialogue was hard to always pick out, especially when you have two of the main characters growling through masks and the war drums right beneath their voices.But it didn't stop there. Nolan invited almost the entire Inception cast and stuck them into this film inflating the story by giving them non- essential roles and by constantly taking you out of the illusion of reality a film is supposed to create when it forces another much better film to come to mind. He and his buds must have been having such a good time on set enjoying the Inception reunion that they must have forgot they were filming an entirely different movie.The cherry on the top of this egregious casting is when in the middle of the film you suddenly have a cameo by none other than Cilian Murphy the scarecrow villain in the first Batman movie as some minor people elected judge. (And yes, you guessed it, he was also in Inception). To me that's tantamount to giving Heath Ledger (Joker) or Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent) a role as a cop or a waiter in this film. Seriously man, is there anything else you can do wrong to break the movie spell and keep reminding me i'm only watching a film with actors- something totally fake?I wish i could stop here but honestly i could go on and on. The movie spends time with characters whose story lines are not that interesting and leads up to a cliché climax that you and i have seen done in previous TV shows like 24 and other films.I believe the production suffered from the all too common problem of having too large a budget (250 million) that enabled Nolan to create a spectacle of "Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing" instead of an interesting film. The film alternates between dragging with boring exposition and blasting your ears off with nonsense. There is a tender moment between Bruce and Alfred that is very brief that was nice though ;)....Guys, I went into the theatre ready to love this film, willing to try to like it, but it never even gave me the chance. Unfortunately it does not live up to the hype. Like the Godfather Part 3, there is no reason to watch it even though you enjoyed the great Parts 1 and 2.Let sleeping dogs lie and let dead films die. For your own sake, do not break the caution tape to watch this wretched bomb of a film.


                
One star for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fresh and believable take on the rookie cop with street smarts, ideals and courage.One star for Anne Hathaway's purr-fect performance as the Catwoman.One star for an aging Michael Caine, in memory of the man who was a king.Beyond that, it's all a murky sea of meaningless explosions, sodden speeches, missed opportunities, and plot holes you could drive the Batmobile through.Some lowlights include . . .A super villain who mumbles so much he might just as well have a sock in his mouth. And speaking of laundry, why can't Bane afford an undershirt? A doctor who explains in clinical detail, with X-rays, exactly why Bruce Wayne can't fight anymore. Just so his fight scenes will feel even more fake than they already did.A pointless half hour in a phony-looking prison in some make believe foreign country where guys walk around all day clapping and chanting. Cool Hand Luke, this ain't. I really didn't care if Bruce Wayne climbed out of that stupid hole with a rope -- but then, the guards didn't seem to care much either. ("Climbin' out of here, boss!" "Yeah, Bruce, climb on out of there.") All I wanted was for Bruce to "prove" himself by eating fifty eggs, like in the Paul Newman classic. And at the end he could send the boys a postcard of him back in Gotham City, wearing a custom-made suit, with his arms around Miranda and Selena Kyle. And the card could just say, "Boys, playing it cool -- Bruce."A staggering total of 3000 cops trapped in a sewer for three months -- yet they all emerge in clean uniforms, in good health, ready to beat Bane's minions in a good old-fashioned street brawl. And even that was more exciting than watching Bane and Batman go one-on-one. This movie could have been twice as good and half as long, with one tenth of the money spent. All it takes is imagination, courage, and respect for the audience.


                
I had no real expectations for this movie but never thought it would be that bad. The tone is sort of alright, but the pacing is terrible, not to mention it just didn't had to be that long. Acting is mediocre at best and the action scenes are unimaginative. Compared to the other two movies its just crap.I believe when it comes to superhero movies in Hollywood they are just generally getting the whole picture wrong. And its especially tricky in the case of Batman since he is also a unique <U+0084>animal" among all the DC and Marvel superheroes since he doesn't have any kind of superpower.You know there is a difference being Batman and a guy wearing a bat costume. There must be a reason why a character dresses like <U+0084>idiot". In the comics and cartoons Batman is intimidating and turns out to be an extremely clever guy, always planning ahead and bringing interesting moral questions into the equasion while Bruce Wayne is like any other generic person. Here Christian Bale is a guy wearing a bat costume and this time there is no Heath Ledger to save the movie. Don't get me wrong its not just the actor's fault, creating a perfect Batman requires the cooperation of the director, the writers etc...Apart from that there are many problems with the movie bu I don't feel the need to list them on a wall of text.


                
Christopher Nolan's new film fails in terms of plot and directing.It has great visuals but it remains just a action movie, nothing more.It's not like Dark Knight anymore, a movie that makes u connect with it and feel the situations.This one is just an action packed movie nothing more. Bane's performance is not good enough ! sometimes u can't even understand what he's saying through his microphone, Heath Ledger killed it with Joker but Tom Hardy fails to create a character for Bane.the film won't even let it's own actors to feel their situations.because there is a short scene and then the next one starts, a very fast paced movie that doesn't live up to the standards of dark knight or other Nolan works.I think this must be one of his worst movies to date.


                
This story has nothing to do with Batman. Batman is not about action-packed large scale wars, where he is just one of several heroes. Batman should be a one man show in a smaller context. In this way, instead, the existential drama typical of Batman is sacrificed in favor of too many distracting elements. The movie starts slowly, trying to develop a story from the ending of the previous installment, but it's not that compelling. Neither Bane is that interesting as an enemy, at the end of the day he's just the same old anarchist tyrant menacing the masses. The exotic setting of the central part of the movie is redundant, it would have been better to leave the asiatic setting of the first movie alone. On the other hand, the ending is good and the Hathaway character is also. Overall, the movie tries to reach an extent that's too much for a Batman story.


                
Not sure what they saw in the screenplay to actually go ahead with this film! Not a particularly compelling plot at all, and most sections just drag and drag on with no pay off. Doesn't really end on much of a note.Standard Nolan film, really. Weak characters, cute time puzzles, decent cinematography and unintelligible sound/dialog mix.


                
I bought the DVD in good expectations, as I was really impressed by Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. To say the least, I want my money back. It's impossible to enjoy the movie unless you really have severe attention problems. Nothing gets properly introduced or explained. Characters come and go. What really put the nail were these things: 1. Robin drives a bus with10 kids like a hero and fails like a retard. What? 10 kids or so? What the... 2. Let us solve our issues on ice. And, oh, I quickly took a few tons of gas to draw a bat on the bridge and poured some to light it up in a convenient path from wherever you conveniently drop the torch, AND ALL THAT WHILE WE'RE ALL ON ICE IN A SECOND. 3. Wat? Things just not get explained. Inception much? I thought this was Batman. He ended up being a puss.
I don't normally review movies unless I feel compelled to do so. In this case, I feel I was duped into expecting a very good movie. Isn't that what I should have expected with an 8.5/10 rating?I won't get into the details, they're well-documented throughout these reviews. And I won't detail the nonsense that is considered a plot for those that may not have had the displeasure of viewing this movie. There are so many times that I was left shaking my head that I sustained a neck injury just watching this.I like the idea of Bane as a physically powerful foe, I like Anne Hathaway as Catwoman (although her character has serious flaws) and the veterans do their normal commendable job attempting to bring stability to this disaster.I gave it a 3 because I like Batman and I still want to like him. I will put this movie out of my mind so that I continue to like him.


                
What a mess. This is one of Nolan's weakest movies and definitely the worst in the Batman trilogy.I didn't expect much from the trailer, but it was even worse than I thought. It's not terrible, but it's not a good film either.The characters were uninteresting, plot was a mess, lots of useless fighting scenes. Tom Hardy's talent was wasted and Bane character isn't even 1% as strong or as interesting as the Joker. Most of all I liked Michael Caine's performance, but that was brief and the editor rushed his few scenes too.Oh, and the movie is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Did they really need 3 hours to tell this mess???


                
Batman is among my favorite childhood superheroes and I used to collect his comic books when I was a child. Therefore, I am a fan and I always look forward to see Batman movies.I had the greatest expectation with "The Dark Knight Rises" due to the IMDb Rating and the hype surrounding this movie. Unfortunately it is a completely overrated and boring feature with stupid characters and situations in an awful and ridiculous story. We were in four watching the DVD and neither one of us liked this flick. Batman should have taken the director and the writers of this crap together with the bomb and detonate them. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas Ressurge" ("Batman: The Dark Knight Rises")


                
I really liked the first two. I did. It was clear from the first gratuitous, plot-crushing soliloquy of Michael Cane (there were four in total) that this was headed for disaster: a disaster that even Anne Hathaway in black latex couldn't save. There was unintelligible dialogue from everyone, especially Gary Oldman; Bane never had a chance to be understood, with that auto-tune mask set to 'distort' on his face. People around me were constantly asking, "what did he say?" What little action and Bat-gadgetry there was just couldn't save this bloated failure. The names 'Waterworld' and 'Indiana Jones 4' will justifiably be raised in comparison. I really liked the first two. I did.


                
When Bane sees the Batman burning sign on the wall he utters" "Impossible", that's pretty much sums up most of this last chapter to Batman trilogy that began so great in the last two films.This last chapter was very very disappointing?. First lets look at the casting of "Anne Hathaway" as the so-called "Cat Woman"?. That was the biggest joke to me in the whole film. Anne Hathaway was trying so hard to play this street wise tough chick; almost over acting her scenes that just got worse. I am sorry to say she is not much to look at physically or in the face, with all the make up and sexy outfit; her over-acting with her fight scenes was just awful. I don't know how people get casted in a movie as are large as this, maybe its all about the right agent who can make the deals with people like director Nolan.Nolan did something similar in the second Batman by casting "Maggie Gyllenhaal" as Rachel by replacing "Katie Holmes" due to her pregnancy, but again Maggie Gyllenhaal was a miscast, she did not have the gracefulness and poise of the character of "Rachel" who grew up like Bruce Wayne. Nolan casting "Maggie Gyllenhaal" as Rachel is as bad as casting "Anne Hathaway" as Cat Woman. My choice would have been "Olivia Wilde" who is visually stunning to look at, as a Cat Woman should be. Olivia Wilde has a also has done films like "Tron Legacy", where she is physically capable of a such a role. The second casting errors were "Joseph Gordon-Levitt", who is working a lot these days, I just could not see him as "John Blake" and John Blake does not become "Robin" in the Batman story. There was also "Matthew Modine" who really just walked through this film, he was awful even playing dead at the end.As far as the story, that's where it gets really bad and pot holes one after another. My first issue was why did we start 8 years into future, it's been four years since the last film, that is plenty of time for Batman to have gone missing. There is a scene where Batman goes to the hospital to see his doctor and his doctor shows him X-rays in how how badly he is hurting all over, he has no Cartilage in his knees along other issues such as even liver. So here is you are given information that Batman is not well. yet two minutes he is jumping out the window to see his old friend Commissioner Gordon, who is the most consistent character in all 3 films.So we have been informed that Bruce Wayne's injuries being Batman has finally caught up with him. Yet, when he has the fight scene with Bane, when Bane brakes his back and puts him the Pit of a prison. This is where the film really gets stupid; there is a time issue in this film from the time Batman has a broken back to the time he makes it back to Gotham. Again remember he is already in poor health with now a broken back, then his back heals very quick, then he tries to climb the pit and fails again with a bad back again, the he recovers so well to jump with a with out rope in a such a short time to make it back to Gotham. That is as Bane said best: IMPOSSIBLE.Then there is the character of "Thalia" or Miranda, the daughter of Ra's Al Ghul. When Batman was beaten by Bane, she is still pretending to be Miranda; yet Bane has already taken over the city, she has no reason to pretend anymore, she has all she wants to destroy Gotham. Again, how long was Miranda/Thalia in custody while Batman healed?.It can not be 3 or 5 months considering the time the cops were trapped in the tunnel below, this is the biggest plot hole in the whole film. When Batman got stabbed by Miranda and sitting there listening her while she has the knife in him?. This is not a reaction of Batman who beats 10 men at a time; so no matter how shocking it was to find out she is the daughter of his former enemy, was it so hard to push her off when she is talking to him, considering Bane is also down and helpless?.There was several scenes and references to the "Auto Pilot" of the Bat plane that has none. Yet we see the plan blow up while it drops the Atomic bomb, so where ever Batman jumped off in less two minutes of the bomb going off while in mid air it has to be a fast jump to survive, given the radiation of radius of a atomic bomb, again as Bane would say: IMPOSSIBLE. We are given this last sinister look of Batman while he looks at the sky as he explodes, we later see him in European Cafe across from Albert had mentioned. This is where I think the film really failed, why can't Batman die, why does he had to live? I really liked the character of Bane, I wish there was more scenes with him and Thalia to show her attraction to this insane character. However, we spent too much time with characters like "Blake" and others like special ops caption Jone played by Daniel Sunjata, who got killed as soon he was on the screen, what was the purpose of these characters?I really don't know what happened with Nolan and what he was thinking when he did this last fill of Batman series? . When you watch this it makes you wonder if this is the same director who made the last two films, its really was a failure and poor way to end a great trilogy.


                
The Dark Knight Rises was the worst out of the three. Now I know all you fan boys are going to attack me but let me explain. I liked Batman Begins and The Dark Knight they are great movies. Dark Knight Rises felt rushed. Christopher Nolan is a great director but is very overrated. It didn't seem like a movie he would do it seem like what George Lucas would do if he made a batman movie. Lets go threw the movie now. It starts out where Bane is hijacking a plane. Bane sounds like Sean Connery and Ernest Borgnine in a Darth Vader voice. After that Bruce Wayne is hiding up in his room while a party is going on to celebrate the anniversary of Harvey Dent's death. Catwomen happens to be there and I'm I the only person that thinks Ann Hathaway is the worst Catwomen? (not including the bad 2004 movie) Alfred is crying to Bruce to stop acting like a weirdo trapped in your room for 7 years and get a life! So Bruce does. He meets some girl who I forgot what her name was. Bane is attacking a stock market place so Bruce dresses up as Batman which he hasn't done in a long time to stop them. Bruce meets Bane threw a tunnel underground. Bane beats Bruce to death and takes him to a country which they don't explain and throws him in a pit with dirty old men that feeds him chips dipped in water. (was I the only one that noticed that) So Bane threatens Gotham with a bomb by reading a letter by Commissioner Gordon saying he covered up Harvey Dents crimes. In this scene he sounds like Bill Cosby. So he yells who wants to know who will join him. Oh yeah sorry I forgot he blew up a football field. Bruce sees Ras Al Goul and tells him his son is Bane. Bruce tries climbing out of the pit. The men cheer him so he eventually does. Why were there TV's in the pit, how did they get them down there, where does it connect? So less than 5 minutes Bruce shows up. How did he get out of there that fast?! He teams up with Catwomen they try stopping the bomb. Batman fights Bane but Miranda stabs Bruce and says she's the daughter of Ras Al Goul. Catwomen blows up Bane and the go after the bomb. There's a character in the movie named John Blake who is a cop that helps Batman. Batman has no choice but to sacrifice his life to save Gotham. Batman in his plane straps a bomb to it and than gets blown up and dies. They sell off Wayne manor and Blake goes into the police station to quit being a cop and the lady says Robin is a good name because that's his nick name. He goes to the Bat cave. Alfred is sitting in a restaurant and see's Bruce in there with Catwomen and rolls to the credits. This movie was better than the Amazing Spiderman but The Avengers was just awesome!


                
Well,managed to get through the two hours and forty five minutes!Not much of batman in it....... not for those that had to pay to see it.And Robin? Where was Robin?In this version of a very popular comic book hero Robin spends the movie as a cop.There was not really any plot,the acting was below standard and even for a batman flick a lot of the scenes were totally unrealistic.Also the bad guy Bane was lame.Is that all Hollywood could come up with?A bloody joke and a waste of money.This has been the way of many movies over the last few years.As the viewing technology gets better and better,what comes out of Hollywood gets worse and worse.$250,000,000 to make Batman?.....that has to be a typical Hollywood exaggeration,What a load of rubbish!For a movie with some great special effects it was boring.


                
People, people. Please stop with "This movie was so awesome!", oh I have to believe this movie was so good, and I have to repeat it because of the tragedy associated with it. It was not that good.(period) My bottom line for critiquing a movie is entertainment value. when I see a movie, I want to be entertained. I don't want to be preached too. I don't want political messages sandwiched and purposely slid into the creases of the movie. I don't want to be made to feel guilty about the environment or some filmmakers, or the Hollywood types personal agenda.So, based solely on the entertainment factor, I was disappointed. The first problem I had was with "Bain". Really? Was this guy kicked in the nuts? what was the deal with his Vienna boys choir voice? Whenever he talked I half expected him to break out into a monologue of Shakespeare. A villain should have some fear factor. It was so bad I was pre-occupied with thoughts of - what pro wrestler did they hire to play this guy?, and who's voice did they use to dub over this goon?, and why doesn't it match up? Make me afraid of this guy!!!!! Secondly, the special effects were......sad. When the highlights of the special effects are the motorcycle turning 90 degrees and having the wheels flip over?.....Really? Usually excellent special effects can hide some deficiencies in story and plot. Was I missing something? Next, there were excellent actors but they had nothing to work with. Lets do 500 really quick scenes and not spend any time exploring anything. Lets spend all the plot capital on Bain, and Bruce trying to climb out of a hole? And then have the the men in the bottom of the hole chant, "rise, rise, rise, rise." How genius! Now we can title the movie " The dark night.......Rises" Oh awesome, that makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. The title makes so much sense now.Lets also write a really bland part for "Robin" and have him become the scout leader or some kind of weird babysitter for the orphan boys.(can't wait for the next installment with creepy and other than masculine Robin.) The gal that played Catwoman? Didn't work for me. Couldn't take my eyes off her freaky collarbone that the pearl necklace perched eerily on. I think I could stack books on that thing.Obviously four years was long enough for Nolan to lose what ever magic he had early on in this trilogy. I guess when the first one was so awesome, it's inevitable that it's going downhill from there. I was not entertained comparative to the amount of money spent. Save yourself twenty bucks and wait for it on DVD! You can put a label on a pile of pooh, and call it batman whatever, but it's still a pile of pooh. Unless you drank the, oh there was a tragedy so that immediately makes this movie awesome - kool-aide. The real tragedy is that i saw this movie on purpose!


                
Quick short comment; DARK KNIGHT RISES is boring, the action scenes are not interesting and the plot is absurd. Acting is fine but some dialogues are unintelligible. Now; let's expand: - At almost three hours, this movie pace is terrible. - Action scenes are very spaced but not spectacular (aside from a few mass movements the rest is pretty rudimentary). Even the airplane highjack, publicized as made without digital effects, does not look that impressive. - Most of the actors deliver; but trying to understand Michael Caine long diatribes or even Tom Hardy behind Bane's mask requires a lot of effort. - There are outstanding performances like Gary Oldman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the real heroes and most developed characters. Anne Hathaway gets easily away with the treacherous CAT WOMAN and Marion Cotillard completely take over the screen when she is in it. Last, the plot; even fantasy requires a logic; but this is not the case here. In order to justify the revolution and kaos, Nolan created a series of unrealistic events: - A respected senator, gives up everything after a few hours of meeting CAT WOMAN; and an army of SWAT teams, appears in a matter of seconds after someone use the senator's phone. - A computer scam puts a billionaire in state of bankruptcy in a matter of hours; causing even his car to be repossessed - Why taking over Wayne's company when Bane knows everything about everything; even BATMAN's identity. - The newcomer Blake, knows BATMAN identity; but the police chief has no hint at all (even when he ask somebody to contact Bruce Wayne about BATMAN). - What is logic on taking over a city to be blown up three months later? . Besides; what GOTHAN has to do with the personal vendetta behind all this ?. It is not the first time, Goyer's writing breaks logic just to justify some event and Nolan did the same in INCEPTION making the last act absurd; but this time the went as far as breaking almost every possible logic just to make the movie darker and force twists. It is even worse (or lame) that following up on the previous movie; they insist on stating that real facts should be hidden for the common people and the creation of FAKE IDOLS (heroes) are necessary to keep society controlled (a very fascist concept also used by Stalin ).
This movie should be morphed into a cartoon for kids 7-10 years old. I can't believe that people are allowed to spend so much money making trash like this. And that we still go to see it. Heartless acting ridiculous screenplay and dialogue. Poor production, could barely understand what anyone was saying but so what ....what they were saying we've heard in every other film of this type anyway. And the scene development was chaos. I never knew what was happening or why. When the cops attacked Bane's men who were armed with automatic weapons as opposed to the cops with flashlights and steel bars what a joke, they never fired their weapons!. My advise is don't go to see this shovelled manure anymore at the theaters for $9-12 ea. Rent it if you really need to see it. Also how much of a weepy Michael Caine can anyone take?


                
I can't remember the last time I found myself fidgeting in my chair feeling uncomfortable in a movie. This movie honestly felt long and once that feeling sank in you endured the remainder of the film. I found myself at points unable to keep my attention on the movie and was actually looking around the theatre.The franchise would have been better off ending with the Dark Knight or taking their time to get this movie right.This ranks as the worst super-hero movie of the summer in my opinion. This was not a movie that I got all hyped up about, it's one that I thought I might enjoy if they followed the same formula as the Dark Knight. It's really sad to see a director get one film so right and then turn around and fall flat on his face into the piles of money that we gave him in the hopes of receiving entertainment.I would definitely not want to see this in theatres again, I don't think many others would either based on the maybe 5 people who clapped at the end.


                
It's not easy to make a good film. Thats why people can be so passionate about film that evoke real emotion when they are gripped by plots which enthral them, characters who touch them and themes that are instantly absorbing and recognisable. Not many individuals can attain par excellence in story telling, as it is a finely balanced art that little understand yet alone can duplicate frivolously. If any such individual today can create masterpieces of entertainment, then Christopher Nolan should surely be high up on the list. I had high expectations of a movie that would be well sculpted, like an old master who delicately forms his creation with a finesse that only years of experience and an absolute love of their work can produce, but not so. Here's why...The movie seemed hurried, despite me willing it to end during the last half hour and it being almost three hours long! It felt overly scripted and complex like the script writers were tying too much almost. There was no real enticing flow to the narrative and there were far too many side plots happening simultaneously which was tiresome and frustrating to follow in a 'blink and you've missed it' way. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacking substance at times with no real emotion in them. The plot twist did surprise me, however, I felt it lacked creativeness and credibility due to the poor character development. Character development was a weakness which plagued the movie. Some characters seemed underdeveloped and unconvincing and whats more I felt the actors thought this too, as proved exceptional acting talent seemed unable to deliver the gritty realism that they are renowned for with more than one lacklustre performance.So what's good about the movie?Visually it ticks all the boxes, dazzling your senses with big bold cinematic cityscapes, pyrotechnic frenzies of explosions and an atmospheric melancholy that visually captures Waynes persona perfectly and harks back to the previous movies, establishing the new film as being cut from the same cloth. A credit to the camera/production crew. The special effects also showed the skill of some of Hollywood's best graphic talent, not cheap. Amongst the humdrum of acting lethargy there were some Sterling performances, mainly in the form of Bale who's inspired acting manages to not get dragged down by the wooden staleness surrounding him at times.To sum up...It felt like a poor effort and a typical Hollywood 'money in the bank' job. (Commercial exploitation of previous greatness which is to be expected and frankly, who wouldn't? The film industry is a business after-all) You'll still watch it though. I hope Nolan's next work is not pressured from the money men and his creativity is given the unfettered freedom it deserves. Ultimately this movie should make you realise what an extraordinary talent Heath Ledger truly was.Thanks for reading!


                
When I heard that this movie would come out I was filled with excitement since I love and own the first two. However when I saw this movie I was bored for the majority of it and completely disappointed. I you are expecting this to be as good as the Dark Knight beware it is not. Batman has very little screen time and the only reason it is thought of as good is because of it predecessors. IF this movie were to stand alone without the rest of the trilogy it would be recognized for what it is, a failure. I found the film very uninteresting, it goes like this. Bruce is old and a new villain arrives, Bruce puts on the mask and is defeated and sent to a prison hole in the middle east. The villain decides to blow up Gotham to complete the league of shadows mission. Ra's Al Ghul kicked Bane out yet Bane and later revealed Talia want to blow up Gotham even though it is a good city now which doesn't need to be annihilated, but they decide to do it anyway. The cops and Bane go all out and Batman returns from the middle east "somehow" to find out that bane is a subordinate and dies soon after as well as his leader Talia Batman then says his autopilot doesn't work so he takes the bomb on a bat-plane he randomly has now and we see the bomb explode only to find out that Bruce is alive. And all that takes nearly three hours with everything else that happens boring you to death. I love batman and Nolans work ,but this movie just really let me down.
I know I'm swimming against a tide of opinion which lauds this is a great movie, but for a number of reasons it fell very flat for me. Though I am a big fan of Director Christopher Nolan, I'm afraid a number of factors conspire to bring down his latest attempt to portray the iconic Super-hero, some of these factors being, in fairness, beyond his control. The first problem is merely the "jaded" factor; this is the 7th Batman Feature film in 24 years, not to mention an animated series and at least 3 feature-length animated movies. That isn't any fault of Christopher Nolan, though he seems to try to address it by making The "Dark Knight Rises" the biggest most intense Batman experience to date, and that in itself becomes a problem. Where Tim Burton's adaptation gets a balance of intensity while not taking itself too seriously, Nolan badly over-cooks it. Christian Bale's voice is so "growly" that it goes beyond dark and scary, and ends up just sounding like throat cancer. The next big problem for me is the character of Bane; Bane is the ultimate bad-ass on the comic page, in fact he's the guy who brings Batman down. Because in the world of Cinema this isn't allowed to happen (don't want to give away too much about the movie) Bane, instead of ratcheting up the intensity, ends up looking a bit bland and impotent. Next problem is plot-line. Okay, its a superhero move; I shouldn't be expecting Hamlet here, but among other problems the whole idea of holding Gotham City for ransom for months on end is both ridiculous and kills the pace of the movie, making it stagnant. Which brings us to the next problem; movie was way too long! A talented editor could have cut out a lot of unnecessary scenes, moved the action on quicker and made it a better movie in under 2 hours. We'll overlook the problem of the bad guy who, instead of killing the hero instantly, sends him off to die slowly and presumes all goes well. As Dr. Evil would say "You just don't get it, Scottie." And my final gripe is a shocking performance by the usually great Michael Cane (Bale, Oldman and Hathaway are merely acceptable, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy were, in fairness, very good). All in all these problems for me made this movie far less than the sum of its parts. This isn't the worst Batman movie, but its far from the best.
Batman is crippled by the total lack of connective tissue in every joint. He overcomes this irreversible infirmity by doing intense physical exercise while starving to death with a broken back... not the only ridiculous plot failing, just the major one for me. There was so much unnecessary character back story eating away screen time, and mostly for disposable characters not important to the current plot whatsoever. Since, with Batman incapacitated the majority of the film, a lot of the story focused on the Robin character. It might as well have ended with a "to be continued" slap in the face like Matrix Reloaded
I had great expectations when I went to see this one. After 30 min I was thrilled, thinking this would be the best of the 3 Batman movies by C Nolan, then after 1 hour I was bored, just watching the watch to see how much more I had to suffer through this over pretentious movie.Not to mention deaf by the way too (much) loud sound effects, and struggling to hear Batman's voice (warf warf) and Bane's metallic one.And Bane?? Even Kick Ass would ... kick his ass .... easily, not to mention what Hit Girl would do to such a lame villain.Hugely disappointing movie that I had looked forward to for months to see, good thing I didn't spend more of my money seeing it at IMAX. For ones, most of the newspaper reviews got it right, and film magazines as Total Film and Empire got it all wrong (they do more and more, just see what they wrote about "worst movie of the last 1 years" Kill List).


                
What can I say about the year's most anticipated finale to an utterly exceptional trilogy (well, exceptional for two-thirds of it)? Lots of things and few of them positive. I saw this as part of a triple-billing. So I dare say that a combination of factors prevented my enjoyment – perhaps the late night, the freshness in my mind of its two fantastic prequels, or simply the strain of sitting through over nine hours of ear-piercing action. Whatever it was, I'm sorry to say that TDKR has left me baffled, frustrated and completely unsatisfied. Spoilers abound herein.I'll begin with the solitary aspect of the film that WAS done well. Bane was awesome. Outdoing the Joker was never going to be an easy feat, and no, he doesn't really outdo him, but he manages to be a scary character in his own right without ever making you think, "Man, I wish the Joker was back." Nothing will ever erase memories of the Joker, but you're able to accept Bane as a totally different character in a whole new story, rather than just a crude remodelling of his predecessor. He is a little hard to understand at times, but in my opinion that just made him even scarier. The accent, the voice, the half-covered face, the unbeatable strength, the fact that he's unclouded by remorse, conscience or delusions of morality – he was a brilliant, bad-ass villain played to chilling perfection by the wonderfully changeable Tom Hardy.Sadly, he was the only well-written feature on-show, and as the whole show is not all about him, that should tell you something about the rest of the film's writing. Christopher Nolan is one clever cookie. He wrote Inception. The Prestige. MEMENTO, for God's sake. He is normally very careful to avoid plot holes, inconsistencies and things that aren't tied up very well. All three glitches are shamelessly paraded here. The gist of the storyline goes something like this: Batman begrudgingly returns to the superhero business after retiring at the end of TDK, but soon has bigger problems on his hands than Gotham City's devious fiends; his enterprise has been hijacked, causing him to lose all of his money. He tries not to let it break his spirit, but after being beaten to a bloody pulp by Bane, is sent to a grimy prison outside the country – where, after a series of nonsensical healing procedures (how does one recover from a broken back that easily?), he must learn to regain his power, agility and, most crucially, concern for humanity. Once better, he returns to Gotham to stop Bane, whose posse has taken over the town and brought quite a literal hell on Earth to its residents. So...ahem...how did he get out of the country when he's broke? How did he get back INTO the country when he's broke? Did he have a spare credit card on him that hadn't been affected by the liquidation? How'd he get back in when Bane had irrevocably closed off every perimeter of Gotham to ensure that nobody could escape or enter? There's even a scene where Alfred does something that the Alfred whom we all know and love would never, ever do – gives up on Bruce and resigns from his service. He then disappears for the last half of the film and doesn't reappear until just two minutes left to go. Where...the HELL...did he go all of that time?And oh, the endless enigmas of Catwoman. I love Anne Hathaway, but her involvement in this film didn't work for me either. She starts off exasperating as a character and ends even worse. Now I knew going into it that she'd been described as more of an anti-hero than a villain, so I prepped myself for the inescapability that she was always going to be tricky to figure out. But that, too, is spewed out at the wrong angle. It actually infuriates me that, by the end of the film, they try to convince you that she's not really a bad person per se; she's secretly a hard yet soulful person thrown into bad situations that she must use any means to escape from. What pathetic, complete and utter horses***. She chooses to do everything that she does. She slinks through the film using just about every idiotic excuse you can think of to justify her actions – including the perennial favourite "A girl has to eat"; honey, you can't eat diamonds – and is even the primary cause of Batman being left for dead at the hands of Bane, something over which she shows no regret later. And her reason? Something along the lines of "They were gonna kill me." This coming from the woman who shows in several previous scenes that she's capable of taking down whole roomfuls of guys. But when it comes to risking the life of Gotham's most imperative hero, there's no way that she can get out of it? And Bruce's constant forgiving of her, all because he believes that "there's more to her than what shows on the surface" or some sentimental bullcrap, just makes him look like a d***less idiot. He is never once given ANY reason to think this. Would he be asserting the same outlook if she was a guy? I ended up losing respect for him on these grounds. And there's another problem - Batman just isn't Batman in this outing. Worst of all, her scenes were predictable. Anybody with an IQ higher than their shoe size would know why she kisses Bruce after dancing with him in an early scene. This trick is like 60 years old. How could the Caped Crusader fall for it? And the kiss that they share later is equally stupid because, well..."MORONS! THERE'S A BOMB ABOUT TO ERADICATE THE ENTIRE CITY!" Ruurgh.My two cents. Now I'm gonna go watch The Room. At least the plot holes in that film were funny.
After raising the bar so high with The Dark Knight Nolan drops said bar with nerve shattering force with The Dark Knight Rises. To say that I had high hopes for Nolans 3rd go at The Bat would be criminally understating the obvious.How could it be bad?!?!?The man had plenty of time to hash out a good script & the full support of the studio behind him.It has taken me months to bounce back from the disappointment I felt after seeing TDKR.If this movie was rushed into production a month after The Dark Knight I might have been able to excuse some of the glaring issues.Maybe.I honestly don't even know where to begin.****************SPOILERS******************** 1.Batman spends 8 years out of commission over a failed romance & no one notices that both Batman & Bruce Wayne disappeared at the same time. 2.No cartilage no problem just wear this bat bionic brace thingy & you'll be punching holes in brick walls like a champ. 3.Robin knocks on his door & says hey I know your Batman let me in & lets talk about it.OK sure come on in. 4.Catwoman has the dumbest subplot.Worse than the entire Halle Berry feature. 5.Robins name is not Robin. 6.Alfred quits?!?!?!? 7.Batman is broken in half.His spine is broken yet through the magical healing hands of a a deranged prison masseur & some push ups hes up & running in no time. 8.Somehow Bane manges to fly Bruce to the ass end of the world to drop him in a hole then fly all the way back in what 24 hours?A week?Hello continuity! 9.With no friends no money no assets somehow Bruce fully healed crawls out of Banes hole & what walks back to Gotham?Hitchhikes? Gotham is under siege & taken over by terrorists & the rest of the world just does nothing.Really?! 10.More than half of the police force charges into the sewers after Bane & are trapped which has got to be the dumbest thing I've seen on screen since Ernest escaped from jail. 11.When the trapped officers escape MONTHS later they are showered shaved & fit for an epic battle in the snowy streets of Gotham. 12.Instead of oh I don't know planning to take back Gotham they just charge at them with sticks. 13.Longest detonation time for a bomb ever! 14.The second best detective after Batman Gordon is STUNNED to find out Bruce & (SPOILER) Batman are one & the same.Nevermind that EVERYONE in Gotham seems to have figured it out. 15.Bruce kills The Bat & runs away with Catwoman leaving EVERYTHING to Robin. ****************END SPOILERS********************* These are just the most glaring problems to me.There are so so many that I would be here for hours detailing every last one. This is a skilled team of film makers at work here.These plot problems continuity issues & poorly written characters should be at a minimum not at an accelerated high.Sure some of these issues I have are personal but most of them are technical.The Dark Knight Rises is a BAD movie people.This isn't the fault of the actors involved or shockingly the studio.Nolan & company have delivered a well polished turd & it seems that mostly people are very satisfied with it.Which is baffling on so many levels.Now I waited for them to release the bluray thinking maybe we would get a directors cut that at least tryed to reconcile the problems with this movie but nope.Nolan truly believes he delivered a masterpiece & thats that.I want to watch The Dark Knight Rises at least one more time with commentary.I just have to hear its creators try to skirt or justify this mighty mess of a failure.
