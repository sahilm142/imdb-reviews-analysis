 Solid cartoon laughably overrated by a cancerous fanbase of loser 12 year olds and cringe worthy man-children

 Weird, wild stuff....

 Hit or Miss, unfortunately

 Pretty okay

 Original unique but

 Good but not great

 Season THREE curses!

 Not bad

 A perfectly average show in a not-so-average show.

 Rick and Morty: season one and two

 Good overall, overrated though
