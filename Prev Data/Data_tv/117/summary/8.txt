 Fluid direction, crisp script, helmed by trio of fine performances

 Great Cast and Great Plot

 Pretty damn good for an American remake

 Hanging out with the Gallaghers

 A Showtime Delight

 Finally a US remake that gets the original...

 Whats shameless

 Outstanding! Outrageous!

 Well acted but hard to watch

 Good Show!

 Far fetched but entertaining!

 How You Treat People Matters

 Shameless is one of my favorite shows ever!

 Must-watch television.

 Awesome and very entertaining show

 Reminds me of my all time favourite

 ups and downs

 Not the best or worst season yet.

 Huge fan of the series

 Awesome Show but hope its heading in the right direction

 lives up to the name!

 One of Showtime's best

 Absolutely Love The Show

 A fuckup beyond the capacity of the modern mind to process

 Is it shameful to like shameless
