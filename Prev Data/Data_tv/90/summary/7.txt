 Competent and educating but (almost) never exciting

 Strange nostalgia for "good old times"?

 Nice to look at but just a meringue

 "Stately as a galleon......................."

 relaxing TV show if you ignore the actual historical background

 Definitely worths your time

 Highly flawed but decent

 Early seasons were easily 10, by the end a 7

 Downton Abbey Final Season Disappointment

 Technically perfect but oddly sexless

 Downton Abbey 2012 – Review

 Uptown Downtown, Upside Downside

 Entertaining enough

 A Look At The English Class System

 Downton Abbey

 An Edwardian British Soap Opera!

 Honestly, good fun but not an 8++
