 Flawed, very entertaining solid third sequel an epic conclusion to the original trilogy!

 a good film but I thought it fell in places

 A fine ending - especially after having seen Episode III

 Return of the viewing.

 Hey, still one of the best

 Has anyone else noticed a certain trend ...

 Very good but inferior to the others

 Sign of things to come

 "And now, young Skywalker... you will die."

 Emotionally satisfying, but not quite as good as its predecessors

 Maybe it is not as good as it's predecessors but it's still a great film that gives a satisfying ending to the trilogy

 fine wrap-up

 Nice end to the original trilogy.

 A celebration of all things "Star Wars"

 A fitting end

 Completes an epic trilogy

 A satisfying conclusion

 A fitting ending to the original ending

 The main conclusions...

 A decent ending to the first trilogy.

 Hopes emerges with Jedi

 Easily the weakest of the original films, but not a bad finish

 Mostly Good

 The second best Star Wars film to date!

 Action packed, snazzy end to the trilogy
