 Idiotic

 Batman Bores

 Huge disappointment...

 The fact this film received 8.6 suggests just how the public has lost their touch with film.

 Promising new Batman film ruined by a fatal flaw

 Massive disappointment

 Boring

 Terrible sound mix and appalling cinematography ruin a good thing

 "Batman Begins" after 8 years . . . but was it worth it?

 Over-hyped rubbish

 its batman...a batman we have all seen

 Overrated

 But what three!

 New problems begin, does that make it better?

 A major disappointment.

 strangely enough, this movie is both disturbing and tedious

 This movie is a piece of crap

 Don't Believe The Hype

 Painfully Boring

 dung

 Batman Bond

 No Continuity with ANY other Batman film

 Should have been called "Batman Bombs."

 Batman was horribly disappointing. And just horrible in general.

 If this were by any other director it wouldn't have been as disappointing.
