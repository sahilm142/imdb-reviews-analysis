 Possibly the best thing to ever happen to television

 Possibly the best British show ever!!!

 If you were born between 1970 and 1980...

 Best British comedy ever!

 I am in love with this program!

 Fantastic early work from Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, Nick Frost and co.

 This is my generation...

 10 out of 10

 SPACED is Out of Sight!

 "Timmy...fetch me my tools..."

 Excellent Comedy

 Everything television should be

 Not your typical Sitcom

 Really good, can't believe I waited 20 years to watch this,

 Ahead of its time...

 Spaced is a revolutionary super-comedy made from bacon-coated gold. Now here's why.

 Awesome

 a post modern jungle

 Very clever, very funny

 Warning: this can induce a coma from laughing

 There will never again be a programme as brilliant as this
