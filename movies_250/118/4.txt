honestly the main character reminded me more of a belushi than a masterless swordsman.  the action was short, fast, and not good.  the only redeeming quality was the main character was always calm and controlled even when confronted.  i will not be renting the sequel.  i give it 5 out of 10.


                
Mifune is great in the film but the film itself isn't brilliant
