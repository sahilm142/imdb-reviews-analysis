 The Best Show on TV

 All Around BRILLIANT Show!

 The show made me like the serial killer was spoiled by its 8th season...

 Dexter: The new anti-hero? (spoilers for pilot episode)

 "(...) Argentina is just Argentina."

 I have seen many TV shows, never seen anything like DEXTER!

 One Nightmare of a Dreamboat....

 Never thought I'd root for the murderer.

 Slice of life

 Instantly Addictive

 Best show I never expected to like

 Awesome series, bad ending (last minutes).

 Vexed by Dexter...

 Loosing the charm..

 Dexter: The ultimate nature versus nurture?

 Dexter is seriously great! A viciously entertaining show. (Review for Seasons 4-8, Minor Spoilers) Part 2 of 2
