 Too slow and repetitive

 Why??

 Over-hyped series. Not impressed

 Too heavy

 Not quite a binge worthy show...

 BOO !! (oops, I mean ...boo hoo)

 Very slow moving

 Revised review-really can't get into it.

 The horror resides within the writing

 Boring and tedious

 Seriously, WTF??

 Suffered thru 6 episodes of this terrible show.

 Painfully dull.

 Disappointing Pilot episode

 Lifetime Channel Horror

 Not a Horror Series, A Ten Part Drama

 Only manged 5 episodes

 Disappointed. Believe the lower reviews.

 Has moments but terribly disappointing last episode

 Expected horror, got a melodrama about drug users and family life filled with lesbian sex

 Don't understand the hype

 Am i missing something?!!!!

 Neither horrow, no suspense. Boring dripping.

 Drama

 Pacing turns it into a lackluster show
