 Surprised

 Good but not great

 Follow the gold

 Gold Rush

 A Chaplin triumph?

 A Classic Chaplin Flick

 Cabin Fever

 One of the best films by Charles Chaplin and of the silent movie era

 The Gold Rush

 Aged, but with some great moments

 The least essential Chaplin?

 Cute story with great composition.

 A charming little silent movie from a legend

 The Gold Rush - My Overall Thoughts

 Solid funny Chaplin film

 Funny like crazy

 "And in that cabin, his secret was revealed..."

 Not Chaplin's Best

 Slapstick Humor At It's Best

 Good, Simple Comedy

 a man on a mission
