 A terrible waste

 An insult and mockery of a musical genius.

 Mozart not American!

 Jealousy can destroy a career, but not divine talent

 I have never understood why this film garnered the accolades it did.

 Best Picture?

 Great music,over rated movie

 disgusting

 If you're some musical person, watch it, otherwise, I think it's a bad movie.
