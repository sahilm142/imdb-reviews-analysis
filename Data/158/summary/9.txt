 The Genius of Buster Keaton

 Loco and Motive

 It is more appreciated now than when it was released

 Keaton is lovable and talented

 Johnnie Gray is the ancestor of Charlie Chaplin

 Laughs and Thrills

 Even After a Century, Buster Keaton's 'The General' Has Lost None of Its Steam!

 My general feeling about the film is that it was one of the greatest movies, hands down.

 "Undoubtedly the best train film ever made"

 The best silent movie of all time.

 A Real Gem

 The Great Locomotive Chase

 One of His Best Films

 A classic of silent cinema

 Buster's best!

 Classic example of Keaton

 A Classic piece of Cinema History!

 Buster Keaton at his Finest

 Comedy And Stunts And A Great Stone Face

 Nothing like watching the master at work.

 Supreme Silent Adventure and Comic Achievement

 Stone-face Keaton - generally great

 The definitive version remains the Thames Silents version

 A terrific film. So enjoyable it's hard to take one's eyes off it.

 Buster's Best
