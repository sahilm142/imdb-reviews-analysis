 V for Vacuous

 Some movies are arguably overrated, but this is just pathetic...

 An image of Britain in the near future - as envisaged by student activists

 Alan Moore was right to remove his name from this film.

 Total and utter dross

 Cute rip-off Orwell's 1984, but seriously, come on now. In the top 250 movies ever made? Excuse me as I laugh.

 Utterly dreadful

 Yet another portion of political propaganda

 What a truly awful mess of a film. If this got made, it gives us all hope...

 A perverse adaptation of the original graphic novel

 I don't understand why people liked this film

 Very Ridiculous

 Self-Contradictory Philosophy Leads to Poor Political Argument

 Style without substance

 Ridiculous

 Don't waste your time -- or your $$$!!

 Disappointing

 It's Official

 Boring...

 Not a film, a political propaganda piece

 Utter tripe, thanks to Natalie Portman

 Look

 From Strangelove to Vendetta: The journey from Lincoln/Douglas to Sharpton/Kucinic.

 V for Vendetta is so political correct it hurts my bum.

 Quite a dreadful film.
