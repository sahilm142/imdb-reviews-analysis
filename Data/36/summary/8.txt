 Once Upon A Time...There Were Westerns!

 such a haunting theme

 Hey, it's slow on purpose. Is that a good thing? When it's this gorgeous, yes.

 Long, Thoughtful, and Beautiful

 Putting together good literary content and entertainment

 The Last Western

 The classic Western it sets out to be

 Before you have a stroke, please read WHY I was not entirely impressed by this film (then, you can hate me)

 another classic of the Sergio Leone westerns.

 Operatic, to say the least

 The harmonica player

 Thirsty work

 Contester for the best Spaghetti Western?

 Great acting/directing, boring at times

 Slow, but stylish and witty

 Good Western, if you are into that

 Groundbreaking, riveting, exquisite.

 Leone's best?

 The King of Westerns !

 Good movie, but way too long...Ugh.

 There are only two elegiac films that are worthy of their titles; No Country for Old Men, and this operatic epic Spaghetti Western!

 Another masterpiece...

 The formation of the modern western

 A Long Art Western

 Overall, a pretty bad ass epic.
