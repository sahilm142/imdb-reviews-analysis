 Watanabe You Bastard, You've Done It Again!

 masterpiece

 Best anime i've ever watched hands down

 so underrated

 If you like anime, you should try this one.

 Deep story and a blend of Music And Action Much of what you have come to expect from Shinichiro Watanabe

 enjoyable, but i don't get why everyone is praising it so much

 Funky name, FABULOUS anime!

 Hip Hop hooray for Champloo!

 Anime with a Different Beat

 Style over substance.

 For connaisseurs of anime mainly ... but still a major accomplishment

 Just as good as Cowboy Bebop

 The Bomb

 Amazing anime with wild fights and awesome story.

 As A Jaded Anime Fan, I Must Admit That This Was INCREDIBLE!

 Great!

 A True Classic
