 Can you say, boring?

 The Long, The Boring, And The Ugliest

 Too Long, Too Slow , Just Watchable. Sorry

 Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen

 Dated

 Fantastically Bad

 How did Eastwood ever make it?

 The most overrated film in the western genre.

 Awful

 Funny, Campy, idiotic-one of the worst westerns ever made!

 Overrated Western

 The Good,The Bad,and The Ugly

 cynical gallows humor is fun but too long

 Boring as hell
