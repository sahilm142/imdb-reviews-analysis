In 1925 Tampico, a destitute American, stiffed by his ne'er-do-well employer, wins a small lottery and teams up with an honest co-worker and a wily prospector to pan for gold in the Sierra Madre mountains. Writer-director John Huston, faithfully adapting B. Traven's novel, opens the film with a wry flourish, which peaks with a justified fist-fight in the local bar; the second and third acts are less satisfying, with the arc of Humphrey Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs character oddly (and improbably) turning from humble protagonist to mad-dog killer (without any preparation from the filmmaker). The melodramatic or sympathetic turns of the plot don't match up with the initial 30 minutes, which have a sarcastic or mocking tone, although the film is forceful throughout, well-produced and immensely watchable. Not a commercial success in 1948, "Sierra Madre" now holds a reputation as a classic, mostly due to Walter Huston's juicy, Oscar-winning supporting performance as the razor-sharp old coot. John Huston, father of Walter, also won statues for both his direction and screenplay. *** from ****


                
This film tricked me. Because of the cover and Humphrey Bogart's top billing, I thought this would be a Humphrey Bogart movie, but it's not. Nope. The show really belongs to Walter Huston and Tim Holt. In fact, despite the fact that we spend the most time with Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs through the movie, the real story lies with the latter characters, especially in Holt's Bob Curtain.While I normally wouldn't have a huge problem with movie marketing schemes making a lesser character seem larger, the film actually centers a lot on Bogart's character. The problem with that is that Dobbs isn't a very dynamic character and his character doesn't change because of anything we see in the movie, but rather changes for the sake of the story, clearly marking his character as lesser, whereas Holt's character actually undergoes personal conflict which we get to see.The basic story goes that a couple of Americans in Mexico are down on their luck and have to live by begging from other Americans. But they overhear an old prospector talking about gold in the mountains and get themselves, with the prospector, out searching for the treasure of the Sierra Madre. And where gold is involved, there is suspicion, paranoia and, y'know: drama.The overall direction and the acting are good. It's just that the focus of the film is on a dramatically less interesting character, which I feel makes the film a little weaker. I did enjoy the suspense and the morality situations the characters were put in. But the Dobbs character seemed a little artificial and it's hard to stick with a film when its "main character" is written so one-dimensionally.Still, it's not a bad film, just not what I expected because of all the positive reviews and the way the film is marketed. Good, but not up to the hype. 7/10.


                
John Huston's 1948 treasure-hunt classic stars Humphrey Bogart, as Fred C. Dobbs, a down-and-out wage-worker in Mexico who stakes his meager earnings on a gold-prospecting expedition to the Sierra mountains.He's soon joined by a grizzled old prospector, named Howard ( Walter Huston, the director's father) and a young, no-nonsense partner, Curtin (Tim Holt), and when they strike a rich vein of gold, the movie becomes an observant study of human behavior.At its heart the film is really just a superior morality play and one of the best movie treatments of the corrosiveness of greed. For instance, the film easily contrasts the characters: Huston's character, has been through it all before. Curtin is the more naive of the bunch and Dobbs' grows increasingly paranoid and violent over the length of the film: the way you see his burgeoning madness unravel-are the moments that make this film so great.The film also has one hell of an ironic ending.The performances are another thing that really make this film a real classic. Bogart was playing against type, he was not playing his usual romanticized character and he delivers quite possibly the best performance of his entire career.But, it is Walter Huston, who literally steals the entire film, he is a weathered man, who's seen how gold can turn men into monsters. That laugh of his is a laugh for the ages. And that gig he does when they discover the gold. Brilliant.Another great performance comes from Alphonso Bedoya, as the Mexican bandit leader, with his line of "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges!" Another cool thing about the film, was some of the cameos throughout the film. Robert Blake as a boy selling lottery tickets, Ann Sheridan as a prostitute, and non-other than John Huston himself as the ' man in white', the rich man who Dobbs' keeps pestering for money.
This is an engrossing adventure film from then-still-new-to-the-scene director John Huston, that feels like a "B" movie decked out in art-house trappings. At times, I felt that Huston and company were reaching too far in an attempt to make their film "Important," when really they just should have stuck to entertaining us. It's a film that has been lauded by the critical community as one of the best of all time; I don't know about that, but it has much to recommend it.Walter Huston caps off a long career of terrific performances with his scene-stealing number here as the old, wizened prospector who's seen it all. Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are his companions, both slowly undone by their own greed and the siren song of riches tugging at them both. Bogart gives perhaps the darkest performance he ever gave, with perhaps the exception of "In a Lonely Place," but much of it relies more on film tricks than it does acting. Whenever money lust overcomes Bogie's character, Huston shines high-key light directly into his eyes to give them a crazed glitter. There's terrific atmosphere in this film though; the foggy tropical setting is nearly enough to make you break into a sweat in your own living room.Try not to heap too many expectations on this film based on what you've read about it and its appearance on numerous "best of" lists and just enjoy a good old fashioned adventure yarn.Grade: B+


                
This movie won some prizes in 1948 but I'm surprised Humphrey Bogart hasn't got even a nomination. I'd take the risk of saying that this was Humphrey Bogard's best performance in his life (okay, maybe the best one was in Casablanca). The movie is about how gold can change a poor but winsome man into a thorough-paced rascal. Three homeless guys decide to make money by digging for gold in Sierra Madre. In the beginning they are like brothers, help each-other, they work together hard, fight against the ruthless nature and Mexican bandits. But as the weight of gold is rising they start to suspect each-other stealing the other's share of gold... Recommendation: don't bother that this is a black and white, old movie, watch it!


                
After reading the novel by B. Traven, director John Huston thought that it would make a great film. And he saw his father, Walter Houston, as the perfect lead.He felt for the story, as it reminded him of his days in the Mexican calvary. Luckily, his first picture, The Maltese Falcon, was a success, so he was able to make this movie happen. Originally, the studio had George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, and John Garfield selected for the main three roles.Then World War II - and Houston donating his time to make war effort documentaries - happened. When it was all over, Humphrey Bogart had become Warner Brothers' top dog and he wanted in.This was one of the first Hollywood films to be filmed on location outside the United States. Filming began in the state of Durango and also at Tampico, Mexico, where the only Spanish Bogie learned was "Dos Equis."For their work on the film, John Huston won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, with his father winning Best Supporting Actor.
Fred C. Dobbs (Bogart) and Bob Curtin are bums, getting by on spare change when they're recruited by a labor contractor to help build oil rigs. The man skips on their pay. As they return home, they meet an old prospector named Howard (Walter Huston), who offers platitudes about god prospecting and how to get rich.Between beating up their old boss for money and winning a small lottery, the men have enough to go in together to prospect for some gold in the hills of the Mexican interior.What follows is an exhausting process that tries the men's souls, as they're forced to survive in near-unliveable conditions. However, they start adding up a fortune in gold. But now, Hobbs is gripped in the throes of worry - what if his partners screw him over?Of course, there's no way this ends up happy. Even as Howard is honored by the local village for saving a young boy, Hobbs is shooting their partner and trying to leave with the gold.From mistaking a man trying to earn money for his wife as a killer to facing off with a band of Mexican criminals, the danger is real in every scene in this film. Hobbs is murdered by Gold Hat's gang and his gold dust, worth so much that he'd kill his friends, is tossed into the wind. When the surviving Howard and Curtin realize this, all they can do is laugh.
"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is an overrated and overlong Hollywood classic given real juice by its star performance.Bogart is Fred C. Dobbs, a flea-bitten American scavenger in Mexico, who gets the idea of digging for gold in the mountains. Right from the beginning, we see where it's heading: a morality tale about the destructive power of greed. But Bogart, with his generally impassive face but wild, shining eyes, starts going crazy with paranoia, and his descent into madness is captivating.Too bad the movie keeps getting in his way. A subplot about bandits, who utter the famous misquote about "steenkin' badges", just feels like a distraction, and the movie goes on far too long.
Thus movie grabbed my attention with it's ratings on imdb and Matascore. Unfortunately after I have seen a movie I was deeply disappointed by too much dialog and no suspense, which defines a WESTERN genre, but I have to give them a credit, because picture is looking beutiful and a acting is good. Just it wasn't my expectancy and gust.


                
Okay, I've finally watched THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, and I found it to be one of those tough films to comment on, perhaps due to its very excellent reputation. I found Bogart to be very good in the movie, and I also enjoyed Walter Huston's performance and could see how he earned his award. The earlier scenes of the movie - before the men ventured out on their search for gold - actually impressed me more than the main parts of the film did. The classic moments where Dobbs is asking John Huston for a hand out again and again; bitching at the pesty little kid (Robert Blake!); beating the hell out of his "boss" when he tries to pull a fast one. These were my favorite scenes.Once the trio of buddies is out in the heat, prospecting for their gold, I have to say that while the tension and acting was very good, I just guess I had a hard time both accepting and believing that Bogart could actually go THAT nuts, and wind up turning against his friends like that. Paranoia and greed is one thing, but it just didn't sit right with me for this character of Dobbs - especially after we'd seen what a fair guy he is back when he only took his share of the salary instead of grabbing the whole wad of bills from his beaten "employer" (then again, I'm sure the turnabout was supposed to be the idea). It just didn't ring true for me that he could do what he did to his pal. I understand that it was the desert heat getting the best of him, and especially the gold working its ugly spell as the "root of all evil," but it just hit me as improbable and excessive that things would or could go to THAT much of an extreme. Dobbs became a man possessed, and the effect was often more farcial than it was intense.I think director John Huston turned in a fine piece of cinematic work, and for technicality and acting (more than content) I did like this film enough to give it *** out of ****. I thought Bogart gave a very good performance, albeit one that I didn't really want to see happen to his character and one which I had a hard time swallowing actually could. I wouldn't be against seeing it again and re-evaluating it further, somewhere down the line.


                
Bogart is Freddie Dobbs, an American down on his luck in Mexico in some run of the mill town suffering from the heat and the bad luck of scrapping for a meal.  While getting nearly taken by a contractor, he meets up with Bob Curtin and the 2 overhear a fella named Howard about the classic 'gold in dem there hills'.  Howard is a former prospecter and Dobbs and Curtin decide to ask Howard to take them into the hills and find only enough so they can get by.  However the experienced Howard knows what gold can do to a man, and still takes them up to the Sierra knowing that even the most decent of men can think of the most evil things once gold is discovered.The film is a classic and has some great scenes as Dobb's literally descends into madness.  Howard is a classic character and the heat is certainly oppresive in this film.  However, the film I felt was a little lengthy than it needed to be, but it shows what greed can do perfectly.  Take heart wall street, and make sure you set your limits and try not to carry all those buros down the hill by yourself.  You just might end up with less than you bargained for.Rating 7 out of 10


                
This is a movie with a solid cast and a good story but for an adventure movie it really isn't always being adventurous and entertaining enough. I found this movie quite hard to watch at times, cine not always an awful lot good or interesting was happening and I just never really could get into this movie.It isn't always the best told movie and with its style and pace the movie even comes across as a bit clumsy at times. This is a problem I often have with early John Huston movies. I'm pretty sure of it that the movie would had been a much better one had it been made later during Huston's career, when he had some more experience as a director and storyteller. I also think this is a sort of movie that would had worked out way better had it been done in color. It would had made the adventurous and entertaining aspect of the movie come across much stronger. It now instead is more of a dark movie, almost film-noir style like. Perhaps John Huston was practicing for his next movie "Key Largo", which also got released in the same year as this movie. I absolutely love basically all of Huston's film-noir but problem with him seemed that he tried to do everything as a film-noir, even when the movie was in a totally different genre.But no, of course this movie remains far from an horrible movie. It still has a very fine concept in it, as well as a story that in itself has plenty of layers to it. You can watch and interpret this movie in many different ways, which perhaps also makes multiple viewings essential.It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie, in which the three main characters are the essentials. Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going. They are three totally different characters, which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film. Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt and John Huston's own father Walter Huston play these roles. Both father and son also won an Oscar(s) for their contribution to this movie. Quite an unique thing.Surprisingly enough not as great as expected but it still remains a more than good watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/


                
THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all.But it was.THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich.Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed.THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance.Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene.The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him.If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment.I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B)(This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie. This and other reviews are available on http://everyjohnhustonmovie.blogspot.ca/)
From Oscar and Golden Globe winning director John Huston (The Maltese Falcon, The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), I had heard about this film before I found it in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, probably because of the leading actor, I looked forward to watching it. Basically set in 1925, in the Mexican oil-town of Tampico, two Americans, Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt), have been swindled and are down on their luck looking for work. They meet old prospector Howard (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Walter Huston, John's father) who offers to take them on gold prospecting journey to the remote Sierra Madre mountains, they are able to bankroll the finances required when Dobbs wins a small jackpot in the lottery. Reaching the hinterlands by train, and surviving a bandit attack en route, in the desert, Howard proves himself to be the toughest and most knowledgeable, he is the one to discover the gold they seek. They dig a mine and extract much gold, but greed soon sets in, Dobbs begins to lose both his sanity and trust, lusting for the entire treasure, he is also unreasonably worried one of his partners will try and kill him. James Cody (Bruce Bennett), a fourth American, appears and gets the three debating what to do with a new stranger, rather than give him a share of the gold they have found, the three agree to kill Cody. The three prepare to kill Cody, but then the bandits reappear, pretending to be federal police, there is a tense exchange regarding proof of their authority, then a gunfight ensues, during which Cody is killed, the real federal police show up and chase the bandits away. Howard leaves to help local villagers save the life of a seriously ill little boy, he recovers, but the villagers insist Howard should be honoured, but he leaves his goods with Dobbs and Curtis. The paranoia of Dobbs continues, he and Curtis constantly argue, until one night Dobbs holds Curtis at gunpoint, shoots him, leaves him for dead, and takes all three shares of the gold, however Curtis survives and crawls away. Dobbs almost dies of thirst, until he reaches a waterhole, there he is ambushed by the same bandits they encountered earlier, they kill him, but mistakenly they believe the bags of gold are nothing but sand, the scatter the gold to the winds. While Curtis is discovered by the locals and taken to Howard's village to recover, the bandits try to sell Dobbs' donkey, a child recognises the animal, and Dobbs' clothes, reporting them to the police, they are captured, forced to dig their own graves and executed. Curtin and Howard miss witnessing the bandits' execution by moments, and they learn the gold is gone, they find the empty bags and realise that the wind carried the gold away. Curtis and Howard accept the loss with calmness, before Howard laughs that it is a good joke and does a little jig, they part ways, Howard returning to the village to have a permanent home, and Curtis returns to America to find Cody's widow. Also starring Barton MacLane as Pat McCormick, Alfonso Bedoya as Gold Hat, Arturo Soto Rangel as El Presidente, Manuel Dondé as El Jefe, José Torvay as Pablo and Margarito Luna as Pancho. Bogart gives a great performance as the highly paranoid drifter, Walter Huston is also great as the gnarled old man who knows all there is to know about gold, I will be honest and say I drifted off at times, but it is a good story of treasure hunting, John Huston certainly deserved his awards for both writing and directing, and it has fantastic thundering music by Max Steiner, a most worthwhile classic western adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay by John Huston, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Picture (tied with Johnny Belinda). Humpherey Bogart number 36 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Bogart was also number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, "Badges? We ain't got no badges! We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinking badges!" was number 36 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 30 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 67 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies. Very good!
Bogart's career has been overrated from its very beginnings, promoting him into an acclaimed actor much faster than he deserved with some serious role on the silver screen. Such a role finally came with John Huston's <U+0084>The treasure of Sierra Madre", a rough script about the effects of the <U+0084>golden rush" on three typical American thugs. True grit as it is, the story drew the best from the actors, resulting in some memorable scenes and everlasting messages at the very end. <U+0084>The treasure of Sierra Madre" is a serious movie and the most serious role of Bogart's career.
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre", aside from being a great adventure flick, makes for unsettling viewing as we see Humphrey Bogart (having made his name playing tough guys) slowly go insane with paranoia. But the whole movie is like a sick cosmic joke as the three protagonists actually end up finding gold, only to lose it again through avarice, some nasty bandits and just plain lousy luck. It feels like a comment on both the pitfalls of capitalism and the corruptibility of man. It's all well and good until riches come between you and the rest of your crew.But a great trip nonetheless, and a great piece of rugged movie-making.7/10
1st watched 11/17/2013 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-John Huston): Well played drama about a couple of down-and-out American's in Mexico who come upon an older prospector to help them find Gold in the Sierra mountains. Humphrey Bogart plays the more emotionally unstable of the two, and Walter Huston plays the older experienced slightly crazy gold seeker. The theme of the movie is pronounced by Huston's character early on where he says that gold changes men. Bogart's character insists this is foolish talk, but gradually degrades from a man who just wants life to turn around for him -- to a man obsessed with getting as much as he can once they find their gold. Tim Holt plays the third man in the group and fights to keep his conscience clear despite all the temptations. This ensemble piece keeps you interested as you watch the characters react and change as they mine more of the gold dust. It is also an educational movie, because the process of mining is taught by Huston's character to his two younger students in different parts of the movie. The pluses of this movie are the story by the Director John Huston, the characters, the actors, and the simple pacing without a lot of extra un-needed fluff. Today's moviegoers might have a problem with the lack of booming special effects and fast paced action but it isn't needed for this movie. Bogart, in my opinion, was deserved at least an Oscar nomination for this portrayal -- as his feelings are so evident by his facial expressions. Bogart's rough outward appearance and his ability to portray emotions so effortlessly along with his everyday-man appeal made him a famous actor -- but this was not a popular character and he pulls it off perfectly. This is a very well done drama by a much heralded director and it doesn't disappoint and shouldn't age because of how real it comes across.


                
Every now and then I pick up something old to watch from the public library. I hold Chaplin's and Keaton's stuff in high glory, but I've found stuff preceding Clint's "Dollars" - trilogy to be somewhat outdated. "Magnifecent seven", "Dirty dozen" and "Where eagles dare" are still as kick-ass-stuff as "Raiders of the lost ark" to me, but Wayne's "Searchers" and "Rio Bravo", and Bogart's "Maltese falcon" just feel boring and outdated. Even Kurosawa has been so much re-used that it pales in comparison to, say, "Lone wolf and the cub" to me. So I really didn't have high hopes for "Sierra madre". I thought it'd offer some lame action, lines and situations quoted to death, misplaced Chaplin-gags and not much more. However, I was wrong. From the get-go it just took a grip at me and didn't let go until the end. Action is scarce, but the stuff in-between is STRONG. Dialogue, characters and situations make sense and advance the plot in beautiful balance, and a whole lot of stuff happens in Spanish without subtitles so that you STILL follow the plot so that it makes "Die hard" with its 'bits in German' pale in comparison. To sum this up short: if you're not allergic to old-old school action, try it. Definitely. If "Raiders of the lost ark" is "World of warcraft", this is "Nethack".


                
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a story of two young pauper Americans fitting together with an old-timer to prospect for gold in a time on which scattered gangs of bandits terrorize the countryside.The two young guys want to have lots of money while the old-timer thinks it's worth the money and adventure to settle for a peaceful old age period.Before being in search for gold they think "gold" cannot really change their soul or heart but when they really find a small gold mine in the remote Sierra Madre greed and voracity sets in between them especially because of the oversuspicious, wicked, down-trodden loser named Fred C. Dobbs.The more they find gold the more mean he becomes and he starts do become suspicious of his partners he even starts to show indications of losing his mind.It's a nice plot which is superbly acted.Besides if you saw a couple of old movies you would probably notice "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre was one of the first Hollywood films to be shot almost entirely on location outside the U.S., although the night scenes were filmed back in the studio." Based on that I can say it is much easier to produce a movie like "Maltese Falcon" than to create one like Sierra Madre. But I can't help saying I would love to see a Technicolor version of the movie.When the gold is in question black and white doesn't fit in there.You have to use your imagination to presume what you see in black and white is not sand but actually gold.
