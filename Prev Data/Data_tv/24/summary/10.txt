 Extraordinary on so many levels!

 No summary

 While all 3 seasons are good, season 2 stands above

 A Breath Of Fresh Air

 Fargo season 1 is simply the best TV mini series i have ever seen

 Finally a great show after breaking bad and Dexter.

 The first season it's brilliant

 Season 3 is so far the best season

 What if you're right and they're wrong?

 Seasons 1 and 3 are must see

 The King of Crime Thriller

 Outstanding

 Makes me feel uncomfortably ambivalent

 Best Show ever is Fargo
