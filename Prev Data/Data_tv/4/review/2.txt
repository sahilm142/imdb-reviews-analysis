Like lemmings, all of the reviewers seem bent on diving off the "10 star rave review" cliff. Everyone seems to be wowed by the camera work and special effects. They also seem lulled into a pseudo-altruistic delirium thinking that this show is helping to save the planet. Wrong on all counts.A friend of mine once made an interesting observation. He said that there are 2 types of people in the world: (1) those who look at a picture of an old man and see "art", and (2) those who look at a picture of an old man and see the old man. In other words, type (1) people are so enamored of their personal satisfaction and pseudo-intellectual stimulation that they fail to see a picture for what it is.For all you type (2) people, let me just say that this is a bland, vapid and soulless production which probably isn't worth your time. If you're really serious about saving the environment, go out and do it. Don't watch *SIR* David Attenborough's arrogant exhibitionism, thinking in some way that it enhances you as a human being. No, it's just candy for the masses. Sweet, coated, plastic and full of preservatives and synthetic sweeteners.Stop fawning already. Stop the insanity.


                
Film is well made, sure. But I find nothing entertaining about watching big animals kill little animals. And that is half the filming here is. Sorry, not for me.
