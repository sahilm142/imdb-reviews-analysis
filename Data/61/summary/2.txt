 False Legend...

 Lame, Lame, Lame!!!!!!!

 Not the classic I hoped for

 Ugh

 An overrated travesty of a great novel

 A hilariously poor attempt at horror that's unfaithful to the original book.

 Weird People in a Weird House.

 This film is terrible and overrated because it's "Kubrick!"...

 As a Stephen King fan, I was so disappointed in this movie. They changed too much.

 Confusing And Disappointing

 Not as good as everyone makes out

 Don't watch it after you've read the book

 not so much horror as annoyance

 Kubrick is disloyal to the book, and it shows.

 S10 Review's The Shining (1980)

 WOW, HORRIBLE!!!

 Absolutely horrible - Don't waste time!

 Way Less Scary Than You Would Think

 A masterpiece at that time, an ordinary movie at the moment
