 Not as good as they want you to think...

 boring, empty, childish, ...

 More of the same

 More great images - more clumsy storytelling

 I'll review all three at once...

 Overrated...

 Not as good as it is presented to be

 Slow!!!

 Lord of the Borings

 Boring, confusing, and highly overrated

 A too long travel to a too short battle

 Very disappointing

 Terrible (Spoilers)

 Terrible (spoilers)

 If you're not a fan, this won't change your mind

 A Disappointment

 Great Gollum, but the rest of the film was weak

 Great movie, but it has some flaws...

 3 stars: 2 for Gollum 1 for Eiowyn (almost subtracted points for what they did to Faramir).

 A disappointment

 Lord of the 'not all that good'

 I don't know what book Peter Jackson was reading, but it wasn't Tolkiens 'The Two Towers'!

 Biggest Downer Ever

 Words cannot express the joy I felt...

 Jacked Up
