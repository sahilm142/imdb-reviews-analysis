What's the main charm of this anime is that it doesn't take it's hero seriously. Actually, he's an average guy who turned himself into a seriously strong super hero, though no one recognise him as such. He's in fact kind of an idiot, in a good way, and his easy going way of life kind of makes him likable and, most importantly, funny. He acts not as a super hero, but just like a real person. Now the story is okay, with many action scenes, just enough blood scenes and with interesting plot. The bad guys are not many as to confuse, but they are enough. However, somehow towards the end it kind of gets tiring. But, overall, a very funny anime packed with action.
One Punch Man is a silly, straightforward and repetitive anime, but at the same time, it's different, funny, engaging and the most important thing: you can't stop watching the next episode. In fact, I had to restrain myself from watching one episode after the other. I just watched the first season and the OVAs and now I'm really looking forward to see more. Loved it.


                
Well this anime is definitely for childs.Its not like i don't like this anime i loved it but the amount of fame this anime achieved is really not worth the watch.If u like an anime where villains just appear out of nowhere and they get killed without puttin up much fight,u can watch this.If u r looking for an anime just for entertainment without any logic and a main plot u can watch this anime.The biggest mistake for me is that there is no main plot in this anime its just that villains will keep coming and the main character will keep killing them. I liked this anime because of its comedy and i think most people liked it coz of the same reason...A bald guy who is hero for fun....Don't waste ur time if u r really into animes like me...I've watched so many animes like naruto,bleach,AOT,fullmetal,hxh,magi,one piece....nd this anime is no where near with them at all.... A Disappointment....
