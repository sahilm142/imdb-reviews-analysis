 when dreams and nightmares collide...

 A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky/Selby; it's the best DARE movie never made (or would be made)

 A look into the ugly, true world of addiction

 One of the best sad movies ever!

 The power of this film astounds me; a must see!

 Best of it's Kind

 Devastating, grotesque masterpiece
