 3rd and most famous film version

 Birth of a Genre

 Great writing and acting

 Good, but a Masterpiece it is not.

 Spade, a man with six senses

 Our Private Conversations Have Not Been Such That I Am Anxious To Continue Them

 The best noir ever?

 Bogart Tour-De-Force

 For current audiences the big entrance of 'knockout' Mary Astor is a real letdown

 mildly satisfying

 Good acting, tired story.

 The First Film-Noir !!!

 When I slap you, you'll take it and like it

 The mystery behind the Maltese Falcon...

 Overall interesting but the story has flaws.

 Exciting to say the least

 The stuff that dreams are made of

 you wont be disappointed!

 The lost bird...

 Good but not as great as many believe

 Not my cup of tea

 Pretty good film, but too much talk

 "You Got Your Dingus!"

 The Maltese Falcon Review
