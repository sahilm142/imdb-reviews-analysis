 Making a Murderer

 Good, Compelling Reality TV

 Sets the bar

 Mixed

 Look into the void, and the void will look back into you

 A story with an early reveal and a pronounced drag

 Did not enjoy it that much

 Innocent or Guilty???

 Psychopath in details, guilty as charged

 Interesting but biased
