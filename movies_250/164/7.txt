Well this movie was very good for a remake usually remakes are way to different from the original and they make it more violent well this movie did do that but it follows the novel more the violence in this movie is very graphic and quite sickening but its a effective movie its john carpenter was a big fan of the movie because he used clips of it in one of his halloween movies. This movie did follow the original but it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.


                
Nice and estimable action/thriller well directed by John Carpenter who provides a punchy suspenseful Sci-Fi . It deals with a lonely group (Charles Hallahan , Donald Moffat , Wilford Brimley ,Richard Dysart , Richard Masur, T.K. Carter, David Clennon) of scientists who discover weird events , as when the research bunch are menaced by a shape-changing . Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty. It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien from outer space is unearthed by a crew of international scientists. The shape-shifting creature, accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being. It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman. In the thriller The Thing, paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they're infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet. But it is about to wake up. When an alien frees from its frozen prison, the protagonist ( Kurt Russell ) must avoid it from killing them off one at a time. And in this vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish.One of the great Sci-Fi classics , the gradual built-up suspense is quite superb as when the monster is shown largely to create a real menace , though some moments looks and feels just like a remake of ¨Alien¨. This exciting film packs chills , thrills , guessing , paranoia , absence of all characterisation ,spectacular FX , including a loathing chest-burning scene . It takes a liberal stand in exposing the tension of men when confronted with an alien . Based on the novel by John Campbell , the screen-writer Bill Lancaster rejects out the hand the idea that the alien might be worth attempting to understand or communicate with research team . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by the maestro Ennio Morricone . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Dean Cundey . ¨The thing¨ produced by Larry Franco emerges as distinctly Carpenter movie and one might be recommending for its FX , masterfully made by Rob Bottin . B-Film or not , though it's still a masterpiece . The earlier first version results to be ¨The Thing from another world¨ by Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks with Kenneth Tobey , Margaret Sheridan and James Arness as the monster ; it holds a subtle but efficient intrigue . The modern version is The Thing (2011) by Mattijs Heijmingen with Eic Olsen , Ulrich Thomsen , it serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name in which a Paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime. Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago.


                
This intense sci-fi film is almost horror in nature, a la "Alien" as it features a tremendous amount of suspense. If you liked "Alien," you'll like this, the main difference of the two films being the different setting and a different cast.The cast may be different but the characters are the same: scientists-heroes who are all profane low-life-types who you would never see in professions and positions like this. Only in the world of film do you see sleazy people like this in high-tech intelligent positions such as astronauts or scientists. Who better to exemplify this in the 1980s than self-proclaimed macho man Kurt Russell?Back to the positives: besides the great suspense, the story is an involving one that hooks you in fairly early and never lets go. I have a widescreen VHS copy which looks nice, too, since the visuals definitely warranted a widescreen viewing experience.


                
The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well. The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.


                
A very good thriller; gory but effective. The atmosphere of creepy revulsion and panic is conveyed very well.To me, the best line in the movie is delivered by Donald Moffat (as Garry), at the conclusion of the "blood test": "I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F***ING COUCH" A line delivered beautifully by the beleaguered and terrified character.Kurt Russell is good, however the "rebel without a clue" bit may be a little overdone (ditch the yosemite sam hat already...) Well-acted and terrifying, an effective movie.


                
RELEASED IN 1982 and directed by John Carter, "The Thing" stars Kurt Russell as the helicopter pilot of an eleven-man crew at a research station in Antarctica who encounter a ghastly shape-shifting alien that perfectly replicates the appearance of its victims.This is basically a sequel to the 1956 film and even includes footage from that classic sci-fi/horror. The creature is unconventional to say the least and this adds an eerie component to an already otherworldly and confined Antarctic setting.There are no females and therefore no romantic complications. The characters are thin so the story focuses on the thing and how the crew tries to track it down and eliminate it, if they can. The nature of the gruesome entity, how it functions and how it can or cannot be killed leaves you with a lot of questions. The ending is haunting."The Thing" may not be as great as gushing devotees insist, but it's solid sci-fi/horror with some pretty horrific scenes, although only one really creeped me out (the blood scene) while another made me bust out laughing (the torso jaws).THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot in Alaska & British Columbia. WRITER: Bill Lancaster. MISC. CAST: Keith David (Childs), Wilford Brimley (Blair), T.K. Carter (Nauls), Richard Masur (Clark), Thomas G. Waites (Windows), Donald Moffat (Garry), etc.GRADE: B


                
I just finished watching John Carpenter's "The Thing" for at least the 25th time. I've been a huge fan of the flick since the mid 80s (I had a mad teenage crush on Kurt Russell at the time, thanks to "Escape from New York"), and I considered the John Carpenter / Kurt Russell association to be a winning one.I'm not shocked or horrified by the gore anymore, but that's only because I've seen it so many times. The gore is totally believable, and slightly understated (considering the subject matter), and there is no end to my amazement that it's just as good - if not better - than the cookie-cutter CGI horror flicks that have been released more recently. This movie holds up to anything recent in the genre, and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.Russell does a great job (as he always does, regardless of the Grizzly Adams impression in this one), Keith David (I'm a big fan of his voice work) is outstanding...Wilford Brimley was a bit of an odd choice for this flick, even though he does do a good job. You think of the Quaker Oats / Diabetes Test Equipment guy playing that sort of role...it's a bit of a head-scratcher.My point, I guess, is this: I've seen this movie many, many times, and it still holds my attention. No sexual tension, no political intrigue...just a bunch of guys playing with flame throwers and bad-tempered aliens. And the ending is phenomenal!!!!!! The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is because there are obviously many movies out there that ARE perfect 10s, such as: Hitchcock's Rebecca, the LOTR trilogy, American History X and the Shawshank Redemption. But John Carpenter's the Thing is definitely high on my horror list! Though it isn't my perfect 10, I still give it 2 thumbs up from my thumb and my other thumb. There you have it. Enjoy.


                
It was about time I watched this movie again. I was 12 when I first saw it and it scared the living hell out of me. Ever since then I'm careful when I see a Hushky...John Carpenter's version of the "Who Goes There" story is fascinating, scary and pretty gore at several times but it surely is highly recommended. The creepy atmosphere is unique and very few movies equal to it or even come close. The Thing is some sort of Alien monster that has been safely frozen for the last 100.000 years but now it has thawed. That's the fault of a few Norwegian guys...In the form of a innocent looking dog, the thing ends up in an American Station. This is the greatest power of the enemy. It's fully capable to take over any life form and therefore it's hard to detect. And ... even more importantly ... it doesn't take long before anyone can be trusted. Everyone could in fact be "The Thing" This rather simple - but at the same time original and innovative - aspect about the enemy allows the story to create a unique claustrophobic atmosphere. First of all, you have the isolated landscape of the Antarctic Circle. The groups ' space to run and hide is very limited since it's unbearably cold and there are lots of storms. Secondly, the Thing to itself is very unpredictable. The tension between the characters can almost be smelled by the viewer and I think that's Carpenter biggest achievement about this movie. Although, there ain't much dialog in this film , you're kept close to the screen in order not to miss anything. Basically, Carpenter does pretty much the same as in his other horror classic Halloween. Although this is a complete different plot and complete different setting, there's not a message to detect, no psychological undertone or no form of humanity what so ever. Just a raw battle to survive between a bunch of tough men.And last but certainly not least ... some credit for the special effects and make-up department. This crew is just brilliant and pretty explicit for the 80's if you ask me. They managed to visualize a perfectly scary looking creature. Several shocking scenes will haunt your head long after you've seen this movie. Don't matter if you're a hardened horror fan already or not, but the images of a splitting dog and a human head marching on spider legs won't leave you senseless. Excellent Class A horror. Also worth a mention: the subtle but memorable score by Ennio Morricone... Highly recommend to all film-fans, a must see for horror freaks. The original version from 1951 is highly recommended as well. Lovely 50's SciFi-movie, that is !!Favorite "rewind"-scene : The Doctor desperately tries to save a crew-member and prepares himself to give him a heart-massage. At the moment that his hands touch the guy's chest, it splits open and grabs the doctor with filthy looking teeth ...Enjoy !!
Having just rewatched Howard Hawks' The Thing from Another World, I finally decided to see John Carpenter's The Thing on the HD DVD my dad ordered months ago. In this version, the title alien starts to inhabit many of the dogs and people that are stationed in the Antarctic Circle. Among the crew: R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), Nauls (T. K. Carter), Dr. Blair (A. Wilford Brimley without his familiar mustache and glasses), Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan), Garry (Donald Moffat), Clark (Richard Masur), Dr. Cooper (Richard Dysart), and others. I'll stop there and just say how fascinatingly weird and gory this movie is. I mean from the dog scene to yet another creature-coming-out-of-someone's-body sequence, there's plenty of entertaining blood-drenched visual effects courtesy of Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. And the pulsating score of Ennio Morricone is positively riveting. I can't always make sense of the dialogue in Bill Lancaster's screenplay but as long as those monster effects come on, I'm never bored. So on that note, I highly recommend John Carpenter's The Thing.


                
This suspenseful picture horror is a landmark achievement in practical effects and most of its gooey, grisly and generally gruesome creations still stand up today, finding a perfect mix between straight-up gore and the uncannily surreal. Its precisely because these disturbing images are not used as crutches for the taut, tense and ominous narrative that 'The Thing (1982)' holds up to scrutiny and remains such a foreboding and thrilling watch all these years later. The flick keeps you on your toes because its underlying premise means that anyone could be the eponymous 'Thing' from another world. Carpenter wisely never reveals exactly who the creature is until its too late. It really is a piece with brains as well as brawn, one that doesn't mind taking its time and earning its eventual shocks. Its brilliantly ambiguous but low-key ending deserves to be as debated as it is. 7/10


                
Turning Antarctica into fire and brimstone, John Carpenter's analog-era paranoia horror classic THE THING boosts a smorgasbord of eye-popping special make-up effects predominantly fashioned by a 21-year-old Rob Bottin, these human-things, dog-things, assimilated by an unknown, amorphous alien life form, aka, the thing, are gooey, gross-out but also drolly camp without a sinister layer of menace, the truth is, once the thing reveals its true color out of its host's body, most of the time, it is too maladroit to escape from being incinerated by flamethrowers, so the imperative for it is to hide in plain sight among its human hosts, a group of a dozen (male exclusive) American researchers stationed in their secluded antarctic base, and waits for rescue team to make it pandemic. Once audience inures to its animatronic gimmicks, the movie's scary quotient begins to lessen (save for Morricone's minimal, ominous score) and what Carpenter plays up is the burgeoning distrust among those Yankees under the bleak, claustrophobic circumstances, yet, character-molding is not right up his alley (Ridley Scott's ALIEN 1979 is a far superior antecedent), ergo THE THING is considerably deficient in ammunition of imploding conflict and treachery, and high on explosive ruckus after survivors are routinely rubbed out by ringing the changes of optical spectacles, no one is safe apart from the top billed Kurt Russell, as the helicopter pilot MacReady, who is granted with a protagonist's halo and inexplicably brainy enough to float the idea of testing remaining crew's blood to identify who has been infected, on account of the thing's innate survival instinct. However, there is a loose end in the extrapolation that MacReady has been assimilated on the ground of his torn clothes, which goes unsolved. THE THING is Carpenter's foray into studio filmmaking and it relishes in its dazzling production value, its refrigerated setting in L.A. is a huge project and the matte painting of the place where the alien life first crashed on earth significantly enhances its filmic quality, although ineluctably, an analog proto-computer is a dead giveaway of its time and superficially deployed in spoon-feeding us with information such as how fast an apocalypse is at stake if the thing gets out of the station alive. Lastly, Carpenter discloses his ace in the hole in the end, when two survivors seem to calmly wait for their slow death from cold in the now blown-up site, an ambiguous gesture may or may not intimate that one of them is infected by the thing, which beckons various theories from cult followers after its initial tepid reception, in hindsight, THE THING, a seminal gore-fest that beckons a glut of imitations in the years to come, is arguably Carpenter's best.


                
John Carpenter's The Thing was released in 1982 to initial negative reviews from critics and audiences alike but over the years people now understand this film has led to new alien sci fi movies that have proved to be successful because 1982s The Thing started it. The film's intensity and suspense will keep the viewer hooked on the film. The practical effects for the time were great as over time CGI took over but before CGI John Carpenter proved that practical effects can work for a budget of 10 million dollars. From the success from 1978's Halloween John Carpenter was able to make 1980s The Fog, 1981;s Escape from New York, and of course The Thing. You know what all these movies have in common they're all movie classics. John Carpenter's careful direction and patience led to a masterpiece, as so did as six years later another John Carpenter classic was released, 1988's They Live. But none the less The Thing's lead actor Kurt Russell is a classic boss and not a cliché. The film's ending will keep you guessing what just happened but you'll understand the ending after you watch it. Nonetheless this movie is an all time classic and I urge anyone to watch it if they have not seen it.
«The Thing», undoubtedly, is not a boring film. Actors coped with their roles brilliantly and transited a heroes' hysteria that keeps the audience in suspense throughout the film. Right to the end you try to guess who became «The Thing» and who have saved the human qualities. Besides, stunning special effects create a sense that the monsters will come out of the screen. I sure, the main idea of the film is about how simply people can leave their friends for saving their own skin. But there is a thing that disappointed me: lack of a good soundtrack. I need something more then only couple of two terrifying melodies which we can hear in almost every horror film. All in all, film «The Thing» is not bad  in my opinion, it will be interesting for those who prefer to pull the nerves.


                
Carpenter is one of a king when it comes to movies, he does his thing here with some well done directing that really grabs to your back and hangs on, the silent scenes of the long halls only supported by gothic and mysterious music are definetely the best side of this movie, silence can scare.The movie follows a group stationed at a research facility in the antharctica (Spelled correctly? Probably not :), one day two men arrives in a helicopter apparently hunting a dog, they appear crazy and are shooting at the dog without thinking, after hitting one of the men of the facility they shoot the strangers. After going through the information gained from their corpses they travel to their camp and discovers it more or less ruin and burned out, returning to their home they put the strange dog into the kennel where it kills the other dogs and turns out as a monster, an investigation is set upon and the dead dog is investigated, it shows that the dog was controlled by an organism able to imitate other organisms to create a perfect copy, from here, the movie begins.Carpenter showed with Halloween already that his is one hell of a horror director, his strength is that he goes for psychological horror mixes only by a little gore, i hate the gore part of horror movies as it often appears un interesting and in the long run just plain boring, but Carpenter does this differently, he doesn't show to much of it, but still a little to disgust us, his unique style, that has however been copied a few times, is shown very pure here, with the many silent runs through the slim corridors, down creepy halls, with the classic horror music pumping through your vanes.The acting is pretty good, i wouldn't say that there are any of these that does a terrific job, i didn't feel that way at least, there are many main characters, which makes it a little confusing and also hard for one individual to stand out, even if Kurt Russell has the main part, they're all a bit above average but all fades a little to the background as there are so many different persons to focus at.Even though this is without a doubt one of the classic and memorable psychological terror movies, there is no doubt that it is flawed as well as beautiful, there are several loose ends and just generally things that i felt could have been explained better, in the start of the movie it paces very fast through the start of the movie, where i would have preferred a slower introduction that explained better what was really going on, but later on the story sums up rather nicely and does create a rather thrilling and entertaining movie.7/10


                
**definite spoilers**Next to "Halloween," "The Thing" is perhaps John Carpenter's best film. Although it was a critical and commercial flop when first released, it has since gained its own cult following--not as large as the former, but large enough to convince horror fans to reevaluate it. Set near the South Pole, the film concerns a deadly space creature that infiltrates a scientific outpost. This being can absorb any living organism and duplicate its characteristics with chilling precision. If left unchecked, it may wipe out the human race. After a good twenty years, it still holds up for the most part. It is a simply-plotted but well-crafted effort, generating an eerie, desolate atmosphere, not unlike that of Ridley Scott's influential "Alien." Filmed in Alaska, the bleak cinematography makes it seem like it really was filmed in Antarctica. There is an acute feeling of isolation, the sense that we are thousands of miles away from any other human being. It is just them...and it."The Thing" is a more explicitly violent film than "Halloween," but delivers just as much in terms of good, honest shocks. There are moments that still compel the viewer to jump, moments that are genuinely creepy. The special effects work used to bring the alien to life are still very good--nice and gooey, and the fact that the creature makes its presence known when we least expect it only adds to the terror. Inevitably, it attempts to infiltrate this unfortunate group of people. The screenplay cleverly second-guesses the audience's attempts to devise the identity of the creature. Just when we think we've guessed who it is, the film surprises us. The paranoia and claustrophobia is nearly unbearable at times. The creepy music adds more to the atmosphere.In some ways, this is arguably a better film than "Halloween;" Carpenter's pacing is more assured, and the shocks more intense. Yet, the characterizations prove to be the film's major weakness. Aside from Kurt Russell, most of the characters tend to be fairly interchangeable, unfortunately hampering the effectiveness of the material to some degree. It's still a well-made thriller that is obligory viewing for genre fans. I will not compare it to the 1951 original, unseen by myself. The remake is good enough to stand on its own merits, and many have argued that it is actually a superior film. Whatever its flaws, it delivers.*** (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures
This was a very interesting movie.  The movie had a lot of great moments and also it got really enthralling.  The thing was really well done (for the time that they actually filmed this) and pretty disgusting if you ask me, but I guess that was the look that the directors wanted, something that could be almost unbearable to see.  The monsters seem to come out of some other movies like Alien but it wasn't the same thing.  The only thing that the movie could have done better was the performance of Russell, I don't think he is a bad actor, I just thought that the character that he portrait did have a resemblance to the character that he played on <U+0091>Escape From New York and L.A.' and so on, but that was the only fault that I found.  The film it's different and unique and worth the time of anybody, except those people that like scary gory movies :).


                
John Carpenter drops us into the center of a claustrophobic, icy military camp, then unchains a horrific extraterrestrial beast.  Long on gore, the film nonetheless manages to raises the goose-flesh in a more subtle manner: We never know who the monster is.  I know... it's an old musty device.  But it works.


                
First time round, in 1982, this was a scary movie. Having seen it again, recently, it's not as scary as, say, Hallloween (1978), Alien (1979) and others. More importantly, nearly thirty years later, it's now much easier for me to spot the shortcomings of the narrative.But, I'll ignore those so as not to spoil the story which I first saw in the 1951 version (largely produced by Howard Hawks). For its time, that also was a scary movie (for a ten year old) which also served as a political metaphor about the dangers of the Soviet Union and communism. This 1982 version, however, avoids that trap by eliminating all of the military aspects so prevalent in the earlier version.Essentially, the story follows the book written by John Campbell quite well (unlike the 1951 production), showing how a particularly vicious alien attempts to take over and literally absorb  into itself  the scientists and support personnel at an American Antarctic base station. In a series of graphically violent situations, we see how the alien infiltrates and, when finding one of the humans alone, attacks, envelops and eventually takes on the physical appearance of its victims.Hence, creeping paranoia and mutual distrust invade the humans. And, very cleverly, the script and direction make sure that, as viewers, we can never be entirely certain about the true identity of each character as the story reaches its inevitable conclusion  and, by implication, beyond.The special alien effects are still worthy of special mention, particularly as it was all done without any help from CGI. The early scene in the dog pen, when we first see the nasty beast, can never be forgotten, I think; the destroyed Norwegian base camp is suitably spooky and scary; and the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) conducts his own blood tests to weed out the good humans from the bad ones is a tour de force in suspense. Added to all of that is Ennio Morricone's brooding, throbbing, menacing sound track  pervasively shadowing the action, its beat emphasizing the time ticking away as the desperate men battle each other and the alien.Arguably, this is equally a movie about terror as much as horror: the terror of the malevolent unknown, and the horror of one's fellow man taking on the guise of that malevolence. To cap it all, there is no escape, even for the survivors  who may or may not be human anyway. Make your own assessment if you see this movie from John Carpenter, one of the true masters of terror and horror.Recommended for all lovers of sci-fi who like to be scared witless.


                
John Carpenter's "The Thing" serves up not only a civilizational clash between aliens and mankind, but between Hollywood popcorn cinema and the cinema verite and neorealist movements of 1960s Europe. Such an odd blend resulted in many excellent horror films in the 1970s and early 80s, which mixed fantasy plots and big budget SFX with gritty realism and grungy characters.The film  a loose remake of Howard Hawks' equally great "The Thing From Another World" - revolves around a group of men trapped in an ice station during a blizzard. To make matters worse, a shape shifting alien is hidden among them. Much paranoia, tension and violence ensues.Carpenter's special effects range from excellent to hokey, and he does dwell on them a bit too much, but his cast  especially Kurt Russell in the lead  are what really keeps us riveted.8/10  Like "Alien", this is essentially a peek-a-boo haunted house movie, Ridley Scott's lavish environments replaced with better characters, dialogue and arguably more tension. Like most films which rely on easy spooks, the film is a bit too shallow and schematic. Worth two viewings.
John Carpenter really did manage to create something unique with this movie. And throughout the many years, this movie has proved again and again that it is more than capable of withstanding the test of time,And while the special effects certainly show their age, they are actually still good when taking into consideration the time in which the movie was made."The Thing" is driven by a good storyline, although it seems to have suffered somewhat at the cutting board and certain scenes seem to have been artificially reduced to save time.The movie could have benefitted so well from an extended version release. I am not familiar with any done, but of course there might just be such. They have just eluded my attention.The cast in Carpenter's "The Thing" from 1982 was good, and they each brought something unique to the movie."The Thing" is a classic by all means, and if you haven't already seen this movie then it is about due time to do so. Especially so if you enjoy a good Lovecraftian inspired horror movie, because this is definitely tainted, pardon my French, by his unique style of cosmic dread.


                
------------- MY RATING: 68/100 -------------*CONTAINS SPOILERS!*"The Thing" is another classic horror film from the 80s. Unfortunately, it seems I am the only one who struggles with the 80s sci-fi movies...The plot is indeed an innovative one, an alien life form crashed on Earth 100.000 years ago is being discovered and revived by a Nordic research team in Antarctic. The alien functions on the cellular level with unknown original appearance and infects any life form and absorbs it to create a mutated combination of anything it absorbed so far and all that on multiple hosts. Being smart and adaptive, it can take one form at a time to imitate an ordinary organism and it seems it can even absorb memories and habits to adapt even further when it has taken a intelligent life form (ex. a human). The American research team will soon find out that the crazy Norwegian who chased for miles a dog wasn't that crazy and will have to come up with their own plan to survive when the discovery of the mutated form hits the plot."The Thing" does a great job scaring you under a confusing and unpredicted predicament. It's visual effects are great and horrifying and the disturbing "fade to black" scenes of the movie are hiding you what you need to know to keep yourself relaxed and "in control" of the plot.However, the movie is seriously hurt by multiple problems. While the plot is great, cinematography is mediocre and writing is clunky, convenient and unrealistic. Some examples:1) When the dog is led to the room with the other dogs we have great lighting. When the dog transforms and while the other dogs are screaming, one of the characters, in almost zero visibility and complete darkness, calmly opens the door only to realize that there is something horrible inside. As they burn the creature for 2 seconds with a flamethrower, the alien dies immediately and without any second thoughts they distinguish the fire and carry it without quarantine measures to examine it. Then, the doctor has a perfect super computer which can run cellular simulations and calculate the probabilities of infection.2) Throughout the movie and until the last minute, while it is more than clear to the dumbest that the creature strikes those who are separated, our characters are conveniently and stupidly separated all the time, making it extra easy for the creature to devour them. After the 7th time, it really gets annoying, massively downgrading the movie and making you build great frustration.3) Initially, the characters are not really surprised with the discovery, making you look more surprised, despite you are located in your safe sofa in the real world.4) While the characters are trying to save themselves individually and seem so selfish for the 3/4 of the movie, they unrealistically offer to burn down the entire complex and freeze to death in the end.5) The scene with the shark-stomach is voted as one of the most hilarious death scenes of all time and the spider head nearly makes its escape without any of the characters realize it, despite that thing was making noise and it was too big to leave unnoticed. And let's forget that it didn't simply run but waited to be killed by the flamethrower (again)!6) While the creature makes a full reveal in the end and was always devouring its victims immediately, it just stares at our protagonist growling, giving him enough time to use a dynamite to blow it up!All and all, the movie is classic with a great, original plot and truly disgusting horror scenes to shake your spine but the film itself will probably leave you more frustrated than scared.
I must say that after seeing the three brilliant and scary interpretations of John W. Campbell's story 'Who Goes There?'  'The Thing from Another World', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 'Alien' - I sat on my couch to watch 'The Thing' with a bit of skepticism. However, as I knew that John Carpenter is a cult director in the horror sphere, I was definitely ready for a good scare, filled with a decent level of blood and gore, and maybe not too much of a genuine story.The first thing that the viewer sees is a spaceship traveling in the galaxy near Earth. Fast- forward a few hundred years: Antarctica, exactly in the middle of nowhere. In the enormous amount of pure-white snow, we observe a helicopter coming in the distance, trying to shoot a dog. But why do they want to catch an innocent creature so badly? That we actually won't find out (yet<U+0085>), as the dog runs towards an American station, and after a chaotic couple of minutes and a few gunshots (and dead Norwegians), it is finally safe in the arms of confused Americans.This is the moment when all the fun starts. It's like a game of cat and mice between the 'thing' (no one knows what it truly is, as it is able to morph and take shape of any organism that is nearby) and all the researches. This insatiable creature is able to thaw out at any moment, killing a person, absorbing him and then imitating in the most perfect manner. Nobody can be trusted anymore. The people become overly suspicious and paranoid. And up until the very last moments there aren't any special ways of finding out who is human and who isn't. Unfortunately, the main drawbacks of the movie are the superficial characterization and highly unreal behavior of all the frightened men. Even though they realize that they are in grave danger, they sometimes act as if their main purpose of being inside the base was to actually get attacked from behind and murdered. What's more, at times it's even hard to grasp how many people are actually dead and it somehow takes some of the fun away. Carpenter didn't put a huge emphasis on the portrayal of his characters; he much rather wanted to astound us with the very realistic special and visual effects, which are actually quite scary and gruesome. I mean, even though there are some terrifying scenes of gore and pure repulsion, they probably won't be too expressive for regular viewers (or will they?), and exciting enough to stimulate the blood lust of all the hardcore horror fans. Great music score by Ennio Morricone only increases the mood and the overwhelming suspense of the story.However, even though it has some minor flaws, it still is a great and thrilling picture, and it stand out from the huge crowd of many dull and muddling horrors that came out in the 1980's. Dare to watch The Thing, and it will certainly satisfy all your bloodiest desires.


                
Kurt Russell stars in John Carpenter's 1982 sci-fi/horror remake of the 1951 film, "The Thing from Another World" and based on the story, "Who Goes There?" A team of Antarctica scientists encounter a shape-shifting alien lifeform. This is set in the winter of 1982 with a team of male scientists and a helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady (Russell) who find a dog and Norwegians that have been infected by a mysterious alien lifeform. They discover that the alien presence has the ability to assimilate human cells and shape-shift. As some of the team members become infected, MacReady and the others begin not trusting each other and try to survive. This is one of Carpenter's best that has amazing special effects by Rob Bottin and Russell is great as usual. I highly recommend this.
The Thing! I just watched this horror movie. It was very good. I liked it even more than Alien. The Thing has more involvement with the characters. It also has a darker atmosphere. There is more paranoia. The Thing also had a perfect ending. This movie is most definitely worth watching. But Beware, it is quite frightening. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 16. I also would only recommend it too people who liked the horror genre. This movie may not be the best movie to turn someone on to horror, as its pretty graphic. The Thing is a great movie for horror fans. (It's a horror classic). The movie's special effects were very good, but a lot of the gory scenes looked rather dated so they weren't really disturbing. The Thing is about a group of scientists at a laboratory base in Antarctica. One day a helicopter crashes near their base. Norwegians were operating it. Soon after they find out they were chasing a dog. They take the dog into a kennel, and keep it there. Soon after they find out the dog has been taken over by some "thing". They kill the dog, which is no longer a dog but has mutated into a giant alien. They research and find out its an alien creature. This creature can disguise itself as anything it wants too. They then realize that there friends with them could be infected with this creature, further increasing their paranoia. They must find out who is infected and destroy them, and then escape from the base.I was very impressed with this movie. It is gripping, memorable and quite a thrill to watch. I would put it in my top 5 favorite horror movies, and I would definitely watch it again.
This is without a doubt one of the best horror films ever made. The storyline is amazing, the fact that an alien space craft crashes into the Antarctic where they are frozen in ice for thousands of years gave it that sense realism.The fact that the film begins with the action from the gunning down of the dog by the Norweigians immediately gave the film edge. Only for the members at the science research plant to investigate their camp finding the remains of that alien attack. The overall features of the alien creature's capabilities gradually emerging made the film that more gripping, only films like that of Alien were able to undertake. What was more appealing was the fact the alien can mimic its host turning the film also into a thriller as well, the blood test scene was legendary. The films ending was also great that it left the members in circumstances that you are unable to predict what happens.What deserves great appraisal is the special effects that were able to be performed, 25 years later and they still look realistic. The only thing that let the film down was that most of the characters remained emotionless and the only character that turned out to go crazy just ended up embarrassing himself. This film will always live up to its expectations, a true masterpiece.
