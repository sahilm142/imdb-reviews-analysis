 A show that grows on you.

 Raw, Emotional Masterpiece

 Rarely does a show come around that is as vital, and honest, and visceral as Six Feet Under.

 Very enjoyable slice of life

 Nothing Brings A Family Together Like Death

 Dark, Comic, Sad, Intense....Powerful and Entertaining

 Best show for girls ever made.

 A superior dark sit-com
