 Definitely NOT for everyone

 "The Zone wants to be respected. Otherwise it will punish."

 Even Heisenberg Would've Loved This Movie!

 An Unknown area, The Zone or The Path to God ?

 Visually stunning, very intelligent

 A tapestry of beauty and sorrow

 Great Art Film

 Unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming

 Welcome to the Zone.

 Strangely compelling

 A somber masterpiece

 No repeat of the brilliance of Solyaris

 An artistic masterpiece

 High-brow science fiction cinema delivers

 Good

 Poetry...? Alchemy...? Or something else?

 Hard to watch but still good movie

 Step Into The Zone...

 Stalker

 The Greatest Philosophical Film Ever!

 Great settings and mood, very nice movie overall

 Atmospheric, weird, intelligent, a little too slow

 The eternal quest for fulfillment

 One-third of a notion

 Stalker Review
