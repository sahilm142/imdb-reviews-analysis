I have tried on no less than three occasions to watch this supposed classic and I have never been able to make it to the cattle drive.My question is which of the characters are we supposed to like and why? When you look close they are all a bunch of jerks. They treat women and minorities like dirt, they think nothing of invading a foreign country to commit capital crimes, they kill innocent bystanders and dismiss it out of hand.This is what our country is built on? The sad part is that too many people have these attitudes to this day. Lonesome Dove is not a testament to a great American past, it is a look at everything that is and was wrong.
