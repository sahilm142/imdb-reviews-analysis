 Adding My Voice to a Loud Chorus

 Style over substance, yet still impressive

 A frame to die for.

 Great atmosphere, visually groundbreaking, little plot, very slow

 Sci-fi/actioner cult classic

 I Don't Like It; I Watch It Anyway

 One of those films that requires a second viewing

 Good visuals don 't make a good movie

 More like Blade Jogger, but still obviously influential

 nice movie but empty ending

 The story and characters are a little thin, but it still contains many strong elements

 Rain, Rain Go Away!

 GOOD BUT...

 Aesthetically powerful, slow philosophical Sci-Fi

 The future is here

 What Does "Blade Runner" Even Mean?

 i can understand

 Blade Runner Review

 Good, but flawed (and dated)

 A Manufactured Humanity

 all hail the director's cut

 Blade Runner

 seems a bit overrated

 Good film but...

 A classic.... but then so is Mary Poppins
