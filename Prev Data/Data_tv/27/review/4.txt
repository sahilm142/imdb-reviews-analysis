The 3 out of ten is because it starts amazing but then goes downhill. In the end it does not work. The story is designed around a set of rules regarding the deathnote notebook but the writers obviously couldn't deal with their own rules and after a few episodes started adding more rules and changing existing rules until I forgot what half of the rules were but even so the story and characters started off amazing. By the time I got to the the episodes in the late teens I was starting to feel it had become silly, disjointed and at times confusing maybe because by this point it had lost my attention. Episode 19 I rewatched 4 times because I was getting bored and kept getting distracted at which point I thought enough is enough and I never watched it again. I can't deny though the good bits are pure brilliance and exceptionally clever. Such a shame it lost direction. Would I recommend this - yes - but without me giving spoilers I will just say when it starts getting silly call it a day and then watch a good anime like Hunter x Hunter.
