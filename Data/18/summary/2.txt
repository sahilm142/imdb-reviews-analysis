 Great Special Effects Do Not Guarantee A Great Movie

 Somewhere up there, Ed Wood is smiling...

 Stop the insanity-This is not a good movie! Where did the script go?

 The Unofficial Sequel to "The Truman Show"?

 A wasted plot...

 The Matrix is pretty good, but overrated.

 PLEASE RETIRE NOW KEANU.

 poor plot, unoriginal quotes, plenty of stereotypes

 Very overrated

 I hate this film

 Very original idea but nothing happens (boooriiiiing)

 Disgrace to the human race

 Terrible

 Tennis without the net

 The beginning of the worst trilogy ever.

 Often hilarious when it's not boring.

 What's the big deal?

 Brilliant or terrible?

 Incredibly appalling!

 Good special effects, but no originality at all.

 Mediocre

 Awful movie

 Too much a movie of today.

 Urgh!

 Market Forces win the day
