 very sooon

 pleasant trite verging on nauseating

 Horribly unrealistic characters

 No redemption for pitiful movie

 A hyped film, for my opinion

 Pretty boring stuff

 Dangerous Simplicity

 One of the Most Overrated Films Ever Made!

 Good but not great

 Triumph of the human spirit

 Are you sure that this movie is the better of every movie in the world?

 Not Really Impressed

 One of my all time favorites !!!!!NOT

 This is a fairy tale....

 The Shawshank Redemption: An Utter Travesty
