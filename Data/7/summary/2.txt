 The hype will die down

 Much weaker than we'd expected or hoped for ...

 A great disappointment - but no surprise

 Yawn Yawn Sell Out

 From part 1 to 3, completely devoid of soul, explanation and rationale

 Could this film take longer to end?

 Please Stop! I'll Talk.

 crap

 Only Orlando Bloom is worth seeing...too many ugly people

 Peter did a bad, bad thing

 I'm going to see one of adventures, or I thought that

 battle scenes saves this movie for getting 1 out of 10

 "Q: Where Would You Rather Be? A: Anywhere But Here..."

 boring

 A Hatchet Job on Tolkien

 The trilogy fizzles out....

 Thank God it's over!

 An Overlong Violent Video Game

 Wagner might do better

 Entended disappointment

 Emotionally vacuous; brutally boring

 One of the most over-rated movies of all time. It drug on FOREVER. End it and hour earlier and i might think it's bearable.

 Truth misleading

 An unbiased view of this movie

 Return of the Turd
