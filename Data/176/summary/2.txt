 Ozu's Quietly Brilliant Masterpiece Deserves Your Attention

 Too subtle and yet too obvious

 A cinema of tears

 The excuses we make to justify our neglect of others

 Extraordinary Portrayal of Real Life

 Universal appeal of Tokyo Story

 "Isn't Life Depressing?"

 beautiful meditation on old age and family; simple and moving

 FANTASTIC

 Things are the way that they are and it is perfect

 Very interesting movie however it needs some patience from the moviegoer

 A meditative masterpiece

 Considered Ozu's masterpiece

 A Movie to Make You Think about Parents' Seniority and Children Indifference and Selfishness

 Stunningly over-rated

 Somehow Not The Best Film Of All-Time One Is Often Led To Believe

 Slowww

 Life is simple and unique. That's very true.

 Honor thy father and thy mother

 Touching story, but something is missing for me...

 Underrated as a result of being apparently overrated

 Great movie

 From the If-It's-Boring-It-Must-Be-A-Masterpiece school of filmmaking

 Not that great.
