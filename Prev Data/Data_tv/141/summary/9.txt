 My 347th Review: ...this is as good as TV gets....

 Simply ... WOW!

 TV's best drama that's compelling and informative it shows the early days of America's Playground as it ran with politics, corruption, greed and power struggle!

 Damn Good Start

 Boardwalk Empire is All Boozed Up ***1/2

 Ambitious, historical, and very impressive story lines and characters

 The Best Crime Dram Series .....Ever

 Prohibition drama roars ahead of all rivals

 A timeless show

 Probably best series ever

 A Good Series, but not peak HBO

 Another great HBO series

 Destined to be a classic

 Exciting,great cast,very twisted

 The Roaring 20's back on Boardwalk Empire

 Real life characters such as Al Capone has the viewer just wanting more

 one little extra goof...

 A nice run over the years - Very well done by HBO

 Great period piece!

 The backgrounds, the music, the costumes, who needs actors?

 Splendid TV show to add to the pantheon of greats

 Amazing Series

 If you liked Sopranos, you're going to love this

 The only thing I hated about this series

 Don't we love criminals On screen
