I've watched all 291 episodes of Z and let me tell you something, its a whole load of fun. The character development in the show really stands out. Take Vegeta and Piccolo for an example. Vegeta went from a villain, to a cold anti hero, to a father and a hero. The action in battles was amazing (The father son KameHameHa was probably my favorite Dragon Vall scene of all time) and the dialogue was great as well. The humor was good (though Z's humor will never compare to the OG Dragon Ball's humor) and every single death was enough to put a lump in my throat, despite knowing that they'll just get revived. Now. lets move on all to Z's negative points. Each Dragon Ball saga follows one main storyline. A new unheard of villain appears, it takes a few battles and transformations until they eventually beat the villain. Some time passes, and a new villain even stronger pops up. Despite the battles being awesome, they were slow as well. The Frieza battle took like 13 episodes and the Saiyan battle took 10 episodes.In the end, Z is fun. It has flaws but overall, its awesome and I recommend it.
