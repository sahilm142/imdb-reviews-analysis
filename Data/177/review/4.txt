For this movie, I have to say, it just isn't my taste. At all. Too trying to be artistic and too dull. Or I just wasn't in a mood for this movie.I can't rate this higher than animated movies with much better graphics. With much better humor. With more emotional power. With better music. etc. Still, I did recognize why people like this movie. It can connect with people experiencing loneliness and struggling to find friends. But even so, the characters aren't too likable. I don't know. I think this just isn't a movie for me. And that is all there is to say about it. I see some people loving some girls I don't find beautiful at all. So, we all have our own tastes. Nothing new here.Why the high rating? I can only assume, only a select audience is viewing this. Real blockbuster audience would rate this 7.0 tops. But I guess this is how it is. And that is why IMDb ratings can't be fully trusted. My Real Rating 3.9
