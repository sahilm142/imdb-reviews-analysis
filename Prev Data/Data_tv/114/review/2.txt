I used to watch spaced while living with an annoying friend who did not like it.I said "its a classic ,it will be well thought of for decades to come."He disagreed one of the reasons was how "NOW" it was . "This will be embarrassing to watch in a few years,"he said.I hate it when other people are right. When you take out the dated pop culture references to the matrix,buffy, resident evil and star wars your not actually left with much.Simon pegg's "acting" in particular is embarrassingly bad. What hasn't aged and still impresses me is the camera direction and the snazzy editing .This must be why Edgar wright went on to better things. This show still shines bright in my memories if not in actual reality any more
