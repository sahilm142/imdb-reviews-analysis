 The problem with Tarantino

 No story to the movie

 idiotic excuse for teenage mentality violence

 not as good as advertised

 it is kill something allright. but it isn't bill

 Trash, absolute trash...pure and simple

 I am stunned

 There was promise, but its just too dirty for me.

 I'll kill myself if I have to sit through this again

 The Tarantino touches were not suited to this movie.

 A huge dissapointment... Best part of the movie was the end when it finished before we thought it would!!

 In one word, awful

 Definitive Proof! -that only the stupid are reproducing.

 bloody boring

 Kill Geek

 Loathsome

 I don't care who directed the movie, it still stunk.

 For pseudo-cineasts and manga-lovers only (1/10)

 Now What?

 Tarantino Can Only Make One Film

 Sergio Leone wannabe

 Hardly a film

 Charlie's Angels on acid: An insult to kung fu movies

 "Kill Bill" is sensless gore

 Asian Cinema's poor bastard son
