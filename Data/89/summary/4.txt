 Ouch! My Hurting Eyes

 Overbaked and overrated

 The Future Is Friendly (For Raping, White-Trash, Sociopaths, That Is)

 Like a punch in the head

 Not Enjoyable at All

 Semi porn trash

 Almost completely unwatchable.

 Talk about over rated

 Garbage

 Disappointed

 I did not like the main character.

 I'm not sure why it's so overrated

 A single idea, buried under surface activity

 Marvelous waste of time

 Got poisoning from this mad descriptions...

 Didn't make me look away!

 I'm not sure weither i like it or hate it.

 9 times outta 10 the book is better than the movie

 It needs winding up!.

 As great as it is, the movie's scenes of blatant depravity detracts what can be gained from viewing it

 What was that?

 Why I don't like it

 Brilliant - but why???

 A Well Directed, Tasteless Snorefest
