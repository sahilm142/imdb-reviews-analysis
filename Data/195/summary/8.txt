 perhaps the blackest black comedy ever

 "What sort of script do you think we can make out of this?"

 Network: A World Gone "Mad As Hell!"

 Every millennial should watch this 1970s classic

 This is the most effective satire film I've ever watched.

 Brilliant and prescient

 A Fierce and Searing Media Satire

 Truth

 Masterful screenplay, terrific performances and so relevant

 A satirical examination of the evil exploits in a television network

 Funny,True,Scarry....and like wine, it becomes better by the day

 Prophetic dark comedy

 Old but incredibly beautiful

 Network

 I'm Mad as hell and Overacting can sometimes help a movie!

 "we deal in illusions man"

 Paddy Chayefsky was right, you've got to stay mad!

 Despite being made almost 40 years ago, this is a scary depiction of today's television...

 More Relevant in the Internet Age

 Wasn't as good as I thought, but still good to watch

 solid

 Strong, although over-the-top, satire

 FOX Network

 Perception shapes reality

 A movie about ratings, and it deserves a high one.
