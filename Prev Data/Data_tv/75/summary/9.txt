 The 2nd installment of Akira Toriyama's iconic anime about the life and adventure of Goku, earth's greatest defender.

 Just one word! AWESOME!!!

 A true classic!

 Amazing, despite the obvious faults

 Dragonball is life itself

 A Must Watch

 More than what some people think it is, equal what to it wants to be

 My Reviews:Dragon Ball Z

 Great Fun......Though it got boring
