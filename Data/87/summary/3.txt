 clever but shallow and pretentious film-school exercise

 Spoiler Warning: This Movie Sucks

 The de(con)st ruction of Charlie Kaufman?

 Shallow film about shallow people aimed at those who believe they are deep.

 Somewhat like Memento.

 They can do better

 Charlie Kaufman, As Usual, Trying Too Hard

 What a great idea, that bad development

 Winslet and Carrey have no chemistry

 Um, great title!

 highly Overrated

 Sleepy

 Trite

 Walked out on this movie

 The best thing about it is the title

 Should be nominated for a Daytime Emmy (spoilers big time)

 I hated it. Boring and repetitive

 One of the few movies that I would've walked out on.

 slow and uninteresting

 One of the worst movies that I have seen in recent years!

 Why would anyone make a movie like this?

 Okay, Maybe, but too hard to follow!

 Groundhog Day meets Ghostbusters?

 I was disappointed
