 Disgusting nonsense...

 Full Metal Fame Jacket...Or something.

 watching teenagers being abused

 Moronic, pointless, and full of crap

 Good Job

 Promoting fascistic perfectionism.

 The Glorification of Bullying in Film and Sanctioned by Hollywood

 Extremely Overrated - all-around horrible

 how to kill a teenager! a new Milgram experiment! Bullying presented as a good thing to motivate a teen! it's criminal

 Critique from a drummer and a human

 Terrible, unrealistic portrayal of a beautiful art form (Jazz)

 100 minutes of torture

 Brutal, unrealistic Hollywood garbage

 If this was a comedy, I would've given it ten stars!

 Psycho Music Teacher

 Sickening

 A film about bullying.

 Fails to understand what it means to be a musician

 Hollywood make-believe garbage at its best.

 Most terrible movie I have seen in years...

 Simplistic, Predictable... Well Acted, Good Music

 This brings the art of music down to the level of sports

 And I laughed and laughed

 A "Music Movie" that manages to get everything about music completely wrong.
