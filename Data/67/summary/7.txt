 A fulfilling end to a legendary trilogy!

 Okay, but major holes in the execution

 Simply slacking off

 "You missed a spot, Nolan"

 Good movie, but worst of the trilogy.

 Cheesy,overcrowded and without much surprise

 Satisfying, it not somewhat of a letdown

 Overly complex, overly long and ultimately underwhelming

 Dark Knight Rises Falls Flat

 The hero Gotham deserves...

 Great, but no TDK

 A great film but definitely not perfect

 The Dark Knight Rises and Falls (NO SPOILERS)

 Overrated

 The weakest film of a great trilogy

 Did he have to sink so low... before he rises?

 On par with Batman Begins - But that's all!

 A Flawed, Disappointing End to the Trilogy

 Falls Short of Previous Entries

 Though it did not quite live up to its predecessor, The Dark Knight, this was certainly an entertaining and well-crafted movie with a good plot twist.

 Liked it more than I thought I would

 Solid. Satisfying. But not spectacular.

 Not Epic, But Yet Impressive!

 too superficial

 good, but Dark Knight expectations proved too high
