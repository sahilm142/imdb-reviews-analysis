 Trek in the 24th Century...

 A new generation well worth exploring

 It does improve a lot after season 2

 Shows an amazing idea of what the future can be.

 Come... Warp 10... Engage... Make it so... The Next Generation

 A "bold" start for a new generation

 Exit the Vulcan. Enter the Shakespearian Captain.

 Almost my fav, still amazing

 This worthy successor ended up surpassing Star Trek TOS

 Star Trek: The Next Generation Review

 Higher star

 Classic Sci-Fi - Subpar Acting/Graphics But Unique Plots

 A great series defining one of Star Trek's best eras

 Great show

 Best Sci-fi, goes back to basics: human curiosity for exploration

 Major improvement over the original series.

 New series set decades after Kirk's mission

 Great Sci-Fi

 Liked series overall but....
