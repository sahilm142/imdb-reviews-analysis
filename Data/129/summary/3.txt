 Pointless

 Deadly Dull, Deadly Stupid

 Does not tell a story

 Barely Okay, But Nowhere Near Great

 Represents the cruel delusions suffered by a young girl in brutal surroundings. CONTAINS SPOILERS**

 Pretentious waste of time

 A shallow gore-fest

 Absolutely unnecessary violence

 fantasy does not live here

 Subtle as a Brick

 Completely Overrated

 Spectacular Fantasy? Not quite, Overrated? Definitely

 Pan's Downfall is its Director.

 All in all, at least it is better than Sin City.

 A fairy tale with actual fairies in it. Harry Potter all over again.

 Not enough fantasy

 I would like my money back, Mr. del Toro

 Two incomplete films

 Not thrilled...

 Garbage

 Overrated and I'll Explain Why

 Wouldn't watch this movie again

 Pan's Sadism

 Most over-rated film of the year

 Nice moments but essentially rubbish
