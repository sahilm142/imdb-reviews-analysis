I had seen the Investigation Discovery documentary which did not have any commentary whatsoever, rather, just the implementation of letting the real-time footage speak for themselves and it was excellent. All crime cases spur me on to read or dig in deeper about them, and this was no exception. This was also the first time I had learned about O.J. Simpson after hearing his name and case in passing for a long period of time. I had heard mentions of O.J. on the Adult TV series, South Park, and really wasn't curious to know much further. I knew he existed, and that was all. But, upon watching the documentary, and various interviews of him, after the case, and the people who were involved, I felt I wanted to know more about the case; educated would be too far-fetched a word, so I'll use the word: "curious". And I came across this T.V. series by FX. I didn't need anybody to tell me to watch it; I immediately did so myself! The first episode is terrific, and that's all I have seen until now, so this review may seem biased, but the overall accumulation of reviews are anyway way on the upwards of 8 so it really wouldn't matter. Being a David Schwimmer fan, and a die- hard John Travolta fan made me want to watch this series even more! Go for it! I'm sure the remaining episodes are going to be as taut and thrilling as the first one!
