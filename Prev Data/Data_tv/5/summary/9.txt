 Brilliant Character Work In Pitch Black Comedy-Drama

 Hello, Mr. Cranston - Meet Ms. Emmy...

 Step aside Tony Montana, cause here comes Walter White.

 This show broke me badly.

 Bryan Cranston at his best

 Excellent! Comedy, like chocolate, can be best when very, very dark.

 Matchless as well as unmatched, stylish in its own right, addictive, experimental, triumphant and novel in every possible way, this is one of the great TV shows of all time.

 Miscommunication , fragile egos , high voltage killings & tricky heists .

 Interesting show

 Gripping, compelling drama/thriller with a dash of black comedy.

 Very good character development and acting, highly recommended

 Wonderful and revelatory entertainment

 A true masterpiece
