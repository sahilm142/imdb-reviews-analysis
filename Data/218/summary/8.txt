 A pathetic excuse for what should've been an epic movie

 A breathtaking finale to an amazing series

 The series ends on a very strong note.

 Ehhhh...

 An emotional roller-coaster and the perfect end to constantly better series

 The End of Harry Potter

 Excellent

 Worthy

 Messed up the end scene, still pretty good

 Harry Potter pulls his wand out for the last time...

 Action packed, genuine heart and emotional drama made this movie, a very engrossing magical epic spectacle. It has everything, a finale should have.

 Snape is the best acted character in Harry Potter franchise and Alan Rickman deserved at least nominations for best supporting actor if not the Oscar itself

 A very god ending

 Compelling

 A fitting finish to the Harry Potter series

 A very worthy farewell

 The final confrontation

 Let's finish what we began

 Good enough.

 Potter for ever

 Overrated on IMDb

 Well done! The only weakness was related to the story itself.

 "You are..., a very unusual wizard."

 A great send off to the popular franchise which ran from 2001 to 2011

 A Story With A Heart But No Structure
