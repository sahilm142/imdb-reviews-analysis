 A Film-Study Exercise

 As of 07 July 08 - this is number #28 of 250? This film should be #1 - but back in the 40's not in the 21st Century.

 Borrrringg

 Great "Art", little else

 In no way is this the Greatest Film Ever

 Overrated..

 They did'nt know how to deliver in those days

 probably the world's most famous and highly-rated film

 Sophomoric gargoyle

 What's with these "weighted averages"

 Citizen Kane - A Flop?

 What the - expletive deleted - was so good about this film?!?!

 Best film in the world? Is it a joke?

 Bored me to tears

 But ... the king HAS no clothes

 Greatest movie ever????????

 Horrible

 So bad we never saw the end

 Outdated, possibly used to be great

 Ugh....
