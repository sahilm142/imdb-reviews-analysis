It's amazing what music can do for a film. It can add intensity, capture emotion, or give a comical vibe. It can also annoy the (insert expletive) out of you, however, and if it is one thing that I have learned from watching The Third Man is that it can ruin a movie.The entire musical score of this movie is a single, borderline-infuriating piece of music (heard it before; don't know what it's called) that is played consistently, and is consistently out of place. It completely ruins the suspense of virtually every scene. It would have been better if they had absolutely no score, at all. It's that bad.This film would have been an 8/10, but the fact that music causes it to fail as a thriller means that I didn't enjoy it like I'm guessing I was intended to. I can't give it more than a 3/10.


                
I must say , after 30 minutes from the beginning , I slept , and I continued watching it the next day just to know , why is this on the top rated movies !? and why this movie won an oscar award ! for what !? for the boring story !? or for the stupid music !? a total waste of time . I warn all of you . skip it !!.


                
I was slightly disappointed with this. I was expecting a bit more
