 Tarantino... I am disappointed

 Django Unchained

 Worst Tarantino film

 What is this movie supposed to be?

 A pretentious and unworthy revenge fantasy by a man who can do so much better

 Tarantino peaked a long time ago.

 Nice story until you realize there is something sick about it.

 one dimensional and unpleasant... terribly overrated

 Uncle Tom's Day of Anger

 Deja Vu?

 Tarantino got it wrong

 Django Unchained wrongfully nominated for academy awards?

 Starts off great, gets boring, self indulgent cleverness, yawn...

 Hope you're reading this, Tarantino...

 Eastwood in shades.

 So Disappointed

 Less than expected.

 Django Unimpressive

 This time, Tarantino's ego is over everything

 Average movie

 Interesting but...

 I am missing the Tarantino in this, I loved in earlier films.

 I was bored by the very slow pacing

 Don't people get bored of always watching the same junk??

 Django uninterested.
