 A movie with a gentle but long-lasting impression.

 Wanna See Dead People?

 Strange but ultimately rewarding

 Shyamalan

 "Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone?"

 I see dead people....

 the ultimate twist ending

 Still a Good Movie Even Though I Knew the Twist

 Even if someone spoiled the ending for you, it's still worth seeing

 Overrated, but good.

 The Sixth Sense An Effective Thriller With A Good Twist Ending

 takes its place among the best thrillers of our time!

 Good movie but spoiled by a plot hole

 chilling, sad and uplifting all in one

 A Twist Like no other

 Not Every Gift Is A Blessing

 The dead speak most eloquently

 Social Problems, Fear and Human Nature

 This seminal horror picture is one of the best in the last twenty years.

 A lush, absorbing film

 Deserves All The Praise!

 enjoyably terrifying and amazing storyline

 i see dead people

 The only Shyamalan movie worth watching

 A rare 'twist' movie that holds up to repeated viewings
