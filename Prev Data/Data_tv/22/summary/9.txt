 Surpasses the original in almost every way

 Just might be the perfect mainstream series

 A Fantastic Reboot

 Addictive, with a good plot, good action and also nice plot twists.

 Mediocre beginning, but fantastic finish

 Don't pass this one up!

 Full Metal Alchemist

 Emotional, Thrilling and Amazing

 In the world of anime/manga, this series stands out as a shining star while remaining faithful to the source material.

 Fullmetal alchemist

 Amazing And Worth The Watch

 An absolute must watch

 Gripping storyline. Highly entertaining.

 Great as I expect . Worth to watch for every second .

 An experience well worth your time and patience

 A beginning, and an ending!

 It was addictive but...

 Watch "Fullmetal Alchemist" (2003) First!

 One of the best steampunk shows, but not THE best

 Awesome show

 7.8/10
