Watched too many mindless comedies this decade. Every time I watch a nonsense comedy(that opens to negative reviews) , I wonder why people make these films. Now I think I got the answer.After watching this film , I realised that Charlie Chaplin was the one who started the culture of nonsense films . But what ever he made has been appreciated by the critics. I am sure if it was directed/acted by anyone else , it would have been forgetten by everyone.  Sets used at the war scene were poor.So was the character portrayal of both Characters of Charlie Chaplin .Every character he plays has to behave like an idiot, even the cruel general . He think being mentally ill and doing silly things is the only way laughte can be brought into a film. There are so many inane scenes like one in which he plays with the globe. There are funny scenes too (actually many ) but most of the others are stupid. The final speech by the Jewish barber is the only positive thing about the film . Otherwise , disastrous film .
Undoubtedly this is not Charles Chaplin's best work. This guy is a legend but sadly his performance in this film was not nowhere near legendary.The story was not well written and lacked quality humor in it. Some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and dull. If the film's run time was one and half hour long then the film would have been more enjoyable.Charles Chaplin's performance was good but it was not his usual excellent work. I think the script failed him badly. Because the story didn't stick to the character all the time, sometimes it went off the character and did something which does not fit the character they build up.All in all it is a good movie but does not deserve this much high ratings.
