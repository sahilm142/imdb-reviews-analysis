 The Dark Knight Rises one last time to save Gotham City...

 Simply Fantastic

 I loved It

 Amazing and Brilliant!!

 The Perfect Ending to the Trilogy

 Good movie but not as awesome as everyone says.

 The surprisingly fitting epic finale!

 the dark knight definitely rises BUT couldn't super-cede the second movie...

 If you've ever laughed or cried or cheered at any projected moving image, you cannot afford to miss this trilogy

 First impressions good

 As a die-hard(however levelheaded) comicbook fan...

 A Slow Kick To The Epic Trilogy

 Not on level of previous ones but entertaining movie

 One of the best Batman films yet

 brilliant story arc

 Absolutely a worthy third film in Nolans batman trilogy!

 A fulfilling end to Nolan's take on the Batman

 Quite an ending..!!!

 Thought provoking and entertaining

 Terrible Film

 Behind the guise there is Bruce Wayne

 The weakest of the trilogy, but still a triumphant ending.

 Good movie but missing something

 The send off of the dark knight.

 A good finale for Nolan Batman trilogy
