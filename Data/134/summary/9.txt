 A kids movie?

 Totoro is a Winner

 A superb, uncynical journey into the imagination. Not so great dubbing, though.

 Introduction to one of the greatest storytellers

 A beautiful work of art for young and old

 Succeeds as an adventure fueled by the innocence and wonder of a little girl.

 No impractical !!

 Definitely a must see

 Honest and very good
