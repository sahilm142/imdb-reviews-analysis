 Italian Storytelling

 Not a bad movie, but not that great either

 Shallow Ultraviolence and Slimy Characters. Overrated Movie

 Jon Monsarrat review: too arty & violent

 Flat, boring, simplistic movie.

 Good movie, but did not live up to the hype

 A despicable movie.

 Nominated for "Best ripoff", or what?

 Classic direction, though schizophrenic.

 Profanity, Violence and sex......

 Still schizo

 Good concept, meh execution

 Boring
