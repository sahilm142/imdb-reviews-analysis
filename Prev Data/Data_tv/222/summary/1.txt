 Who wrote this crap?

 Really?

 It was a Good show, now it's just a show trying to earn ratings by all means

 A sham of a show

 Overacting and beating about the bush at its best

 Human Tragedy

 Suits is dead

 Suits is not even suited to fit a corpse

 Season 8 is the downfall of this series

 Suits Season 8 is more of the same old thing and a letdown

 OMG....so bad

 Apologist Show

 downhill fast

 What a deaster sea8 with Katherine Heigl - no thx -

 Samantha Suck

 This should have been renamed The Walking Suits without Mike Ross.

 Utter crap!

 Horrible in every aspect

 The rating needs to be averaged out

 seriously, what's up y'all?

 Please get Mike Ross back.

 BRING BACK MIKE/Patrick J. Adams

 End it now, it would be a mercy killing.

 Worst legal drama ever

 Flawed from the start.
