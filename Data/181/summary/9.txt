 A time when I thought dinosaurs were real

 Brilliant

 As said, the Definitive blockbuster movie

 Life finds a way...

 Such a classic.

 " Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should "

 Still holds up today!

 A Well Loved Generational Shift Movie

 With a bazillion other reviews, I'll keep this short.

 Hold on to your butts, it's now in 3D. Jurassic Park is Rex!

 Fantastic!

 Dazzling spectacle, with the dinosaurs as the scene-stealers

 Stomping, chomping dinosaur action par excellence.

 But if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the Pirates don't eat the tourists.

 A fantastic film!

 Big summer movies simply do not get better than this

 A great movie...

 The Monster of All Monster Movies!

 A Lot Better Than It Appears To Be

 One of my first movies, still a classic

 Great Movie That Never Gets Old

 Welcome to Jurassic Park

 Clever Girl....

 Horror hits the mainstream!!

 A rare breed of film seldom seen anymore: a true masterpiece.
