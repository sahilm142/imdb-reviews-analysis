Yes, Indian films are a breed of their own, but ranking the film as high as top 250 all time - better than Vertigo for instance - is pure ridicule.The drama follows the Rocky saga, after difficulties a winner emerges. There is nothing new to the genre, there is nothing surprising and it is all so predictable from the very beginning. The acting is usual childish Indian - good, but yet the storyline is so thin......there a honestly better Indian films (like Wednesday or 3 idiots) where the story line is more unique - and includes better music with the ever beloved Indian dance scenes.I wish IMDb would introduce a regional voting - keeping these films out of Top 250.


                
I am sorry but I went to the theater based on the reviews and the IMDb rating (9/10) and I was like "Wow, this must be an amazing movie". But it is not. I am not from India and I can say the only Indian movies that are good are romantic ones which this movie is not romantic. This movie might be good for Indian people and I think this high rating on IMDb is mainly coming from Indians, but as an international person, this movie was not good at all. The script/dialogues were awful and some part of the movie (like many other Indian movies) was childish. For example, the national coach and Geet's father competition was very weird and not true. The movie was very predictable and it was obvious from the beginning of the movie that what was going to happen during the movie. The only thing that was great was the camera. It was very good. Amirkhan acting was also very good. Altogether, I give this movie 4 out of 1
