BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. TRUST ME THIS FILM IS TERRIBLE. NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 400 Christmas MOVIES. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM FAREThis was a film that suffers because of over length. I am not sure who signed on to the film first. Leo or Tom. One thing is certain Both parts were equal in the amount of screen time each charterer got. This made the film exceptionally long and slow. In this film three-time Oscar winning director Steven Spielberg, Catch Me If You Can follows Frank W. Abagnale, Jr. as he successfully passes himself off as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor - all before his 21st birthday! So many events in this film were fabricated that if you know the true story you can't believe they added so much for dramatic effect that in reality wasn't needed!This film could have cut 30 minutes down easily by combing scenes or even eliminating few. This film could of been a winner.


                
Clearly, the Knock Knock line was the worst thing about this film, which is quite an achievement given that there were a lot of things wrong with this film. It has got to be one of the most shockingly pathetic and useless lines in film history. Unbelievable!


                
This fascinating story & fantastic cast are wasted in this sloppy self-indulgent slice of "Shpielberg." A hack script, Halmark-inspired score and sloppy editing render this potentially gripping movie slightly below average even as brainless entertainment. After a promising turn towards artistry and adrenaline in Minority Report, Spielberg seems to have slid back to his comfort zone of shlocky emotionally manipulative made-for-tv crapolla. While the moral ambiguity and basic plot are nonetheless interesting, seeing the stellar performances by Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio (--who, despite a slight air of inappropriate cynicism seems to have finally recovered from his Titanic fame and returned to his roots as an emotionally gripping actor--) and the absolutely fascinating true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. rendered into 24 carat shlock is a truly unforgivable con-job. With a trendy wave to non-linear narrative Spielberg also guts the movie of any adrenaline value by revealing the outcome of the story in the first three minutes of film. In perhaps the greatest travesty of all, the natural humor of the story is exploited to the extent that it is about as subtle as a fart in an elevator.


                
Tom Hanks, Leo Di Caprio, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Steven Spielberg - how can you go wrong? Very easily by all accounts watching this film.After an hour and a half I couldn't wait for the credits.I almost sunk into a coma when after 2 hours the film appeared to be ending only for it to drag on for another 20 minutes.With some better editing and a more cohesive plot (rather than a sequence of scenes) this film could just about get away with it, if it ran for 90 minutes.Unfortunately none of these apply.


                
Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.Inspired by true story of the con man and runaway thief and fraud checker Frank Abagnale Jr. the story is really interesting in terms of how he disguised himself into so many professions, how many flaws are there in the system. How easy it is to become a pilot, doctor and even a lawyer, how worse are background checks in America and how spineless is FBI too. Now, all this was interesting premise and this is indeed a worth telling tale. Yet, Spielberg made this to a heroic tale of a famous man and how even he has a human side where he loves his parents and wants to be faithful to a girl he loved. I didn't want him to be humane, I would have rather loved if he was lethal and brutal than he is actually shown to be. Tom Hanks here tried to make a fool of himself and I did not like it coz, he failed even failed to make a fool of himself and that's really sad, coz Tom is a fine actor and his acting did not show up here. The movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio who does a fine job and the now superstar who was still a coming up actor in 2002, did show that he had the potential of making it big and his choices have made his career great. Leonardo as Frank comes with all guns blazing for whatever he is asked to do but I just wish his role was more cold blooded and cunning in despising himself and making merry with what goodies he gets. The art direction seems to be fine, but soundtrack of Jazz caught my ears and that was some real good music and I loved the soundtrack. Now, cinematography is good too, yet this is over two hour two minute saga that loses steam by the end. I wish it had more pace and not as lethargic as it is. The supporting cast did their job well and Amy Adams was a really cute pie then and she has come a long way since then.The writing had been a bit more crisper and the scissors been much more tight would have made this chase a delightful one, in a heist and chase movie, we do not expect drama but this loads of it, the father intervenes and the son-father relationship was not so much to my liking coz it was more of a clichéd thing than a fantasy one. The son keeps saying, dad I do this for you, I do that for you, now you and mom be happy. Ah, just cut the crap man.Oh, did I go too harsh in criticizing this movie, yeah I would have coz this is a great film for few but not for me. For me this was kind of routine stuff from a director who made a distinction to himself of making movies or telling stories that are too very engrossing and make us move, be it a ET, Jurassic park or a Schindler's List. Now, Spielberg got down to this and it was an OK attempt not a great one though.I am going with a 2/5 for an average movie from a great director and two of the very good actors we have around. This is what your bread and butter is, I need your gold and diamonds.


                
With a title like "Catch Me If You Can" I was expecting a story with pace and excitement. What I witnessed was a half-hearted and stunted film that seemed to be more concerned with style over content. Surprisingly the film is boring. Considering the strong premise and the talent of the Director I was expecting a light-hearted, fast paced, comedic romp. I was disappointed almost on every level.The opening title sequence was an absolute bore and seemed to go on for an age. The music by John Williams was insipid and uninspired.The Direction was laborious and stilted, almost devoid of emotion. What was he up to?I got the feeling Spielberg rushed too much during the shooting schedule and then refused to cut mercilessly in the edit. Twenty minutes could have easily been slashed to the cutting room floor, especially scenes involving the Tom Hanks character. Could Tom Hanks' ego allowed him to have taken a supporting role in this Picture? I think not. In fact I am sure his part was padded out <U+0096> to the detriment of the whole.Spielberg is a great Director, but has he got a Classic Motion Picture left in him or is he just painting by numbers as this Film seems to suggest?


                
Maybe I've been watching another film to some of the other people on IMDb, or perhaps it's because I've been having my own little classic movie fest over the past two days (with THE BIG SLEEP, THE THIRD MAN, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS etc).  Whatever the case, I was decidedly underwhelmed by Spielberg's latest offering.The cinematography was very pleasing, Leo did a good job, the period detail was all there, there was some nice use of music (though not nearly as much as I was expecting) and there were some brilliant, laugh-out-loud sequences but... it just didn't work for me.  The film's pacing was all wrong IMHO: far too slow at the beginning and between every major con; by the half-way point I was clock-watching, something I very, very rarely do in the movies. Usually I get very easily sucked into a film but in this case I just wasn't. Oh, well, my loss I guess.  In terms of rating, the film gets points for craftmanship but is dragged down by the pacing and Hank's phoned-in performance to a straight average mark of 5/10


                
You'll pardon me for not concurring that this is Spielberg's best film in years (and Lord knows that he keeps sucking my wife and I into those $8.50 box-office tickets anyway)."Minority Report" has been called the antithesis of this so-called 'breezy' film (because the parents in CMIYC "care" -- or at least one of them does) but that's giving Spielberg way too much credit.A word of advice: don't watch "The Grifters"  (which I did the night before viewing this mess), possibly the best con film this side of "The Sting."
Hell, don't even see the underrated "Harry in Your Pocket" or even "The Flim-Flam Man" before checking out this ultimate con of your $$$.Funnily enough, the biggest con here is Steve grabbing the money he lost when you didn't see "A.I." or "Minority Report."And what a mess it is: Tom Hanks manages the worst Massachusetts accent since the lamentable Costner's in "Thirteen Days" (and I'm one of the film snobs who actually LIKES Hanks -- his turn in this year's "Road to Perdition" is worthy of a nomination: not a win, mind you, but a nod).Hanks' accent wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't in approximately every other scene.The Saul Bass-inspired opening creds (think "Pink Panther" flix) and cool initial John Williams score suggests a fun retro film, but this just isn't. It's "Ocean's Eleven" sans the cool.Dispensible characters come and go with no follow-up whatsoever (Jennifer Garner in a truly "what's she doing here?" cameo, Marty Sheen and his daughter-character -- who are actually important to the story, but disappear when their usefulness subsides: basically 10 minutes after their arrival).Though "based on actual events," several interludes smell like Spielberg inventions, not the least of which are Leo's 'just missing' being caught episodes, which play out here like old Marx Bros. sketches -- without Groucho and Harpo and Ms. Dumont.By the way, Leo's pretty good here (how can this 28-year-old still look 16?).But while watching the film I couldn't help but wonder what the book was like -- and comparing Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s exploits as portrayed here to those of the fellow from Michigan who was arrested a few years back. The latter not only impersonated doctors, airline pilots and more but actually performed operations, flew planes, etc. From memory, the guy was the greatest impostor in history.Oh wait, there *was* that old Tony Curtis film, "The Great Impostor" -- maybe I'll have to check that out again as well.Christopher Walken's most endearing role ever (?) in a nice turn as Leo's dad can't overcome the average DP work, Hanks' worst performance in a few years, a really shoddy script and, well, STEVE.Catch it not. But *do* rent "The Grifters." Or "Ocean's Eleven"... even the original. No wait -- stick with the *other* Steven's version ;)4/10 Out


                
This film tells the story of a thief and con man between the ages of 15 and 21. It doesn't stick closely to the real story of his life but takes many liberties with the narrative. It makes him an only child instead of showing his three siblings and changes the timeline so that he does his first major theft and confidence tricks at the age of 16.It is told in a value-neutral way so that you can't admire him for his schemes nor condemn him for his wrongdoing either. You don't care enough about the character to admire or condemn him. He is simply a 'phenomenon'. The actor Lenny D is adequate in the role. He never puts a foot wrong but doesn't stand out either.


                
There are two genuinely touching and funny scenes in here. The rest of the two hours is convulated and contrived. Dicaprio is a class act. But all his charm can not pull the awkwardness out of this movie. Are we sure Spielberg worked on this one?!!!!


                
Spielberg found a great story, but managed to muck it up.  There is too much emphasis on the character of Christopher Walken.  Spielberg continues his slavish devotion to making the father-son relationship the controlling factor in all of his movies since E.T.  Here, it doesn't work, and the far more interesting character of Agent Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is given short shrift.For a cat-and-mouse game, this movie felt more like a pleasant cruise. Frank Abagnale (DiCaprio) was fun to watch, but there was never any tension built up, and the score reflected this as well.  The relationship between Frank and Hanratty was more assumed than developed, and thus a great opportunity was lost.  Still, a fun watch, ** out of ****.


                
**MILD SPOILERS**
I was dragged to see this with the family on Christmas, and it was definitely my least favorite "present" of the day.The main flaw in the film was that of its main character:  Frank Abagnale, Jr.  I can't support a character being portrayed as a 'hero' if in fact they aren't one.  Abagnale had no conscience, no moral center, no concern for all the innocent people he duped and tricked.  Plus the film didn't show how he slipped from perfect schoolboy into cold-hearted conman; it just *happened*. If Abagnale had been portrayed as more of a villain, I would have liked the film more.  Leonardo DiCaprio's largely sleep-walking performance didn't help.I give this film 4 out of 10:  one point for Tom Hanks's excellent portrayal of Carl Hanratty, one point for John Williams's lovely musical score, one point for Thierry Kuntzel's lovely credit sequence, and one for the "airport pickup" gag; you'll know it when you see it.
