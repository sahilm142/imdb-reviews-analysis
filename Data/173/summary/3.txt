 Over-rated, incoherent and boring

 8.5 ?? How many people Tarantino payed for reaching that ?

 The biggest load of self absorbed nonsense and possibly the most stolen ideas in one movie.

 Bang! Slay! Smash! Boom! Rape! Kill! Die! - Welcome to Tarantino's new world!

 Tasteless and tedious - a real let down

 Watered down attempt at a grindhouse film

 A cross between mud wrestling and figure skating

 Not a positive review

 unintentionally campy atmosphere without the humor; adolescent dialogue reminiscent of someone who's ingested too much porn, only without the sex.

 Another singularly insignificent piece of crap

 dissapointing

 So, Does Gore Sell So Much?

 Visually arresting, but lacking in everything beyond.

 Amazingly tasteless for Tarantino

 8.5 ?? How many people Tarantino payed for... - Chapter 2

 Yet another waste of two hours

 I don't get it! A copy

 It was awful

 Not really worth watching for interesting reasons

 Why?

 The music IS the best bit...Really!

 All about making violence beautiful

 Mediocre spaghetti western with too much blood and too little believability

 Another empty Weinstein marketing coup, a truly depressing movie

 20 styles in search of a director
