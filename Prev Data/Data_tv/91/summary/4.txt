 What could have been...

 I have quit watching Dexter after Season 5

 season 1 & 2 fantastic, additional 6 are made for cash-cowing

 well, well...

 Amazing up to season 4

 It started pretty well

 Should have been a masterpiece....boring and pretentious....

 Just pretend it ends after Season 4

 Overrated show!!
