 Chaplin's comment on fascism is his first talking film...

 Immortal classic movie with dual character for Chaplin as barber Jew and Dictator Hynkel

 "Any resemblance between Hynkel the dictator and the Jewish barber is purely coincidental"

 Pretty good Chaplin film with extraordinarily powerful final moments

 The bravest man on earth

 Amazing film, amazing Chaplin

 Chaplin's genius

 Any resemblance between Dictator Hynkel and Jewish Barber is coincidental

 Chaplin's most powerful political statement!

 Hilarious

 Hilarious, and very good, as usual...

 An unsettling mix of great slapstick and cause for alarm.

 A good movie

 Chaplin gives the best of both worlds.

 Slapstick With Drama And Political Commentary!

 Chaplin vs. Authoritarianism

 Truly hilarious, Truly Depressing

 "Any resemblance between Hynkel the dictator and the Jewish barber is purely coincidental"
