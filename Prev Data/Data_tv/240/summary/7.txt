 Pretty good acting and solid storyline, but come on Netflix..

 Confusing aesthetically

 UK or USA?

 Lots that's good but lacking heart

 A good combination of clichè

 Charlie Bartlett?

 Good watch, funny at times, too American.

 This is soft porn

 Entertaining

 Worth the watch

 PG-rated Summer Heights High. Gillian Anderson superb.

 Where is the sex part?

 Good.. I guess

 Underwhelming and too preachy at times but great acting and some funny moments

 Great Potential spoiled by Tired Writing

 Confusing - But a good watch

 So good

 Don't take it too serious it's just a fun loving series
