I look at "Logan" as the "Alien 3" of the X-Men franchise. It basically gives a gigantic middle finger to everything that came before it. It destroys everything the movie that proceeded it ("Days of Future Past") accomplished. In "DOFP", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed, but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then, according to the film "Logan", they all get killed off a few years later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of "Logan" was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film."Logan" is annoyingly low on information. We are thrown into this terribly depressing future without a whole lot of explaining as to how we got here. As I watched, I kept waiting for a scene where things were laid down for the audience. It never came. The best we got were a few vague references here and there. There was something called "The Westchester Incident", but the reference was so fleeting that I barely caught it. There was also another part near the end where the main villain claims that he had something to do with the lack of new mutants being born and that he is Striker's son? I think? It wasn't very clear plus the dude's last name wasn't actually Striker, which further confused the issue. Later on, I hopped online and had a few things clarified (such as the "Westchester Incident"), but why weren't they clearer in the film in the first place?Another issue I have with this film is how it treats the deaths of its two main characters. First, with Xavier, he is stabbed unceremoniously by a clone of Logan about two-thirds the way through the movie. There are no heroics in this death, no greater purpose, no meaning. He's just stabbed and then dies. What a disservice to such an incredible and important character to this franchise. Then there is Logan's death. Logan is impaled by a chunk of wood from a dead tree. The dude literally has a skeleton made out of adamantium, which is the world's most indestructible metal, but yet wood cuts right through it. What? Now, we are shown through the film that Logan is sick and his ability to heal is getting worse, but that shouldn't affect his crazy metal ribcage! They even go to great lengths to explain that the only thing that can really kill him is an adamantium bullet, but in the end a hunk of wood does just as well.Then there is the "R" rating. Once again, if this were a true stand-alone movie and not part of a larger narrative, I'd mostly be OK with it. But of course it isn't. Everything that we got with the "R" rating was unnecessary. What we got was far more blood and gore (there was more than one decapitation), a dump truck full of f-bombs and even one scene where a woman in a bridal shower flashed her boobs. All of this could have been edited out and the film would have been fine.Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I've seen plenty of violent movies, heard plenty of f- bombs and seen plenty of nakedness on film. I'm fine with it, but it has to be there for a good reason. I didn't see a whole lot of good reason here. What really did it for me, though, was seeing a 10-11 year old girl running around slashing off people's body parts. That got to be a bit much for my taste and I began to wonder for whom that kind of stuff didn't bother? Once again, does our society have a bit of a violence fetish, one that has gotten so bad that watching children tear people to shreds is OK? I think the reason for the rating has more to do with a popular trend in movies (especially comic book movies) nowadays than it does with serving this particular story. With the success of "Deadpool" last year, film studios realized that an R-rated super hero film is not only possible, but profitable. But as Malcolm hinted at in the movie "Jurassic Park", just because you CAN do a thing doesn't mean that you SHOULD. For "Deadpool" it works. You can't do "Deadpool" without all that R-rated stuff. That is who "Deadpool" is and that's fine. With Wolverine, however, he's already been established throughout the previous 8 X-Men films. All of these R-rated "upgrades" now don't make a whole lot of sense.When I read positive reviews for this film, the main point that is made is how good the dramatic performances are, especially from the two leads, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. In this case, I completely agree. They did a fantastic job. Even the little girl was amazing, I thought. That can be quite a rarity when you think about how hit and miss child actors are. However, even though most of the performances here are top notch, great performances do not a great film make. If the story sucks, what does it matter? It is hard for me to imagine why Patrick Stewart or Hugh Jackman would be excited to work on a project like "Logan" once they read the script. Were they excited to basically negate all of the great work they did (and others did) in the previous X-Men films? They, better than anyone else, should understand what this whole series has been about since the beginning. Yes, "Logan" is unique and absolutely gave these actors something different to do with their characters. And yes, they gave stellar performances. However, there needs to be at least a little bit of respect for the source material (and its fans) than this. Much like the season premier of "The Walking Dead" this past fall, this seemed more like a kick in the pants for viewers than anything else.
I do not understand the reviews... What the heck? This movie was maybe not worth 1 star, I agree, because I enjoyed the brutality to some extent. But it falls very short of being the sort of masterpiece it is made out to be. I chose to rate it 5.First of all, I am not a fan of Wolverine but I've always admitted that Hugh Jackman was made for this role. And his role in pretty much every X-men movie so far was outstanding. He is the Wolverine.In this movie however, he bored me out of my soul. Even in the brutal scenes he played in, I was not convinced. I understand he is weak and old, and ravaged by Adamantium. But even so, it was not him. He kept whining and suffering and yet I felt nothing. I felt like a narrator who remains as distant as his character as he can. It was cold acting--I do not like cheesy actors either but he clearly left me unaffected. Too bad for a movie that relies on emotion to try and stand out.Now on to the girl. I felt no emotion whatsoever for her either. There was no emotional build-up or any anchorage point I could tie my heart with. She was a dull character. The way she growled and made faces was overdone and... ridiculous. Her role was blurry. She begins as a beast bent on savagery and blood. And a few days later she calls Wolverine "dad"? And she actually has friends waiting for her? Let me have a laugh, I almost fell out of my chair. Several other people summarized her role in action parts; she goes on a killing spree for the first heated scene but at the end of the movie she cannot handle a small troop with her mutant friends--who make the cut by boasting their powers against a man already down and apprehended while she and Wolvie eat dust. ??? Charles-Xavier's lines were bland but at times I was almost convinced. If it wasn't for the unlikable character that the little beast is I'm sure his words would have affected me more. His death was not even moving--and God knows how much I love Charles Xavier.The black family was forgettable. Nothing with them engaged my attention. Except the fact they served as a redemption for a Wolverine that had given up on standing for what it is to be an x-men. And even so he failed. Because of a plot twist character who was there for the sake of adding more Jackman for fan service.But most of all... What happened? For the whole movie I craved some flashbacks, some relevant explanation for Caliban, Xavier, the disappearance of the other X-men, for Wolvie degrading so much, for his copy's reason to exist--why not copy much more powerful mutants that must have been out there. My head was dizzy with lack of information and all it got was a few sentences.I am honestly quite the easy-going guy. I was not full of expectations prior to the movie. I actually expected the movie to be bad so that I could be less critical or hyped up. I wanted to avoid being disappointed. And while the beginning looked promising, it just went downhill when I felt my questions were poorly resolved, or when the girl's incoherent role showed more and more.Perhaps the unmemorable soundtrack played its part, perhaps the questions I kept asking myself and the writing inconsistency spoiled my appreciation of the movie. But so it happened and whereas I know the movie tried hard to be emotional and do Wolverine justice, it actually did the opposite.In a movie in which all I can remember are screams and growls and bloodshed a la Tarantino, Hugh Jackman's last role as the Wolverine is forgettable and painful.
I went in with an expectation of a "typical" X-Men movie, without reading the reviews here ... Just saw the "Star" ratings. I don't know who these people are give 10 stars, for sure either they had very a very low expectations from this or are paid raters. My problem with this movie is that you cannot take a total fictional Sci-Fi character and put him in a real life situation, where he is a beat up limo driver, fighting the Mexican thugs trying to steel his Limo's "Chrome plated rims" ... from the start I lost interest in it, after that it just drags, extra long scenes and not to mention that this movie happened in future, where all the mutants are gone/hunted down, yet no real advancements, people still shooting with 12 gauge shotguns ...There are No Mountain Range North Dakota bordering Canada .... Guys if you wanna make a movie about reality ... it should have some reality for a fictional Character ... It Just Sucked
The high ratings for this film are based entirely on its sombre tone. That's a great novelty in a 'superhero' movie, to be sure. But it merely masks the film's emptiness - its painful lack of ideas, lack of character development, and total absence of plot.Jackman's performance? As someone once quipped, his emotional range runs the full gamut... from A to B. He looks grumpy and depressed in every scene. In every shot. Patrick Stewart is somewhat more nuanced, though he too is hamstrung by a script that gives his character the emotional depth of a cartoon. Dafne Keen does a great job as Laura, but her character has only attitude - which incompetent screen writers often mistake for character.Visually, the film is bland. I hear there's a black-and-white version. It's always a bad sign when a film's creators can't make up their minds on such a key issue. A film is either shot for B&W, or it isn't. (In the case of Logan, the photography lacks the dramatic contrasts and strong composition that might favor a noir-ish B&W presentation.)Logic holes abound:* After being raised in a cage, Laura turns out to be a competent driver. What's more, she has no trouble reaching the pedals, presumably on account of some stretching power that's not mentioned elsewhere in the film.* Laura is mute for half the film, for no apparent reason. Then she can only speak Spanish. Then fluent English. No explanation.* Laura is often feral, as you'd expect of someone raised in a cage by sadistic scientists. Yet she acts like a normal child most of the time. Ditto for her friends. This quality does not 'develop' as a result of events in the film - it simply materializes when needed.* Laura drives at random, ends up at a completely out-of-the-way building. And meets all her friends. When was this arranged? How did she learn navigation while locked in a cage?* Logan and Laura have a cozy evening with a nice family - knowing full well that they're setting them up for slaughter, when their pursuers come along. The audience knows this instantly, characters in the film don't quite get it.* Logan is dying, we're never told why. Professor X has a brain-cloud, or some such dread condition, also not explained.Missed opportunities are equally plentiful:* Laura's feral attacks are mentioned in conversation, but never really discussed. Logan dismisses them with a couple of heavy one-liners, when they could have (and should have) led to an extended rumination on violence. The film doesn't miss a beat when Laura's friends brutally murder the guy with the mechanical hand. This lynch-mob logic should, again, have been a starting point for reflections that never happen in this shallow, trivial film.* Logan never has a character arc. Wolverine actually has far less emotional range in this film than in the first X-Men movie. His relationship with Laura is essentially the same as the far more developed relationship with Rogue.* Characters are neither built up, nor revealed. To do that, you have to show them in a range of different circumstances, dealing with emotionally or morally challenging dilemmas. In Logan, the only dilemma is how to keep eluding inexorable pursuit so as to stretch the film out past the two-hour mark. Hence the only character trait that can be revealed is dogged perseverance. We get that in the first scene. After that, nothing.* Ultimately, the filmmakers resort to having Logan shaved back to his familiar Wolverine muttonchops. You know you're in trouble when you're counting on facial hair to create characterization. (Or fan service.)* Plot is nonexistent. The film is one long chase. Weak screenwriters often mistake this for plot, but it's a poor substitute: totally linear, predictable, boring. Yes, there have been great 'chase' films (Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway comes to mind.) They take care to incorporate twists and turns, and strong moments of characterization. Logan doesn't. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens.On top of everything else, I had the creeping suspicion that this film was calculated less as a standalone work, than as a stepping-stone for the X-Men 'franchise.' It disposes of two performers who've stated their intent to depart the roles they created. And it seems to pave the way for the endlessly-discussed New Mutants franchise. Ugh. Replacing the people won't make up for a lack of ideas, and Logan shows very clearly how bereft of creative thinking the X-Men cinematic franchise has become.I didn't hate Logan as I was watching it. But when it ended I was overcome by a feeling of emptiness and disappointment. This film lacks both entertainment value and deep ideas. The Marvel cinematic universe badly needs a shot of new blood, but sadly, this wasn't it.
This is my first review even though I have been a member here since late 90's early 2000s. This is due to the fact that I don't understand the love for this movie.This movie stumbles about trying to figure out how to be a road trip movie with a western genre landscape and superhero theme. The result is a pretentious sloppy mess that takes itself too serious while giving very little regard to the films that led to this one.The fans that requested an "R" rating did so with the thinking that it would open up the film to be more free with the character. Instead it felt like it was pigeon holed into justifying the R rating from the senseless breast flashing to random F-bombs that don't fit the characters as presented previously in the last 17 years.The 2:21 run time seemed to drag past three hours as I felt a lack of empathy for any of the characters as they are not fully developed and flushed but rather used as props for beautiful shots against the desert and country roads of Mexico and rural America.Logan's disregard to the other characters in the film was forced and lacked any connection to the empathetic character we were introduced to in the original X-Men film in which we were introduced to a character that felt compelled to help Marie D'Ancanto after encountering her on the road. Logan, though he has tried to be a loner, never really was a loner without any empathy. That is until this movie and the motivation for this lack of empathy towards a little girl and her issues is troubling as a movie goer. I can not find a reason to recommend this movie or to see it again outside of the beautiful cinematography throughout the film.


                
Seeing how many people have praised this movie, i decided to give it a whirl.2 hours and 18 minutes later i came away saddened that my time had not been spent in a more entertaining way.Logan trundles the story like a helpless blind man whose hands have inexplicably been replaced by running chainsaws in a slaughterhouse. Its bloody, but the violence has no substance nor sense of direction.Why would any viewer care about a rapidly self-healing demigod brawling it out with gunslingers and other mutants, when him winning the encounter appears to just be a question of time or bullets?As such, even from the position of somebody that enjoys violent or bloody movies, it has to be said that none of the action scenes emit any pathos. They just happen.The dialogue is bland and forgettable, as are the adversaries and their motivations. It might have been more efficient for the majority of them to say just plainly admit that they are the bad guys in order to allocate even more screen time to the violence.I really wanted to like this movie, but i just don't see any good reason to. As such, a 4/10 seems alright.


                
Logan - Touted as a sci-fi western, it definitely lived up to the moniker. Far-reaching deserts and a minimalist score really set the stage. James Mangold wrote and directed it, but I wish he had put down the pen. Each scene is thoughtfully shot, but it's the story within those shots that left me wanting. The positives for me, beyond the ambiance, were two standout performances by under the radar actors. Stephen Merchant, who is usually in English sitcoms, went way off type with his character. Given his past roles I thought it was an odd casting choice at best, but now I couldn't picture anyone else doing what he did. The other was Boyd Holbrook, who played the main antagonist. The subtle choices he made in line delivery and how he carried himself made him a magnetic presence on screen. The film was much more engaging while they were involved in a scene. And then there are the negatives...As I alluded to earlier, the story was just not there. There's weak motivation throughout for both Wolverine and the villains. The movie creates its own plot holes unnecessarily and leans on tropes and off screen happenings to propel it along. The action scenes are an exercise in redundancy. Slash this guy, stab that guy, try stabbing and slashing this person, now mix it up a bit and slash THEN stab this guy. Once you see the first fight you'll have seen them all. And finally there are the inconsistencies with the special effects. They could create extremely detailed battle damage, but couldn't remove the prominent scar on the forehead of the self- healing girl. They could green screen prosthetic arms for multiple characters, but couldn't remove the reflection of the camera in peoples' sunglasses. These, and other details, while minor, added up quickly. Suffice it to say, this western did anything but ride off into the sunset. 4.5/10.


                
This is Wolverine, he is the most beloved of all the X-men because he is a badass, and they turned him into this pondering, coughing, old weakling, that i need to be sorry for. And how they killed him, by loosing badly a fight with a villain. Well at least he wasn't killed by an embolism or another old man disease like Professor Xavier almost was, if he wasn't put out of his misery. Is this year 2029 after the year in which the events that would have happened in X-men:Days of Future Past? Because in that one the technology displayed was way more advanced, and Wolverine did not seem poisoned by the adamantium.This clearly was not a super hero movie, i like a gritty action movie, this was not. This was a drama about two old dying men, with 5 action scenes(great action scenes, this is how Wolverine should had been portrayed), but still a drama. When i go to see a mma fight i don't want to see a play about the meaningless of a pointless life, or the inevitability of death. I see a trend in the superhero movies in which a character of a series needs to die for the series to be rebooted. Yes Hugh Jackman was great at playing the role, but you don't need to kill him to replace him as Wolverin.
Using my own rating system 4 means I will not watch again. All Spoilers.So it has been a while since I have seen Logan but there were a few things that just annoyed me watching the movie.So I am pretty sure in the research facility they wanted to kill the children. So then why did they capture the little girl and not kill her immediately.Secondly these kids were supposed to have been trained from birth how to fight using their powers. I remember they resisted the training but still their fighting skills were pretty crap from being trained from birth. Then the self-driving trucks they showed no signs of slowing down to prevent a collision with the horses.Small things I know but took away from the movie for me.
I did not enjoy this movie because of the poor direction.The story was dull and yes people are all telling that its wolverine's last movie what do you expect. Personally i feel like the direction was poor.This just doesn't feel like a superhero movie and its directed with a lot of warm colours. Ill tell you one thing the movie achieved ,it did make me sad.Sad to a point where i felt like walking out of the theatre.Such a draggy movie.I know a lot of you out there must have enjoyed it.Don't get influenced by the critics ratings.Just sit and watch the movie and try to think from your own point of view what you enjoyed in the movie.It was not the perfect ending to wolverine....please....I so wanted this to be good.


                
I believe that I am about to disagree with quite a few people now. You see, I did not like this movie.Not that this came as much of a surprise to me. What I got was pretty much what I expected. From a technical point of view the movie is quite well done. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are doing good jobs as always. The action scenes are good. The cinematography is not at all bad. If you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. The technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. If I would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting.For me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. The only reason I watched it is because I, as a X-Men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but I would have been happier it this movie had never been made.Wolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. Professor X is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. We get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs.The entire movie is dark in spirit with the X-Men all but died out and Wolverine and Professor X just waiting to die. Then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of Wolverine. She pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and Wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to Wolverine who seems to think everyone should go (censored) themselves so that he can continue to self destruct.The bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on X- Men, genetics etc. Supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of X-Men but of course they keep their own little army of "enhanced" humans that doggedly harasses Wolverine & Co. There are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. No one with enough Charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count X-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie.By the way, why the (censored) do Wolverine, Laura as well as X-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight?The story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. A typical Hollywood drama. Not really anything to write home about.The movie is just so depressing from start to finish. As a last farewell to Wolverine and Professor X it is almost insulting. I know a lot of people seem to like it but I cannot understand why. At least not if you are a X-Men fan.


                
Logan is a movie loosely based on the comic book Old Man Logan where an old retired wolverine takes a cross country trip in search of money and redemption. The comic book was great but I can't say the same for Logan. Many people say they love this movie and the dark rated R format really captures the true essence of the wolverine character which I agree with but as a movie, I just hated it. The movie starts off strong with Wolverine dismantling a Mexican gang and the portrayal of an ill Professor X, but after that all that really happens is a boring back story of X-23, Wolverine yelling at X-23 and Charles, Logan and X-23 flailing their claws killing people, and more of Hugh Jackman yelling. By the time the movie was 2/3 through I couldn't take it anymore I was overwhelmed with boredom and bad acting (mostly from the actress who portrayed Laura/X-23). Overall I just felt let down by the writers. They could've done so much more with the script but they kept it to a long boring Wolverine movie with an unnecessary ambiguous destruction of the X-Men and Mutants with very little Easter eggs on what actually happened. This movie completes the Wolverine trilogy of bad writing and a waste of the Wolverine character and Hugh Jackman.
I will say - for starters - that you won't be able to watch another movie featuring Wolverine in it the same. There is simply so much carnage throughout (as well as f-bombs) that it just makes sense for who Wolverine is as a character. Unfortunately, he's dying of old age because of adamantium poisoning (this reminds me of the midi-chlorian revelation in Star Wars Episode I). Sadly - and worst of all - we only get to see Wolverine in his prime for about 5 minutes, and this is only because he takes something that makes him operate at peak level until it wears off. You won't even believe the ending.... ***SPOILER ALERT*** The ending is about as anti-climactic as you can get in this situation. I think it would've been more epic if he walked off into the sunset. He dies saving the girl from the previews (X-23) and some other children. But the way the main baddie is killed doesn't make sense with previous Wolverine movies (which this movie tries to tie together). ***SPOILER ALERT #DOS*** (The main baddie has his head blown off with an adamantium bullet shot from a snub-nosed pistol. I won't tell you why that doesn't make sense, but you'll figure it out.)Having a movie featuring X-23 is not feminist (notice how I use the word "featuring"). The problem is that she's featured as basically half of the main story. This movie serves as an origin movie of sorts for her as well as an ending for Wolverine as we know him. I don't think X-23's story is completely distracting, but I do feel that it partially takes away from the going-away party for Logan. They turned her into some sort of savage beast with perfect fighting prowess. She gets hurt maybe once in the whole movie. When she's being shot at no one can hit her (professional mercenaries with robotic arms for even more accuracy), and the other times Logan is saving her. She's tearing into the main baddie at the end of the movie in a ridiculous fashion without a scratch on her (while Logan fights the same baddie and ends up completely mutilated). She's basically impervious to damage and is literally perfect at fighting (she can't be stopped -- even more-so than Wolverine ever was). It's funny how this movie attempts to be realistic with Wolverine and yet neuters itself in the way it treats X-23. They even go so far as to have a scene where Xavier explains that it's "obvious" she would have a claw in her foot because female lions do all the hunting and are the reason the pack survives and they use their back claws as well as their front claws and yada yada... It's all pretty strange and confusing. And of course Xavier says that she can learn to be better than Wolverine. FEMINIST MESSAGING blehhhh.Logan's last purpose on earth is to save X-23 and help a diverse group of mutant kids cross the border into Canada (the only place they can find freedom is in Canada apparently -- they look for a place called "Eden," but we never know in the end whether or not it exists). Also, on that note, there's an odd scene where individuals are driving from Mexico into the US holding an American flag in a pickup truck shouting "USA!" to immigrants from Mexico -- like they're rubbing it in their faces (very odd to say the least). I wonder if Hollywood injected their view on immigration at all.... Also of note is that all the bad guys are white. I'm noticing this trend in Hollywood (this reminds me a lot of The Force Awakens) where all the bad guys are white males while the good guys are females and minorities -- no young, white males are featured as heroes. I find this trend disturbing because Hollywood makes white males appear to be the enemy while offering no white, male heroes. They also use stereotypically racist scene in this movie: White farmers gang up on a black farmer for no apparent reason.Much of the plot is very ho-hum and boring. There is a cool twist in the middle of the film that I won't ruin because I think it's the only thing that makes this movie interesting. Other than that twist, this movie would be very boring. Basically all of Wolverine's redemption and last stand is him grudgingly going along with protecting X-23 and, eventually, her friends (and him dying in the process). He's buried with a strange speech by X-23 that's half about Logan and really more about her (it literally sounds like she's reading the script describing her character). She takes the cross out of the ground, turns the cross on its side to make an "X," and then walks away while sadly looking back at Logan's grave. The idea of adamantium poisoning Logan could make sense -- but only in a separate reality from all other X-Men movies. His healing powers haven't withered -- he just suddenly can't fend off the poison from his own skeleton. He ages very rapidly from his physical prime to being near-death in about 16 years. It simply doesn't make sense. Showing Wolverine with all blood and gore turned "on" is awesome. X-23's amazing fighting ability doesn't make sense (even though it's cool at times). Her being trained as an assassin is never explained in the movie, and there's no way a child would be that good so quickly! This movie is really about X-23. It's a father-daughter movie. It all feels like a "been there, done that" type of a thing, and I think they ruined this movie with their messaging. The feminist nods, the racial nods, the immigration nods, and the fact that this movie is really about X-23 all distract from the story being about Logan and serving it's main purpose -- having an epic send-off for Wolverine.
Three words come to mind when reviewing Logan; nihilistic, violent and depressing. There's really not a lot to like here. This is a film about a nihilistic lead character and the ugly violent events, that seem to envelop his life like a dark, perpetual gloom. Indeed, what most defines this film is endless, bloody violence. So much so that the simple story of redemption that's supposed to lift the viewer up is obscured and for the most part, silenced. What you are left with, is a rather depressing film, that, sucked dry of any real sense of hope, staggers towards its inevitable demise. Four out of ten from me.


                
Because it is part of long-running franchise, however, it comes across as painfully incongruous with previous X-Men movies. At the outset of the movie, we see that Logan has descended once again into misery, so all of the gains made in "The Wolverine" are lost. Once again also, mutants are on the edge of extinction, so all gains made in "Days Of Future Past" are lost (and less than 10 years later, to add to the bewilderment). Basically, it looks like some writer liked the idea of rebooting the mutant doomsday concept of DOFP and taking it in a bleaker direction.I'm sorry, but while excellent acting is something I like in a movie, a good story is at least as important, and to make a good story, you can't render previous entries in the franchise completely pointless. The fact that this happens in the final Wolverine outing, with no opportunity to recover is, of course, all the more heartbreaking. I was surprised when DOFP managed a decent recovery from the mistakes made by X-Men:Last Stand, but not as surprised as I was to see those same mistakes repeated here!


                
I know I am in the minority, but I didn't care much for this movie. It was predictable, for the most part. It dragged on for a while and was not very engaging. There were some sort of good moments here and there, and Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman's performances were great. But overall not a movie I would care to watch. I will give it one more chance, but right now I am rating it 4/10 to be generous.


                
OK, so it was big budget with lots of CGI and one good scene, but the rest was just boring. Slooow to kick off, lots of repetitive violence of the same kind, little emotional attachment to any character (especially the girl, who spends most of her time either doing bugger all or making holes in people's heads, shoulders, knees and toes), a plot so compromised Logan himself couldn't make any more holes in it with his pointy bits. One very annoying technical aspect was the cheap lens they used that created really noticeable parallax distortion every time the operator pulled focus. Made me feel ill. Have you noticed that any Marvel film gets highly rated on IMDb - I'm convinced they employ lots of kids in bedrooms to submit fake reviews.


                
The film begins with a broken down Wolverine (aka Logan). Already sick and miserable. We are left with little to no information of the occurrences beyond X-Men Days of Future Past. While that movie ended with hope this begins in despair. Almost like mad max most of the beginning is some desolate wasteland. Charles Xavier is kept away from others due to his seizures that inadvertently (*hinted*) have killed all his X-Men. Wow. Could that just get any worse? How about watching 2 hours of a little girl fight and destroy in all the ways you keep hoping Logan (The Wolverine) would get into gear. Wait. And Wait.... Oh last 20 minutes. There you go. Done. Depressing Close. Movie over. To watch the performance of the actors - magnificent performances and it's not the actors fault for the bad writing, the plot-holed story line, or the absolute depressing overtone throughout most of the movie. I understand we're all bound to get old, to eventually be just as broken and pathetic as these heroes were on screen. But honestly stomaching almost 2 hours of despair, hopelessness, and slow death. Like watching a loved one suffer in pain and unable to do much. It's almost heartbreaking. While I "hail to the King" of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) they performed wonderfully and truly brought their characters to life. However, they unwittingly brought them to a most pathetic end. The millions of ways they could've ended this, or re-wrote this, or done anything with. And they made this garbage. I will never keep this one in the collection despite their amazing performance. (Same with Wolverine Origins) Way to undo everything you fixed in DOFP. C'est la vie - Next!
Fiercely hyped from the get-go, Logan carries with it a mature tone and the knowledge that it is The Last Wolverine Movie. Everyone is rough and ragged and tired. Unfortunately the mature tone of most of the film is diluted with the kind of comic book silliness seen in the other X-Men films (i.e. clones, evil scientists), so it's hard to accept scenes of beloved characters feeling intense emotions when they are immediately followed by adolescent ultraviolence in a campy situation. It's an okay flick, but its general acceptance by fans as a great movie shows that the bar isn't set high enough.


                
I like X-Men but after watching this one...please no more Wolverine. So much drama and sadness I wanted to shoot myself after watching it. What happened to comic heroes? It's people with powers doing crazy stuff.Why do they made the characters so real? What, it is easier to understand their drama? An old guy with iron claws and a little girl killing people? And that sad old fart bold guy with mind powers? Really?Give me back the Friday night X-Men movie where there's action and humor. Because it's a movie based on comics. You know, fun?
Alright, I'll just get straight to the point here. This movie and Mad Max: Fury Road have to be the most overrated movies that have come out in the past two years. However, the only difference between this movie and Fury Road is that, Fury Road was actually a GOOD movie. Overrated, but still good.This movie just disappointed me so much and the people on IMDb and others of the internet are the main reason why I was so disappointed by this film after seeing it - they hyped the sh*t out of it. Ever since I heard that Logan was going to be released in 2017 I always knew I was going to go see it but I kept my expectations low due to past experiences with the Fox/XMEN franchise. Had I avoided the internet and went and watched the movie, I wouldn't be as disappointed as I am right now because just a few days before I saw it, my spirit was falsely lifted and I was misled into believing that this was something different - but it's not. Honestly, it's not.So what's bad about the movie? Oh, nothing new (in the context of the Fox/XMEN franchise) - weak plots, terrible CGI, unconvincing stunts, poor action and bad character development...the usual stuff, literally - nothing new. Keep your expectations at this level and you'll leave the theatre satisfied, trust me.However, not all is bad about this movie - the picture, the sound-tracking and the acting are quite good to be honest. Hugh Jackman gives a very good performance in the first two acts until he loses his touch as the plot also loses its mojo in the very clearly unclear third act but that's nothing to complain about. Sir Patrick Stewart was also good but I didn't enjoy his performance that much but good nonetheless.I'm not going to dwell on a lot because I might go on forever. Basically what you need to know is that this movie is nothing new (overall) from what we've been given by this franchise and don't even get me started on the desperate and lousy attempt at being R Rated. You've seen one Wolverine movie, you've seen them all. I'm one of the few people who believes that the best film this franchise has ever given us was First Class (what a beauty). The Weapon X story that was being set up in Apocalypse would've been a worthier effort honestly if they stuck with the continuity.This movie is a solid 6 at best.


                
-----disclaimer------ Ever since I started being a movie junkie, I have never given any slightest attention to movie reviews, especially those percentages on RottenTomatoes or IMDb. I encourage everyone else to do the same, make your own judgment for a movie based on your preferences instead of letting someone else telling you what to like or to dislike. The following review is my very first review without the intention of persuasion. Also, I don't spoil. Any possible detail related to the movie in my review can all be seen in trailers. -----review----------Superhero movies, in my regard, should serve a purpose of giving the younger generation hopes, inspirations, or courage for life. I believe that is why some of the famous superhero comics came out in the first place. The movie 'Logan' features the well-known characters Professor Xavier(brain) and Wolverine(brawn), but it paints a gloomy picture for these two characters' journey as if it attempts to constantly remind the audience that there is a supposedly forced reality kicking in. It seems that the script targets at a certain range of audience which clearly includes adults but not primarily the younger generation despite the fact the script implies the notion of legends passed on from generation to generation. I have no objection about it, am only slightly disappointed about a gloomy superhero movie with such great characters in it.The second thing I intend to point out here is that, it seems that this movie does not want to give a clearer background of the antagonists. If the antagonists were given a much fairer amount of time to be introduced to the audience, I am sure I as one of the audience would not feel as if the villains are bunch of coyotes coming out of nowhere chasing down the protagonists on the road. If I want a script which puts more focus on action and less on the reason behind, I would prefer watching pornography. Third, the plot holes. I am sure many have pointed out several major plot holes in previous reviews, as a guy who promises not to spoil, I will say no more. Every movie has sins, plot holes are considered sins as well. However, when they are too many, the story is thus ruined.Last, let's imagine ourselves to be the screenwriter: "Hey, let's have a senile wise man, an invincible tough guy who is known for having lived for a long long time of life but now all of a sudden has trouble staying that way, and a little young girl, make these three on a road trip while being chased down by villains! That would be awesome!" When I was somewhere in the mid of the movie, I started to question myself: who wrote this simple minded d screenplay?! There are in fact more to talk about to express my dissatisfaction toward this movie, but those would involve spoiling the plot so I will stop here. Overall, I have to say, the script is predicable, too predicable. This is the kind of script that I would expect from the drama contests back in my university days.


                
Just saw the movie Logan and wow, how depressing! Logan is an alcoholic who has pretty much lost all his great wolverine abilities. Throughout the movie I kept telling myself that he will make his triumphant return, Sadly no. What's the point of the other Xman movies if this is what the future holds for them? Please if your feeling gloom in anyway, don't go see.
Forty minutes into it and the 4th pointless action sceneThousands of rounds of bullets fired at, you guessed it, characters that aren't killed by bullets. No decipherable principal plot has emerged so far.When stars don't want to make a movie they ask for ridiculous sums of money. The studios must have the requisite action sequences so there is no money left in the budget for supporting characters or interesting locations. Just an army of minions shooting guns in the desert, that don't speak any lines, at least not in English.The studios are trapped. They are hooked on comic book franchises and those audiences that flock to them regardless of quality.We need a new rating system - this movie is rated for people younger than 18 or of diminished capacity.


                
Well, the action scenes were amazing to be honest. But this movie was obviously intended to be emotionally driven, and, while many people praise it for that, I felt like every emotional manipulative cliché was there. For example *spoilers* when the whole yacht thing between Charles and Logan was mentioned, I already suspected where it would go from there. The cowboy movie scene? If you have seen more than five movies you could see from a mile away it was gonna come in play later. And the ending? Yeah, I understand, it was a downer ending, but they used the ''character you didn't want to die dying'' so many times in the movie, I felt nothing. And what about Laura? I knew nothing about her by the end of the movie, and the relationship between them was bland for me. One week? And we're supposed to believe the kid that has killed and saw people get killed, is crying? OK he is her father but... it felt forced. The whole emotional part of the movie felt forced. And when a huge part of your movie is based on emotional manipulation, a no for me.
