 my all-time favorite television show

 Damnfine series

 Fantastic

 brilliant and hilarious

 What might have been.

 Everyone's Talking About It. The Talk Is Good and Bad. It Definitely Strikes a Nerve.

 Network television at its absolute best

 David Lynch's masterpiece

 I still remember the night it premiered... and being mesmerized by the opening

 Good TV Series with a very bad ending

 Wow, Bob, Wow...

 Absolutely a must see!!!

 Surreal and one of the best TV series...

 Brilliant actors & story line - but obviously the network forced the writers into uncomfortable timing problems.

 An Extraordinary Production, Despite An Inferior Continuation After The Second Half Of The Second Season

 I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time - but in 2017 the 1990 version is, well, just bad

 Over-polished and too fashion-modelized.

 absolute nonsense and must be avoidable show

 A brilliant and original show that progressed way too quickly.

 Twin Peaks losing its plot

 absolutely fantastic series

 Hardly the sensation I was expecting.

 Tragically beautiful

 OMG!! WOW!!! The best TV series I've ever seen!

 The Valley of Death
