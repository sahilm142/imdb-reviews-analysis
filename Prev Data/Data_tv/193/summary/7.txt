 The best British comedy of the '90s

 Brilliant

 Comedy as it's meant to be

 What TV should be, and a pity is so unknown outside the UK

 Painful to watch...

 ranks right up there with "the Office", and "Faulty Towers"

 Why the dodgy reviews ? This is one of the best !!

 An excellent addition

 Ten on ten

 Never been topped

 The 90s Greatest Sit Com

 Up with the Partridge

 To hell with Ricky Gervais and The Office

 Ah hahahaha

 Even Better

 I couldn't stop laughing!

 The Best of the Three

 Hilarious sitcom

 Right away, it had me by the jaffas

 Alan... you're AMAZING

 Classic intercourse

 ...and you use the leaves to make a dress for your wife who's also your brother

 Dry English Humor

 We need a German Alan Partridge

 Rude Dawbings
