 A Three-Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film

 Other people's money. High life of a stockbroker.

 Goodfellas Meets Wall Street Meets Biting Black Comedy

 Hugely entertaining, if a little long

 The Great Leonardo!

 I have recently watched "The Wolf of Wallstreet" and I'd like to share a few thoughts about this movie with you<U+0085>

 3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.

 Excessively excessive comedy

 Good, but morally queasy

 Quick Review

 Why Leo, why?

 Entertaining but empty

 It was a good film, but I was let down

 The wolf of wall street!

 Wasn't crazy about this movie

 Great film and worthy of a few Oscars

 Fifths is not a charm for Leo

 A Great Watch! 8/10

 At last a Leonardo DiCaprio film that makes me laugh in so many ways

 Entertaining at most

 Highly Entertaining, fast paced and funny... but exactly that's the problem!

 One of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances.

 great biopic from scorcese

 Great, not perfect...
