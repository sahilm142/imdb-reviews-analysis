 WWI comedy series with great lines

 Surely This Is The Best British Comedy Series?

 T.V.'s greatest scene?

 Better Yet Again

 Blackadder Goes Forth

 Best of the Best

 It doesn't get any better than this.

 Hilarious. Just brilliant.

 Brought tears of laughter and sadness

 Still hilariously funny, but also the darkest of the Blackadders

 Classic British Comedy

 The best war comedy ever made!

 As good as anything ever made.

 Rowan Atkinson at his best.

 I'm glad there wasn't a fifth

 The Best of British Comedy

 Whoever thought the first world war could be so funny?

 I have a cunning plan...
