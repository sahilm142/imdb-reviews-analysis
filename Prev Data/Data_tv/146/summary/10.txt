 A gaze to the abyss. Die Dunkelheit

 Very good mystery stuff and sure no copy of stranger things!

 Appropriate title, truly superb series

 A German MASTERPIECE

 Awesome take on the time genre

 If you want something stranger than stranger things WATCH THIS !!

 Probably the best series i have ever seen

 This is nothing like "Stranger Things"

 Germany's long time overdue step into genre shows

 10/10 It's not German Stranger Things, it is it's own thing.

 Show is great.

 Excellent Series! (Switch on the original language and watch it with subtitles)
