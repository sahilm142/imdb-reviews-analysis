 Cold-hearted

 Okay, but what was the fuss all about? Accents??

 One of the most overrated movies in history!!

 One of the funniest dark comedies of all time.

 Good Crime Comedy-Thriller!

 A list of my favorite actors in a film that is both real and completely boring

 Bleak comedy

 Quirky characters, dark humor

 Well-acted but totally overrated

 "Blood has been shed, Jerry."

 Not entertaining!!!

 Enjoyable, exploitative

 Adorably funny and bit twisted

 Home-spun, entertaining and unexpected but sometimes slow and meandering.

 Dark Humor

 Decent

 Minnesota gets nailed and shredded

 A very solid, well-made Coen brothers film

 Interesting...

 it was a mixup, i guess

 Fargo

 Great dark comedy you betcha!

 Dark comedy crime story
