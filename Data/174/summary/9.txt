 Very well-made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema view...

 What we have here is no failure

 The Sin of the Angry Believer

 a classic anti-hero and a near-great Hollywood prison movie of the 1960s

 One person can give purpose to life for others, no matter where

 A straight-forward film that has more than meets the eye

 Shaking' it here, boss!

 Never fails to communicate

 Over-aged rebel without a cause

 Exceptional prison film with wonderful Newman at the helm, aided by a stellar cast.

 Prison classic with a career-best Newman

 Before "Shawshank" there was "Cool Hand Luke"

 Luke: A Man Like No Other

 "Yeah, well, sometimes nothing means a real cool hand".

 Newman created one of the most indelible anti-authoritarian heroes in film history with his dynamic portrayal of the title character.

 Paul Newman...He's a real Cool Hand

 A Great Film

 Well done movie

 Truly amazing movie

 Seminal 60s movie

 "He's a natural born world shaker"

 one of Newmans best

 A movie unique in a class and style all of its own.

 If you don't fit in, shake the world.

 love it!
