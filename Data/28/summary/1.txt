 Over-wrought.

 The cake is a lie.

 Ending Not a Surprise

 Stupid gimmick stupid movie

 The movie lies

 Why bother with a plot?

 great trick or dirty trick?

 Usual Suckspects

 Pretentious

 No redeeming qualities whatsoever

 A cheat

 Most Overrated film of all time

 Must... like... movie... (spoilers, but who cares, the movie sucks...)

 People actually like this?!

 Can you say Overrated?

 Don't take two hours out of your life and waste on this total screw-up

 A rather boring movie.

 Boring and Predictable

 A piece of crap!

 sad to say, despite the twist, this one does not bare the test of time

 Shocking and surprising - if you're an idiot

 Your kidding......

 Somewhat silly in retrospect

 as far as Stephen Baldwin movies go, about as good as "Bio-dome"

 Unstylistic homage to better noir films, or Old wine in new cheap bottle
