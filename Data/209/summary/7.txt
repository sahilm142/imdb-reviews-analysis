 A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity

 Americanism Through Foreign Eyes

 A future masterpiece classic for sure.

 A great character-driven crime film.

 A great Denis Villeneuve drama with an incredible turn by Hugh Jackman

 A little disappointed

 Crime Story For Adults.

 Missed Opportunity

 Glum, overlong, and goes off the rails before the end

 Too many flaws to be a great film.

 A future masterpiece classic for sure

 Better Than I Had Originally Thought, But Still Problematic

 A future masterpiece classic for sure.

 Very Trueful movie

 Great cinematography, underwhelming story

 An Intricate Thriller of Emotional & Moral Complexities.

 Solid film with even better performances.

 Pray for the best, prepare for the worst...

 A good film!

 A decent (if absurd) mystery that is gorgeously shot and competently told

 Creepy, well crafted and acted, solid drama

 Very well done, super depressing

 Just shy of brilliant.

 Trivial plot improved by fine directing and acting

 worth watching!
