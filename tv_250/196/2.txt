After the earlier series of great substance and after a really gritty film, this is poor. The writing is weak and boring and the costume designer should be sacked....there is a guy at the end in the disco scene wearing a Hatebreed t-shirt (a band that didn't come out until 94 and didn't get popular until the late 90's.) This is set in 1990.....very very poor costume design. How did anyone miss that??? Especially a programme that has its roots in showing skinhead culture. The two clowns with the moustaches letting a lady take a huff on a bud is laughable. Shane meadows is one of the best British directors and i think dead mans shoes is amazing as is the previous this is england series, but this seems like it is going down hill.
