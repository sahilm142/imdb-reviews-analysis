 Kill Bill-my take

 A Homage to the Kung Fu Movies, Take a Bow from us Tarantino, u are god of movie making.

 Tarantino's best

 From Spaghetti Western to Old Japanese films to Matrix visual effects equals a cool, bloody, action-packed movie!

 Kill Bill vol 1.....Tarantino's back!

 The best revenge story

 A seemingly miraculous feat of technical and conceptual innovation.

 GENIUS!

 In a nutshell, the best movie I've seen in 5 years (****)
