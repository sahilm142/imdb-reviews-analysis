 Two shows in one.

 Awesome

 Amy Poehler's Great!

 Better & Worse than the Office at the Same Time

 Amy Poehler need(ed) a committee to improve the script (but not anymore)

 Don't compare to "The Office"

 Not perfect, but certainly worth watching

 A close second

 A team of misfits solve problems within the Parks and Rec department of a town in Illinois

 Totally boring trash

 Great show, hopefully it continues

 Stick with it!

 Great band of characters

 Terrible

 Out of the park
