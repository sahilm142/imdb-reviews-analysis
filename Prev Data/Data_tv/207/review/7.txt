Please don't get me wrong. Please don't be offended but I am getting really really really bored with Trevor Noah.My girl-friend who is Asian remarked the other day 'why is he always talking about racism?'.I noticed the same. Every single episode racism must be addressed, and he has so many afro American guests that I start to believe the daily show has become a anti-racism platform. Which I applaud, but don't really want from a comedy show.I understand that racism is a big issue in the USA, and I am appalled by the war on drugs and imprisonment by millions. Thank Bill for that. And police shootings, yes they are horrible and horrendous. And yes, black lives matter. All life matters. Where I come from it is a novelty-discussion. In Holland we have national debates on black Pete, because we have no other real problems.Dear Trevor and writers, knowing you will never read this, I would like to point out that if you continue to go on, and on, and on about racism then you de-sensitize people on the subject. You can have too much focus on it, when over-kill happens people start to loose interest. When people are bombarded with one topic, like Trump for instance, people start to loose interest. Perhaps you have this President because you collectively shame white people, day in day out that they have gone from reasonable and concerned to annoyed.
