 12 Years Asleep

 Plodding waste of excellent actors.

 Dreadful

 The Ancient Art Of....Staring?

 Tell a 2 hour story in 20 words

 Vastly disappointing

 Just because you have an emotional story line does not give license to be shallow

 Roll out the same old barrel......

 Read a real history book instead of this BS propaganda

 Not a very good movie

 A biased, politically motivated movie that pretends to be historically accurate

 Stupidest movie I've seen in a long time..

 Empty, yet dreadful and sadistic

 12 years as a slav

 Very Heavy a Really Downlifting Feed Bad Movie

 A totally flat and pedestrian directorial exercise

 Zzzzzzzzz

 2 hours and 10 minutes a slave

 its amazing

 Shocking

 Not just bad but criminally inaccurate

 Emotional Blackmail

 The Passion of Platt

 Could This Be a Worse Movie?

 12 Minutes Of Bored To Death
