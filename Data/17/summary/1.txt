 Trash. Utter trash.

 Overrated, glamorises violence and crime

 Ugly Movie

 Most grossly overrated movie ever

 After about 40 minutes we turned it off

 Sick of over-the-top "Cool Gangster" movies? Me too.

 Most overrated movie ever!

 useless

 Most overrated film in cinema history

 Predictable story of an average gangster

 Another pathetic film from Scorsese...

 Completely Pointless - This is way overrated

 Too Long

 Major Disappointment

 this movie was the most horrible picture ever!!!

 Great Movie, But Pretty Overrated.

 Disgusting!

 No redeeming value.

 If you think about it
