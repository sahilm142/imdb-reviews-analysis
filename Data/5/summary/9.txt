 Simple but great.

 Good script, great dialogs and a set of actors who would be the envy of the world

 A timeless film that shows the flaws in the jury system

 Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?

 So Simple, So Brilliant

 Great Classic

 Unlikely, but it is possible.

 Captivates even after half a century

 Unsurpassed Character Study & Very Good Drama

 Is this the perfect low budget cinema for students to learn from?
