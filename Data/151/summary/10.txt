 Imagine yourself as a 5 year old child discovering for the first time a brand new world exists outside of your room

 This one is gonna stick with me

 A brilliant movie, but painful to watch

 Infinitely deep, an experience I will not forget.

 A non-traditional thriller with another brilliant turn from Brie Larson but an even better one from Jacob Tremblay.

 The best film I've seen in years: indescribable!

 Beautiful, moving, intense

 (Insert Expletive Here).... Perfect!!!!!

 Truly Spectacular and Unmissable!

 Ultimate Tear Jerker !!

 Amazing view of childhood

 Spellbinding Masterpiece

 Perfection still exists

 Room is an amazing film analyzing the life of a kidnapped mother and son

 Emotionally moving filmmaking.

 One of the best movies ever
