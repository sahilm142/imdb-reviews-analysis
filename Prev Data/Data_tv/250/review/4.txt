I saw the entire first season and was fairly disappointed in the end. The story line doesn't develop in a pace and unified direction. Too many distractions and no thread to pull the plot thru the end. There are a couple of main underlying lines but the they don't develop coherently and lacks focus.
Other than that I love the meticulous decor, wardrobe and sets. The acting is also very good. 
Its just not my taste in the end. No enough intrigue and mystery. lot of porn and edgy life styles in the 20's. One more thing, i don't know much about the 20's music, but I would bet the portrayal of music and dance in the night clubs are too strange and out of place for the period. it more felt like a David Lynch movie than historically accurate.
