Im not that much into Anime but this one got my attention!


                
This is coming from a non-anime fan. I've only seen one anime before in my life, I usually don't like them, and it took a lot of convincing to get me to try this.All that I said, I found the show to be extremely engaging. I didn't expect much from the plot - hearing the summery made it sound like something where they came up with the action scenes first and the story second - but it was definitely good enough to keep me interested. The characterization decreases massively the further you get from the main characters, but the protagonists are likable enough.Animation-wise, the show seems to spend every possible bit of its budget on the action scenes and save very little for the rest, and it shows. All the action scenes are animated beautifully and the motion has an excellent sense of freedom about it. In the dialogue scenes there are some pretty glaring budget cuts, like reusing animations or a great many scenes that are just various flashes of still poses rather than any motion. Still, it's not a deal-breaker.The pacing is excellent in the beginning of the show but grinds to a halt somewhere around episode 8. There are cases where 2-3 episodes could EASILY be collapsed into one. The show dangles enough hanging plot threads in front of your nose to keep you interested, but it becomes obvious later in the series that a lot of the episodes can be summarized in the little preview blurb from the previous episode.The music is most prominent during the action scenes, and that's where it's at it's best. I'm a sucker for grand orchestral and band pieces so I really enjoyed this aspect.The presentation of the monsters is a touch inconsistent but is ultimately pulled off well. All variants of these "titans" are bizarrely proportioned in one way or another, and it gives them a good sense of alien creepiness. A few in particular have a good "nightmare fuel" edge to them, including all three named titans and the one from the end of episode 1. However, while there are many scenes that portray the titans as vicious monsters there are also a few that portray them as rather dopey, and there are many, particularly the abnormals, that you can't help but laugh at.The story has that anime problem of dumping mountains of dialogue on you. It contributes to the previously mentioned pacing problem in many places. Without spoiling anything, there's an episode near the middle that... well, you know Ben Croshaw? What he said was rather relevant: "Guy pulls a gun at the beginning of an episode, fires it at the end, and everything in between was angst! I wouldn't mind, but he missed!". It wasn't exactly a gun and he didn't exactly miss, but the point is that all the angsty drama and words, words, words get in the way of the story's better bits.Overall, while I focused on the flaws a lot here, there is a lot this show does right. The world is consistently very engaging and keeps me wanting to find out what happens next. For people like me skeptical about anime in general, I say it's worth it.Oh, and Armin is apparently a guy. This took me a few episodes to figure out.


                
Possibly the most hyped anime of this year, Attack on Titan has attracted a ton of fans in its 25 episode run. And sad to say, I'm not one of them. I REALLY wanted to like this show, but It just didn't do it for me. I gave it a 5 at best.The setting and premise of the series is actually interesting, humans are basically held prisoner by the titans, giant humanoid creatures that eat humans. So the humans build walls outside of their cites to keep the titans away. That's interesting!But the show itself is a mixed bag, besides the animation and fight scenes, there's nothing really that special about this show.The pacing of the show in the beginning is not terrific, but it's okay. However that changes near halfway through the show, it becomes bad. Either an entire episode goes by and nothing eventful happens or two episodes can easily be made into one.Another major problem of the series is: Exposition. It really feels like most of the episodes are just made up of it. It truly gets in the way of character development and action.Speaking of characters, that's another thing: They're just... okay, they're really not that interesting. I could find characters like these in any other anime, or any regular show for that matter. They're average at best. The only characters I actually kind of liked were Mikasa, Levi, and I guess Armin as well. But heck, most of these characters aren't really developed at all, some of them may have a *breif* mention of their past. But other than that, ****SPOILERS**** a lot of these characters were just created to die, nothing more. It would be nice to actually know the characters and try to see them grow and try to reach their goal, whatever it may be, but we never see that. So when a character dies, I DON'T CARE, because I never grew to like or know him/her.****END SPOILERS**** Another thing about this show is that it tries WAY too hard to be shocking. There's times where that's not necessarily a bad thing, but here it's annoying. A good example of a show with good shocking scenes is Neon Genesis Evangelion. ****Evangelion SPOILERS**** There, we are introduced to a setting and characters we're familiar and comfortable with, then halfway through the show, that setting and familiar feeling is destroyed episode by episode, with scenes of gore and psychological terror, stuff we wouldn't see in the early episodes, and we soon become uncomfortable. And that setting ceases to exist by the infamous The End of Evangelion movie****End Evangelion SPOILERS**** In Attack on Titan, we're always used to the gore and terror, and no matter how many limbs or how much blood is thrown at me, I won't be surprised or shocked on what happens. And there's only so many times I can handle seeing everyone cower or screaming in fear, that gets REALLY old quickly. Heck, some of the shocking scenes actually become sort of laughable because it's so over the top. (at least for me)The action is good, but surprisingly limited. Again, because of exposition. It seems like that's a trend this show likes to make, avoiding action scenes and actual character development and favoring exposition instead.It's kinda sad too, this show had some real potential to be a classic, but in the end, the writers and creative team kept making the wrong choices. I've never read the original manga, but that has to be better than this show.So yeah, the countless praise and acclaim from fans just doesn't make any sense to me. I'm sorry, but Attack on Titan is just overrated. And I'm not saying that to "troll" or make anyone mad, that's how I honestly feel. This show seemed exciting in the trailers and clips I watched, but there's really nothing groundbreaking or special about it, and it's not a show I recommend.You want good anime from this year? Watch Kill la Kill or Free!You want a good, dark, mature, anime with good characters and character development? Watch Cowboy Bebop, Neon Genesis Evangelion or Fullmetal Alchemist (the original 2003 series)
I was a while since I watched an anime this good. The feeling of absolute helplessness it gave me when watching the titans rip apart was frightening in a good way. As soon as I watched all the anime episodes I had to go and read the manga and like I thought there is plenty of good stuff yet to come. Mikasa is one of the best characters if not the best, except for her obsession with Eren. I guess that's part of her strength or even the very reason she is so strong. On the other hand Eren is very... passionate and essential to the story because of his Titan power but even though he starts well, I'm not particularly pleased with his character development. Armin is a good strategist and he's growing fast and becoming an important asset to the "team".
I finally got to watch this properly and honestly, I effing love the theme song! I'm a lot more obsessed with this season's theme song then the other 2 seasons after it. I even love the characters as well, I think Levi,Eren, Mikasa and Hange are one of the best likeable characters in this anime that I've ever come across! Glad I got a chance to see this anime, 8/10 i give it!
They just put too much time in character development, so much that it becomes repulsive


                
I originally watched the first season almost back to back on DVD, it has great action and good character development and the concept was unique enough to hold my interest.but something I hadn't realised when watching the show back to back like that sort of hit me when watching seasons 2.This show is so slow!!! it feels like they manage to put out 15+ minutes of drama for every minute of action but that isn't bad, things need a good mix but what really slows things down are the cliffhangers.literally every episode is slow slow slow ow ow ow what's this ?!!? wow is this really going to happen? *Roll credits* ¬_¬ yep they did it again another cliff hanger.the next episode usually quickly wraps up the cliffhanger by either concluding it quickly then moving onto the next thing or avoids it until the end of the episode by going into some "x hours earlier" for 80% of the episode.It is still an enjoyable show just don't watch it one episode a week as the bad pacing can easily create frustration at the show and how slow it can be at times.get it binge the whole thing back to back and not have to wait for answers to those end of episode cliff hangers and you probably wont be disappointed.


                
ATTACK ON TITAN aka shingeki no kyogin is a shonen anime series which is directed by tetsuro araki but also published as a manga back in 2009 by hajaime isyama the art style is amazing and has one of the best soundtracks you'll ever hear since BERSERK or NEON GENESIS EVANGELION it has a hans zimmer styled music which is like inception and the dark knight the characters are interesting and have many backstories especially levi's in the no regret ova *original video animation* more are coming this year which focuses on annie leonhardt's origins there will possibly be more not sure if they'll make one about kenny ackerman the titans themselves are scary as hell when i first saw them they act like mindless zombies but they're naked and eat humans some of them are very small and some are big right now there are 2 seasons of the anime i have seen the first season when it came out in 2013 but i watched it in 2014 i'd still highly recommend it to anyone who want to watch it the action scenes are the best you'll ever see they use weapons called the 3dmg (third dimensional maneuver gear or also called omni directional mobility gear) which allows them to hookshot anything concrete or wood think of spiderman but without the web slingers the titans are killed by slicing their back neck it is required to use two swords to slice them fully
this is my first review for an anime i've been a fan of since 2014 can't wait till season 3 comes out in 2018
Being someone who actually kind of liked the live action movies, it was simply impossible for me not to like the actual thing. One thing that Attack on Titan has it going for it is the whole mythology behind the main plot. There is a huge base of information layered down so that the actual story to flourish. Plus, the action scenes are enough to keep it interesting till the very ending. Another plus was the fact that some episodes could keep you at the edge of your seat, like when that female titan appeared. You just want to keep watching. To both of them, the soundtrack helped a lot, especially the opening theme, building up the mood for something epic. Finally, the characters were really likable and you couldn't help but sympathise with all of them. And now the negative points. Season one had some boring episodes, but fortunately, season two had just some boring parts here and there. However, season two had less episodes with the main characters, which was kind of annoying. You want to see Eren more than just a few seconds in an episode. But that's just me. Also, the art kind of didn't settle with me. Mikasa looked like the male characters, only with the addition of long hair. But, in the action scenes they did a great job, so at least that worked. Also, the titans got worse in season two, weirder in a way, but that could have been just a story thing. So, overall, 8 out of 10.
This is not one of the shows that are filled with mystery, intrigue and a complex plot. It does not come anywhere close to the anime masterpieces like Neon Genesis Evangelion in any aspect. However, if it's fast paced action that you crave, this is the show for you.I won't spoil much of the plot here. The basic premise is about a bunch of teenagers fighting for survival against huge humanoid monsters in a post-apocalyptic setting. The main characters are well fleshed out. There is plenty of gore, and the show does not shy away from killing off major characters on a whim.The production values are marvelous, and the quality animation makes it a feast for the eyes.The opening themes are catchy and among the better ones in anime.This is the only anime series apart from Death Note that made futile all my attempts to resist watching one episode after the other.In conclusion, this is a show best watched on a marathon session on a lazy weekend.


                
Overall, the anime and the manga combined are just plain awesome. The characters aren't just your cliché badasses with no emotions, they actually have human emotions with tragic backstories. Attack on Titan has made it laugh, its made me cry, its excited me and shocked me at the same time. Hell, even the villains have human emotions. For example, after Mikasa and Levi get Eren back from the Female Titan (AKA Annie), you can see her crying out of realization of the people she killed.Again, overall this show and manga put me through a variety of emotions ranging from shock, heartbreak and happiness.Though the dialogue to me was a bit dramatic and more than I would like it. Characters can spend a whole episode doing nothing but talking with no new action or information.
This show has a lot going for it.Firstly the animation and art are fantastic and some of the best I've seen.The characters motivations are quite realistic and the drama is always present which it should be especially since this is the show about giants eating naked people.Getting onto the characters(early light spoiler warning) Eren is revenge fuelled after the Titans destroy his life.Mikasa his adopted sister is fuelled by the motivation to protect him.Armin just wants to accompany his friends.The show also mildly touches on the topic of irrational religious beliefs as well as having to lose your humanity to cope with horrible predicaments(the latter I feel is hammered a bit too much).Thoughthere are problems I have even with the first arc.Firstly the cast is very large so there are multiple deaths.The problem is I haven't had enough time to care about them.Thats okay as long as the deaths are simply used to make the audience afraid and add a sense of true danger but they linger on the deaths far too long.Example(fair spoilers by the way)a certain character called Marco dies and he wasn't memorable in the least and when they linger on him for so long I'm left wondering why.Then is the role of Mikasa who is unbelievably overpowered not just to the point where she is stronger than everyone else but to the point where she's only in danger at two points in the series.Then is the Female Titan arc which has unbelievably wonky storytelling.(Major Spoilers)While it mantains the mood and emotion the main antagonist the female Titan has been shown to be capable of being defeated by the team captain Levi yet insists on not doing so because God knows why.Not to mention they have multiple chances to kill the Titan but they monologue whilst it thinks of ways to escape.Because of all this I give AOT an 8/10 and despite the problems a recommendation to watch it ~heywhatsupguysitsscarcehere
I watched attack on titan recently and i have to admit it is really good. The concept behind the show is great and it has a really strong start. It is definitely an emotional show, as most of the plot involves situations where the characters have to face great challenges and sometimes die. The characters are straight forward and the worst part of the show. Mikasa is a straight forward badass that shows little to no emotion, Armin is actually pretty interesting as he struggles with his fear of titans, but Eren is really boring and stereotypical.I also don't like the existence of titan shifters. I liked the vibe of the first episodes and a battle star galactica inspired story in the last arc kinda made the show worseDespite its flaws, i like and recommend this show, but don't expect the best anime ever
OK, so just finished the first season and I gotta say: IT IS AWESOME!! I don't know exactly what has to be so especial, but it kept me so interested , and I don't even like standard action animes. first thoughts: I have to say thought the first episode didn't really get me enthusiastic about this show, but i just kept watching because the hype was so much, haven't regret, as the story moves it just keeps the viewer more connected with the fantasy.about the story: schemes get more complex as the show goes, and it is impossible not to get curious about what is going to happen(I watched the whole first season in two days, couldn't get me eyes of the show)things that lack: in my opinion the show lacks on constructing the relationships between the main characters and the secondary characters, i just think it should built i more dense relationship. As a girl I miss a little of romance.


                
I wanted to write this review for quite awhile. I wanted to show the world why I really liked AOT and, quite frankly, I was bored as balls. After Chapter 57 of AOT comic book was released and the revelation that only the Japanese version was out, I didn't have any clue what to do other than to write a review on AOT. So, without further rambling, here's my written review.Attack on Titan is an anime, made by Hajime Isayama, about these really big humanoid creatures called Titans, who appear out of nowhere a 100 years ago, and starts terrorizing the world, nearly wiping out humanity from the face of the map. Then the human survivors were all like: Human Survivor #1:"Hey, lets make a giant wall so that we can protect ourselves from those nasty Titans." Human Survivor #2:"Ok!!!" So they create 3 gigantic walls(Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina), where they hide in peace and tranquility for about a hundred years.... until an even bigger Titan kicks down part of the wall, letting the Titans come in to play with mankind and killing like 1/3 of humanity in the wall.The first thing that I will praise about this show is the atmosphere of the setting. It gives you this sense of sorrow, horror, and especially hopelessness in the type of environment the people live in, constantly being reminded that they can't go outside for a change because Titans are blocking the gateway to their freedom. I'll also praise the story. I thought it was going to be another one of those generic post-apocalyptic genre's that has been rehashed over and over again. But the story goes so much deeper than that, going into subjects like hope and heroism, the government, morality, dreams and reality, etc. The story is my favorite part of the series, personally.I'm also impress with the animation. The series is actually using a new production, and I was really surprised by the amount of quality the anime had with it's art work. Especially with the fight scene's and stuff. Those are OP.Then there are the character's. The 3 main protagonists are Eren Jaeger, 15 yr old kid who saw his mom die by a Titan and now has anger issues; Mikasa Ackerman, 15 year old girl who shows no emotions what-so-ever and constantly wants to be at Eren's side; and Armin Alert(he he, Alert), 15 year old boy(?) who is a weakling at the beginning of the story and always has to be rescued by Eren and Mikasa.Quite frankly.... I didn't like them a lot. They were as interesting as Shake It Up, which isn't interesting. I didn't like Eren because he was angry all the freaking time. I know he wants to avenge his mom and stuff, but can he calm down for like 5 minutes? he asks like he is on his period. I don't like Mikasa because of her clinging behavior to Eren and stoic expression. I liked Armin though. Even though he was portrayed as being scared all the time, he go character development and became brave slightly.And another thing: Character Development. You want find any of those there in the show, besides Armin and Jean, a supporting character.Verdict: I like it a lot and I would recommend it to anime and TV watchers.
I'll admit that I wasn't going to check this show out to begin with. I had been disillusioned with Anime for a good period of time since the early 2010s; I didn't have anything against it but for a while it was all starting to seem the same to me. I guess years of being into Anime can do that to you plus the massive amount of shows you check out. So even the cool costumes I was seeing at conventions weren't enough to persuade me to check the show out, and even the sparkly text and histrionics about this supposedly being the "Game of Thrones" of anime could. But a week ago or so, my resistance finally reached a breaking point and I found myself on Netflix scrolling for twenty minutes straight looking for something to watch. After several minutes straight of trying to resist its pretty looking poster, I gave up and began watching it. And to my surprise, my low expectations were immediately exceeded with its gripping opening scene and I had gotten up to 8 episodes that night before heading to bed, finishing the show two days later I'll get the bad things about this show out of the way first, because there are quite a few of them: For one, the pacing is incredibly slow. I realize this isn't anything new in anime and DBZ had been the king of slow pacing, and thankfully it isn't a bother most of the time, but there are moments when its anime-ness begin to shine through- extended imagine spots and entire conversations did get rather frustrating. There are a few episodes that do rely on the characters not knowing what's on the outside of the wall, to the point where it causes the characters to act stupid at times. But then there is also the subplot where Eren becomes a Titan after being swallowed by one, and with a simple gnaw on his hand, can become a titan at will. There are a few situations that could be solved by him becoming a Titan, but he doesn't. In some situations it's effect but in others it's frustrating. And lastly the ending is a bit of a cop-out. I know it had to happen but even still it was somewhat unsatisfying But like any patient viewer I didn't let these spoil the show and just sat back and appreciated it for what it was: a stunning piece of storytelling and visual mastery. For all its flaws, there were enough high points to dull them; be it some rather unexpected twists in the stories or even just the few moments where you can just sit and appreciate the visual beauty. In addition, the action scenes are truly fantastic and well done; it's been ages since there have been action sequences this exciting in anime. It's always a joy watching the gas tanks shoot steam and watching the characters fly at full force of one of the titans to attack it. And the characters; the first time I've felt any attachment of any kind to the characters. Part of them is that none of them are written to be perfect and all have their flaws; there's a sense of moral ambiguity in each and every piece of character development. It was always interesting watching Eren try to balance out the power of being able to become a titan at will and the responsibility that should be exercised; for a major plot point spent on a female titan, he is faced with the choice of becoming a titan killing the other titan, or letting his friends fight. Of course, he realizes the hard way that both decisions have consequences- it's the moments like this that make Attack on Titan a wholly satisfying experience Attack on Titan is flawed no doubt, but bear with it- watching it is a truly rewarding experience. Sure, go for the badass costumes and epic action sequences, but stay for the grand scale storytelling and the visual brilliance. Even despite the flaws, it's clear that Attack On Titan's creators have poured nothing but love into it. It's fun to watch and is very interesting, but it also has parallels to Japanese war history and even throws some unexpected curveballs as a nice bonus. While I'm not sure my enjoyment is enough to have gotten me back into anime as a whole (though that "Knights of Sidonia" show does look awesome), I can say that you can count me as a supporter and a fan and while it is a shame we have to wait for a year to see the next season, I'm excited to see where this show goes next
Shingeki no Kyojin is a great anime , very unique in its type , which can be described as a fantasy / heroic , although there is no lack of gender elements of war / strategy. Curious about the progress of the story , which takes place through various "pieces" of several episodes interspersed with periods that can last for years. Interesting are the (many) characters, with a great a large variety of different personalities. Best part of the anime are human emotions with which the characters are almost forced to confront often finding themselves in extreme conditions and for this, the emotions are much more accurate. Finally, I would recommend it to anyone , really nice work. 8/10
