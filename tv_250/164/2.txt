After watching the series for a short time I had to stop, Folks this isn't How Joan Crawford and Bette Davis acted to each other at all. Robert Aldrich, the Producer of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? said the so called feud was made up largely for publicity as they thought it would bring in more movie patrons. The true reason is simply this Joan and Bette were at a Hollywood gathering in the early thirties and Joan was already established at MGM and Bette was new at Warner Bros. and was struggling. Bette felt Joan didn't spend enough time with her and snubbed her. In addition, Bette starred in Dangerous with Franchot Tone and fell in love with him, shortly afterward Joan married Tone and this brought Bette's wrath. Aldrich would later comment "Ms. Davis and Crawford acted Professionally on set at all times. This series is a fictional account and gives no credit to two Hollywood Legends.


                
The majority of these reviews were written after viewing one episode of Feud. I also enjoyed the first episode. However, halfway through the second episode I found myself bored and tired of people - all the characters - having some sort of argument with whoever was with them. The producer, the director, the stars, the spouse. All of them raging at each other. I came to realize that this was what the whole series is going to be about, and after watching nearly the entire episode, I turned it off and also deleted my DVR designation to record all episodes. Here is the whole story: Bette Davis and Joan Crawford hated each other and were miserable women at the stage of their lives that this story took place. The end. Who wants to watch two old women arguing and acting tough? Not me. What a disappointment; I wonder whose fault it is that this is such a mess.
