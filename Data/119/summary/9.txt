 A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Truly Unforgettable

 Eastwood is poacher turned gamekeeper, a reformed gunfighter who takes up the cause of a wronged prostitute...

 A Great, Great Film

 Video Meliora Proboque, Deteriora Sequor

 both sides of the gun

 Had my socks knocked off by this movie today.

 A gritty uncompromising view of life in a moral vacuum

 The western,the way it ought to be presented.

 One of the greatest movies and highly re-watchable

 If u don't watch this movie then u are- UNFORGIVEN

 Notoriously Vicious And Intemperate Disposition

 Did it deserve the Best Picture Oscar?! Probably not--but it still is a very dandy picture!

 The antithesis of Eastwood's iconic career is sombre, reflexive, challenging and utterly accomplished.

 This is a shining example of Eastwood's abilities as a filmmaker.

 A winner from director/actor Clint Eastwood

 American Myth: The Western

 Reflective, contemplative revenge western is a real treat

 Who is Unforgiven ?

 A story with a clear look into the human heart....
