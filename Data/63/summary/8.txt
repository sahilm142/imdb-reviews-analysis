 Pixar Hits a Home Run with Wall-E...They Just Didn't Hit It Out of the Park!

 visually astonishing but somewhat lacking in drama

 Wall-E is A-dorable

 Brilliant beginning somewhat spoiled by the reality it alludes to

 One of the best of the year!

 Funny and engaging, but foggy in the second half
