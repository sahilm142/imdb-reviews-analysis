 Well Executed, Good Movie But Not Impressed...

 Visually entertaining

 I wouldn't call it top 250 worthy, but it certainly does the job as a cute, family orientated movie.

 Hercules

 "Dragon" breathes a lot of smoke, but doesn't catch fire

 "We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard."

 Sweet, fun movie

 How About a Komodo?

 Not as good as the ratings would indicate

 I felt something wonderful while watching this movie.

 Great fun even without the kids

 A new title to the collection

 Good entertainment

 Good for what it is, but certainly not top 250 material

 cool dragons, I'm sure kids would love it

 A Fireball Allegory with Heart

 A cute, thrilling and occasionally humorous film with a lovable dragon, Toothless

 I I simply loved this movie, despite the cheesy looking dragons.

 Watching the flight sequences was awesome

 Gives you that Pixar feeling.

 Great message from an entertaining tale

 a good example of a formulaic family picture

 Good but not great family adventure movie; many boring parts, and almost has a good female role model but doesn't

 Trained Very Well...

 Pretty good.
