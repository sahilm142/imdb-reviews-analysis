Korean films are coarse and over-realistic. This film is not an exception either.  This is not the best Korean film by any means.  This is only a well-made crime drama... not a penny less not a penny more.
I watched a Korean sci-fi thriller comic movie (unfortunately can't remember its English title) earlier this year.  It was the best sci-fi thriller ever.
