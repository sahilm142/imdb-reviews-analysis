M is uninvolving and amateurish. Merely on the outside, looking in.Given the subject matter, it's understandable to not delve into it, but just makes for a bad film. Started out fine, but then became nothingness. Lots of filler, trying to find him in a building, when three of them could of just grabbed him in the fist place instead of following him. Lorre's acting talent underutilized for the most part. Then to have a pointless trial, which makes no sense for the characters to do. Just for Lorre's character to explain, he can't do anything about it.
