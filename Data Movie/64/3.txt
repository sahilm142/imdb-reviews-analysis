This anime had great potential, and I can say that the first half was exciting, with a full story. However...***SPOILERS***It all gets worse as you grow to dislike the protagonist for helping to save the humans when he should have fully sided with the forest. Because of his desperation to help both sides, the humans manage to destroy the spirit of the forest.The ending is terrible, because even though the forest spirit is killed, Ashitaka says 'Never. He's life itself" which is untrue, as it was a physical form before, so clearly not the same. And worse, he says he's going to help rebuild Iron Town which was the cause of the destruction in the first place. The ending leaves you feeling angry, that the 'Magic' has gone from the world (all the gods are killed), leaving a world not unlike our own.... and an uncertain future for San and Ashitaka, both going to separate places.Great potential, but an ultimately unsatisfying film.
After all of the raving I heard about this I was expecting a lot more. The characters weren't interesting and none of them made me care about them. The character development was weak.It seems to me that drama is hard to do with animation because they can't do as much with the facial expressions.  Perhaps it's too difficult to be subtle with animation (or anime).The story was only mildly interesting.  It didn't have any epic qualities about it.  The animation may have been great but these days with computers helping them it's hard to be impressed by mere glitz.The scene near the end with the forest spirit turning into a headless monster gave me the feeling I was watching an animated variation on the Godzilla theme.Very run-of-the-mill overall I'd say.
