 Bored and More Bored

 Game of Moans :(

 Blood Splattered Soft Porn Set in the Middle Ages

 Not a flattering reflection of the book!

 Nudity and Gore

 Violent Porn is no Substitute for Creativity

 A Tasteless, Boring Mess!!!

 Over-hyped nonsense

 Too much violence and gore scenes...blood all over the brainless characters

 You used to be cool, man

 A sad two :(

 Way too overrated! Not any good for a true fan of the books :(

 A disgusting abomination.

 Get your barf bags, folks!

 Overrated snooze fest

 Oh dear!

 Series 7 opener

 Takes the Throne of Crapiness

 Goodbye, overrated creation!

 Embarrassingly terrible

 Boring boring

 Production is awesome, story is lacking

 Boooooooooring

 Leaves me wanting

 Great BUT!
