 "a good-looking creation albeit not much else"

 Jackson vs. Tolkien 0-2

 Peter, what have you done!?

 The Two hours too much (DVD)

 The quest to destroy the One Ring continues.

 Can we have some humour please

 Fellowship was good. Two Towers was not good.

 Didn't enjoy it

 Too much clanging!

 Great movie IF you do not know the book

 Good special effects but little plot, longggg

 4/10 The WORST film of 2002

 Nasty hobbit

 Are you people nuts? what's with the 9.1 average rating? Not a good movie at all!

 Don't bother if you're not a fan of the books

 a highly overrated bloated battle film

 play that emboldening theme song one more time...

 Nothing Happens

 Decent movie, read the book first

 Translation is not an excuse for a movie filled with cliché

 Lord of the Boring Moments, Worst Film Ever Made

 A movie for blind-fans only...

 A unsatisfying mess.(minor spoilers)

 Not as good as the first one

 First one was good movie but bad Lord of the Rings. This one is just bad.
