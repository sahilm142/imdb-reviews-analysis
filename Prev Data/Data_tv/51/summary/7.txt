 Surpasses the brilliant original.

 Pretty Good

 Not as bad as people who haven't seen it are saying....

 Well worth a watch

 Pretty Decent Show

 Good, not great...

 Not as painful as the original

 Unusual type of comedy

 really good show

 Seasons1-4 are Golden and deserve 8+ rating but then the down fall...

 One line

 To assume is to make an ass out of u and me.

 Several story lines can take place!

 Not bad

 It rocks

 I miss Steve Carell, we all miss Steve Carell

 greatest show since seinfeld.

 A Screwy Portrait of Modern Reality

 Good US interpretation of the British "The Office"

 A pale copy at first, but now it's really got a life of its own.

 I am English and yet I would have a hard time choosing between this and the UK Office.

 Like both but original better...

 depth kills (sometimes)

 Great comedy but exhausting to watch

 Decent
