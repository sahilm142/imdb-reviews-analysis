 Landscape of Arabia

 A good film, for those who like the type

 I know it's a classic and it's easy to see why but here's why it isn't perfect

 unconventional imperialists

 Memorable Visuals, Sound & Acting, Yet It Peters Out

 Visual Grandeur

 Finally a classic worth watching

 A long epic... unlike this review

 My love of movies began here

 Runs out of steam in the 2nd half as the main character gets simplified

 One of the most carefully made and interesting movies of all times

 Stunning in so many ways, grand and intimate and surprising!

 A Memorable, Expertly-Crafted Epic

 Simply a great film!

 Epic in every way

 A saga of epic proportions..

 Epic (role)

 "I pray that I will never see the desert again!"

 Classic about a man, consumed by the desert...

 Very bad

 They don't make them like this anymore

 Epic. Really really epic.

 Slows Down.

 All male movie

 An outstanding achievement - but not for modern viewers
