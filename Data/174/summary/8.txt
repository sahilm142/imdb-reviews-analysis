 Cool Hand Luke

 Newman Perfectly Cast as an Anti-Establishment Hero

 "A Natural Born World-Shaker"

 The emperor of the losers...

 cool enough look

 Enjoyable but the end was a bit of a letdown...

 Seen a few times, very good movie...

 A true classic!

 "What we've got here is failure to communicate."
