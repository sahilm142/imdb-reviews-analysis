I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that "Avengers: Infinity War" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who "died" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: "Avengers: Infinity War" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.
Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.
1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.
1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say "You guys are so screwed now!". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).
Before I bought the tickets for this, I was amazed, to say the least, by the high ratings at this site. Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical "good vs. evil" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an "apocalyptic" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some "plot holes" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers


                
Obviously, the movie did not meet expectations. This film which is expected for a long time does not show anything new to us. I do not see anything new in this film.
Obviously, I did not find the reason for what they did, very realistic. I would like to narrow down your expectations and go to this film.


                
It was ridiculous how many times the Avengers should've taken out Thanos. When Starkiller punches Thanos when they almost had the glove off, it ruined a lot of the movie for me.There were so many poor decisions the Avengers made that demote this movie. From not destroying the stones while they had them, to seeking out Thanos separately instead of all together, these dumb decisions made this movie unrealistic given the world.It's still one of the better Marvel movies, but it could've been better had the characters behaved more rationally.
***SPOILERS AT THE BOTTOM***The good:
-The film should be commended on managing to make a watchable film that brings together characters from the previous Avengers films, both Guardians films, Black Panther and Doctor Strange. It could have been a complete mess and thankfully it wasn't.
-Thanos is possibly the best MCU villain so far, although I know that isn't saying much. He had clear motivations, conflicts, personality, you know, all the things that go into a good character. He wasn't generic bad guy #7.
-As expected the film was pretty funny. Most of the jokes landed.The bad:
-Although the film wasn't a mess, there were a fair few characters that did almost literally nothing. Kinda understandable when you have 35 or so characters but even so, it is still a negative.
-There was no single clear driving force in terms of plot. Instead we had three different groups of characters doing their own thing, and occasionally meet one of the other groups.
-Tonally it was kinda like watching two films at once, largely due to the integration of the Guardians characters with the Avengers.
-This film features a faceless CGI army for the heroes to dismember.***SPOILERS BELOW***
SPOILER: And my biggest problem with this film is the ending. Throughout the film there are three characters (should have been four!!) that die and it is very clear that they are actually dead and Marvel isn't going to bring them back. They die for a reason. At the end of the film however, probably half the characters from the entire film die. So the way I see it is that one of two things happened, and one is infinitely more likely than the other. Either a) Marvel legit killed off 15 of its characters in one scene or b) they wanted the audience to think they did so they could have a cheap cliffhanger. The problem is that if option A is correct, everyone is going to be thinking they actually went for option B! The way the scene is played is very straight, very emotional, loud music + slow motion etc so they are very clearly trying to make you care. But the problem is, regardless of whether these characters are going to remain dead, I spent the whole scene thinking that they would almost certainly all come back via Time Stone magic in the next film. Had they killed off maybe two or three primary characters then it would have been believable but you can't kill off half your franchise in a universe where the Time Stone exists and expect me to care.So overall, a mixed bag but generally positive. 6/10.
Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised. Perhaps a second viewing is needed down the line.


                
Marvel's biggest issue in my opinion is that there is just too much to take from comics, as it is a giant cluster mess. There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse. Good luck.
What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing. Positives.The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind "Winter Soldier" and "Civil War" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one.The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest. NegativesThis is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. 
The humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other??
The third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to "kill" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong)
The final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts.Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.
Infinity War is a astonishing film which serves as the culmination of everything that occurred in MCU since the first pictures. Would seem, the movie had to turn out obscure and overloaded, but screenwriters so skillfully bring one moment to another that the movie bewitches with the first until the last minute. "War" connects those who didn't know about existence of each other, divides the teams which developed in the past, transfers characters from one region of the Galaxy in another, accompanying everything with grandiose battles. At the same time the narration remains clear and fascinating. Of course, if you've watched the previous movies. It's not a movie for those who want to get acquainted with Captain America, Thor, Hulk and other famous characters. The film is shot for fans, and the better you know the MCU story, the you derive bigger pleasure from viewing.


                
This was the movie we were expecting for a long long time and while Thanos is the best Marvel villain i got a feeling the movie was a little crowded with all the main characters. Sure, they do need to include everyone but on the other hand we never see them all together and the movies gives a vibe of being rushed around from one place to the other and you constantly need to be focused on what is going on. I love all the characters and actors are amazing performers and the story has got to be dark i do think it was a bit too dark since it does not have one positive moment and the Avengers team gets defeated on and on. Of course there is a sequel coming out but i do think a few positive moments would have been good. I loved all the performances and cgi is amazing so overall a positive experience.


                
Don't come into this film expecting a masterpiece of grand proportions. The films action was above the standard for marvel movies, but the film tries to handle many plot lines at once and struggles to move much.It didn't feel like a complete movie, while I understand that it is meant to establish the next Avengers (which goes unnamed), but the entire movie didn't have a payoff, it was a movie of setting up.It was alright, but failed to meet the expectations it set of a "cinematic experience of a lifetime".


                
Sorry folks, but I'm not one of those people who goes, "Yaaaayyyy, WOW, Super Cool, every time there is an action sequence...me, I like a movie with a coherent plot behind it; something that characters can build on...and I'm not seeing it here...There is action sequence after action sequence, but no real why to latch onto. We have every super hero in the Marvel Universe either fighting some nondescript super villians or fighting amongst themselves...and not any solid story to follow...Oh, I understand that Kronos is suppose to be wanting to be the King of the Universe, or something like that; be let's be real here. why is there so much hooray for this movie just because it has a Marvel Intro to start it...I guess I just don't understand fanatical cults...Marvel actually pulled out the stops, engaged every super hero ever, and threw a bunch of action together to please their fans...apparently it worked from the ratings I'm seeing...
The people who are saying this is the best film of all time are wrong. This isn't Best Picture worthy, but it is a really fun film. It was epic seeing all these characters come together to fight Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, he was a great villain, definitely one of the best in the entire MCU (Loki is still better though). 
I recommend watching these movies first if you haven't seen any MCU movies yet:
The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War. 
Those movies will help you understand the story a bit better. 
So yeah, I loved this film.


                
Not a major fan of Avengers, but this is the best of the lot but there are many flaws with Infinity War, one of them is the Thanos powers are not clearly consistant. The battles happen in a here there and everywhere fashion. It sometimes feel like different movies all put together and sometimes hard to follow whos doing what and for what purpose.The battles scenes are great with exceptionally visuals and cgi but the purpose to defeat one undefeated villian is jumbled up. Infinity Wars is clearly an overated movie but deserves credit especially in the visuals and a simple plot which the movie intends to make it complex.I didnt feel the superheroes powers like we did in their stand alone movies, its like a buffet.The worst performance was The Hulk, he had absolutely no business in being there if he was not willing each time to show his powers. I expected more from Infinity Wars since the big hype and thought they could have done more fighting as united Avengers to defeat one main villain. I know this might be done deliberately so that we can spend another 2,5 hours again for the next installment.Nevertheless its still an entertaining movie that I liked but not love or drool over it like some fans, has its ups and down with top of the range visual effects. Some say that it is so sad in the end, honestly I did not feel anything for them at the end, the ending is just bad, and it might turn out diffently in the next installment.Between Black Panther and Infinity War, I would prefer Black Panther as it was more focused on the characters and story which is a better made film overall.To have a rating of 8.6 on imdb is undeserving as these are mostly fanboys superior ratings. To give where credit is due is only in the visuals and cgi and maybe in the difficulty in making such a huge movie with a huge cast that is why I give a 7 out of 10M


                
Before watching Infinity War, I was really tired of the MCU.
Besides Homecoming and GOTG, I felt like all the movies were cookie cutter garbage, including the "classics". 
However, IW made me feel excited for a franchise that was pretty much dead to me.
It took risks, which was what Marvel needed for a while.
I'm glad they decided to end the movie killing off the money makers of the franchise.
This may sound rough, but I hope most of the characters remain dead. 
Let's just hope Marvel actually learns from this movie and stop playing it safe.
The Big Bang created six stones that each govern aspects of the universe. Somebody wanna 'splain me why they aren't scattered in galaxies billions of light years apart, maybe in the cores of planets, instead of being in one small region of space where they can all be collected? So Thanos, mastermind of the previous attack on New York, has a theory that saving the universe means bringing it back within its carrying capacity by killing half the sentient life forms on every world. So he sends his minions to earth to collect the stones he's still missing. To combat them, all the various Marvel characters come together, and it is indeed great fun to see them. There's a climactic battle in Wakanda, where Thanos completes his quest and people, including some Marvel folk, begin disintegrating, presumably because Thanos can now will their disappearance. We see Thanos sitting under an alien moon, and given the reassurance that he will return. Okay, where do they go from here? Just imagine the chaos if half the human race vanishes. It'll make the "Left Behind" scenario look mild in comparison. What will Thanos do for an encore? He already has the Infinity Gauntlet. And do they fight Thanos with magic and psychic powers? No, plain old "Biff" "Pow" mechanical force. Stuff that the military does quite capably. So wouldn't a few F-35's help a little bit? Wouldn't a few gunships help with that attacking horde at Wakanda? So a lot of very fun stuff that fizzles out into yet another chaotic mass melee and a profoundly disappointing ending.
This movie is actually better than I expected but not in the top 100 movies of all time nor in the top 10 of this year.
Don't expect much or any character development in this movie. 
95% of all the characters were already introduced in previous Marvel movies.
You would have had to have seen at least ten others marvel movies to get any joy out of this movie . So this one goes straight to the action .The super heroes are in groups and they fight separate fights and the movie seems scattered . The obvious plot does not make up for it, the characters do not develop further , it often feels more like a good computer game then a movie. 
So cannot give it more than a 7 * . It is not as bad as you might expect from such a movie and the plot does get a bit more interesting, however simplistic it is... 
Super heros are no longer invincible , unfortunately many of them are still far from human . We cannot really identify with them or estimate if any of their actions actually make any sense - we are a spectators, like spectators of a video game we have never seen before..
 For example how much punishment can a super hero or super villain take before he dies, we have no idea and there is no gauge. Sometimes they just get up again other times not.. The movie does have some interesting sub plots and parts to it , yes even the villains have a human side. Nevertheless the main villains motive for wanting to destroy half the universe is unsatisfactory, at best . The good part is that it is not too predictable, the movie has good CGI and well actually good actors in most of the roles.


                
This film was not at all what I expected or hoped for out of Infinity War. By no means was it a bad film or undeserving of praise, but there were details that could have been executed better. The plot, though it came with a few surprises, was ultimately rather repetitive and could have taken place in a much shorter span, leaving time for more character development (which was lacking) and a chance for our mightiest heroes to truly team together and fight Thanos-what I think we were all expecting out of this culmination of ten years of the MCU. Additionally, it isn't much of a cliffhanger if every we know that the majority of the characters who "died" are coming back for later films, and it only saves us temporary grief. Although this is personal preference, it could also have been darker. I love humor as much as the next film-goer, but at some point there has to be a line. As previously stated, this is the culmination of ten years' worth of films building up to this moment, and I spent most of it laughing rather than crying, as did many of my companions.
None of this is to say it was a bad film. It was much-anticipated, and there were moments that broke my heart. I was on the edge of my seat for a good portion of those two-and-a-half hours, and for good reason. The scoring brought tears to my eyes more than once. It was a good film. But I expected more from Marvel.
I thought this movie was good but not great like people were telling me. Spoiler - I kept thinking the entire time this was going to end up like Breaking Dawn Part 2 and everyone was going to be ok. Boy was I wrong. Spoiler - I mean they made these stones so dang powerful with Thanos using them, why couldn't the Avengers have just pulled the power together in the stones that they had and killed Thanos. I am looking forward to the ending when Thanos gets his. I still can't believe I actually paid to watch this.
"Avengers: Infinity War" (2018) is a professionally produced action adventure film about The Avengers and their eventual allies coming together to stop the growing powers of Thanos, played by Josh Brolin. I must admit I felt different from the beginning of the film to the end. I will sum it up by saying, it was joyful to see so many of my favorite characters come together until the end and leave it at that. It is difficult to really dive into what this film is about without being repetitive of prior super hero movies or completely giving the film away. However, staying in tradition of a Marvel super hero film, it is a fresh take that hits most of the normal marks excluding the conclusion.The acting of this star-studded film, as expected is, dead on marvelous. It's not overly hokey like some of the hero films tend to be. The Russo brothers also did an immaculate job in directing this film. The fight scenes were very vivid and gripping in every sequence. In contrast, I do believe this film may have been a little long for my taste. I really think if the script would have been slimmed down to focus on Thanos' search for the stones and the Avengers and allies trying to stop him, there wouldn't be so many moments that feel like they drag on. I also believe there should have been some type of "actual" call to action for the Avengers in the end. I know there is a proposed continuation, but it feels like a lazy conclusion.


                
I've seen all the Marvel movies so far. And although it nice seeing all the characters together it couldn't really convince me. A couple of things bothered me; 1. Wipe out half the universe? Really? 
2. The humor didn't work for me. They tried, but previous movies were simply better with the jokes. 
3. Some marvel characters not in the movie because they had family issues? While someone is trying to wipe half the universe? 
4. The storyline felt a bit too much and chaotic. The CGI was great however and at no point in time i felt it becamw boring. Well worth going to the theaters for, bur a bit overrated here at IMDB.
Unpopular opinion: the Avengers movies have been suffering from the law of diminishing returns. The solo movies still work brilliantly, but the giant ensembles started collapsing under the weight of characters and plot lines right around when Ultron showed up. This one faired slightly better for a few reasons. First, the giant cast divided and conquered, allowing for A, B, C, D, and E plots - and each story worked pretty well. Second, they have introduced so many new (and funny) characters to the MCU that this edition was infused with some fresh energy and laughter. Buuuut...there were still too many characters. A movie like this cannot reach the heights of Homecoming, Ragnorok, or Black Panther. Less is more. So this film inevitably succumbed to being more about setting up future franchises than about the characters themselves. It was fun and intense, but I'm looking forward to when the stories get smaller and more focused again.


                
This was a half-decent movie. I really like the parts that have Dr. Strange in them. If there is one criticism of this movie, it is that of the decisions of the heroes and the mistakes they make during the course of the plot. It's like they're all suffering from Bipolar and can't compose themselves or take themselves seriously enough to get a grip! I mean after all, the fate of the entire UNIVERSE is at stake!!!! Yes that is literally the plot line. I will now have to do some research because I am not a comic book guy, so this peeked my interest.


                
My favourite MCU movies are The Winter Soldier, Ironman and even the first Avengers movie. I was hoping this one reaches or surpasses those, but I don't think this has. This is more like a bigger version of Ultron, much much bigger in scale. Might have enjoyed this much more as a teenager (I guess its mainly the teens who are the ones leaving 10/10 reviews), but now I need a superhero movie to deliver more than just the basic elements (great CGI, big scale, humour and good fight scenes - these things MCU usually gets right, and here they have outdone themselves yet again).For me Superhero movies (like epic fantasy movies) need to explain the power of each individual - specially the limitations of power, the character flaws, and consistent application of these rules. Those are the things that make it interesting. Limitless power is boring. Which is why I am not a big fan of Superman or Captain Marvel, but I like Spiderman, Ironman and even Batman. In the current MCU universe, the powers and specially the limitations of some characters are not well defined - like Dr Strange, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and Antman. Some of the things they can do almost makes them all-powerful and you wonder why don't they use those powers to get out of every situation. This is where this movie lets us down - that consistency and power definition is lacking.Warning: Spoilers aheadFirstly, the good stuff: 1. Opening scene & Hulk: Loved the opening scene, and the fact that the hulk is beatable too. Even better was the psychological impact of this beating as Banner is not able to summon the Hulk at will. This adds so much depth to the character. 2. Darker tone: Set up so well in the opening scene, it is good to see MCU taking a bit darker tone - superhero's can also die. That makes this universe more unpredictable and so much more interesting. Also the layers in characters - they really developed Thanos character well in this movie - showing his emotional side helped. 3. Captain America: Never one of my favourite superheros, I like how his personality is changing and growing with every movie. The treatment of his gradual change is so consistent, you can see a "perfect person" is slowing changing into a more real person. Maybe they should have given him a bigger role, but perhaps that will happen in the next movie. 4. MCU set up: I guess this is the best part for all MCU fans, how all 18 previous movies have logically been leading up to the storyline of this one. The consistency and scale of this set up (while not perfect) is quite mind blowing - 18 standalone stories covering into one. The Bad: 1. The time stone: I hate that stone. Any power which can go back in time to change history usually ruins the story for me because most writers don't know how to handle it. Its usually a cop out for bad writers to escape from writing a good story. Lets just kill everyone to shock the audience, then just rewind it to solve the problem. Terrible ending, this rewinding time bit was the worst part of the movie. 2. Supernova: Thor can survive a blast from a freaking supernova, really? That whole scene was so ridiculous, treating the audience like 5 year olds. Maybe if he had died there to create the weapon for someone else, that may have redeemed that scene a bit.3. Thanos and the power of stones: The power of the stones and their limitations are not very well defined. We don't see Thanos growing in power with the addition of every stone, infact he looks stronger in the first scene with just one stone than in most of the movie with 2-3 stones. Rewinding time apart, now with 6 stones he can kill 50% of the universe with a click of his fingers, but cannot stop Thor from burying his axe into his chest? Doesn't make sense. Might have made a better movie if they had let Scarlet witch destroy 1 stone, so that no one is all powerful. 4. Consistency of powers: Vision and Scarlet Witch should not need help from the likes of Black Widow and Falcon, just like a tank does not need help from an ant. I guess this is a problem because the limitations of powers of Vision and Scarlet Witch haven't been defined properly before. Maybe if they had previously shown that Vision cannot function well when he is injured or that Scarlet Witch isn't every effective when she is emotional, that scene could have made sense. Overall a good movie for watching once. But the time rewind thing is easily the main problem with this movie. With the post credit scene, I guess they have set it up very nicely for the Captain Marvel movie, which will lead nicely into the 2nd part of this movie - MCU does that so well. Buy I am not looking forward to see an all powerful Captain Marvel taking on an all powerful Thanos, rewinding time to bring back the superheros as per the writers whims and fancies. Yawn.
