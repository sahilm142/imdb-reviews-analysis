 Starts strong but I eventually lost interest

 all it's cracked up to be

 One Of The Best Films Of Its Kind

 Shows Life As A Mirror, Not A Mask

 Life after wartime

 A great telling that even war victors don't get a happy live

 Slow Meditation on Observation

 Good, but overrated

 The First of The Best

 Happy Days

 A powerful film that deals with the hardships some war veterans have adjusting to civilian life

 My Journey Through IMDB's Top #250

 COVERING ALL THE ANGLES

 Absorbing, surprisingly effective heart-tugger...

 would have been perfect if only it had taken an open side against war

 Dated of course, but touching

 Touching, if a bit rose-coloured
