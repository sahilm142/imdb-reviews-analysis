''Rurouni Kenshin'' is one of the best anime series that we can watch, specially if you are a fan of samurais and Japanese habits, since the story is set during the early years of the early Meiji period in Japan. But more then enjoying the anime and the manga, I think the OVAs are the best,not only Kenshin's story is much more interesting , but also we have more accurate facts. The atmosphere is much deeper and serious as well. (And Kenshin's romance with Tomoe is so beautiful and dramatic!)The series,OVAS and manga tells the story of an assassin named Kenshin Himura, best known as the Battousai, a guy who killed many men.Kenshin later grieves for all the lives he's taken, and has vowed that he will never kill again, that's why in the series he is a cute and funny person, while in the OVAS he is deadly cold and lethal.
