An utterly sophomoric attempt at humor via blatant over the top absurdity. The ridiculous or absurd is apparently funny to some. It's just irritating nonsense to me. I made it to just past the halfway points of each of the 1st 2 seasons opening episodes, before crying uncle, and I only made it that far through sheer effort, because it was recommended by a friend. I was ready to bail out 4 minutes into the first episode. That ridiculous parody of a corporate hiring manager told me all I needed to know about the tack the show would take.No wit, not a whiff of reality, nothing approaching real characters, or anything that could accurately be described as a plot. College humor, at best. Way over the top absurdly exaggerated acting. Unless you're a kid, don't waste your time.
