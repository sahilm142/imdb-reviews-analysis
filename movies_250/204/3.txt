After watching the movie i am shocked that it is considered a classic. Maybe because it was unusual for the time , i cannot judge that, but i was extremely disappointed. Especially with the character build up . The one that stands out the most at being ridiculous to the extreme is Jo. In the beginning he is presented as a tough guy who fears nothing , but this does not work at all . He seems ridiculous from the first second he enters the scene . After a while he turns out to be whiny and full of fear , but because the whole build up of the character was so not believable , i did not care at all about his fate or supposed transformation. Of course you can say he should be presented as ridiculous but if that is the case why bother making him such a big character? What really disturbed me is the way the relationship between yes montand and the girl in the city is presented. It is very sexist and the whole macho culture of the movie was getting on my nerves a lot after a while.
