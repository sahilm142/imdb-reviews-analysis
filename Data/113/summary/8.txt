 Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.

 Kurosawa is just so damn good

 Too drawn out

 Says Who?

 "The Ferocity of Men"

 magnificent masterpiece

 A delight to watch

 An Intriguing Study Of The Human Condition As Well As The Malleable Nature Of Truth

 Thoughtful, stylish old classic

 The first akira kurosawa film I have ever seen

 If you can handle older movies and reading subtitles then this is worth your time.

 Brilliant

 The Bandit, The Samurai, and the Woman

 Revolutionary storytelling

 A Tarnished Gem

 Kurosawa's elaborate, intricately-plotted masterwork

 "This time, I may finally lose my faith in the human soul."

 They all might be genuinely thinking to themselves that they're telling the truth

 Great film with amazing influence

 "I don't understand my own soul."

 Perhaps more linear than not

 Technique sends differing messages

 Rashmon

 an perplexing murder mystery, without Poirot to explain

 Humanities truth is a vague lie
