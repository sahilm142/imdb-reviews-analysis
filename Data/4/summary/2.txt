 Not even the best movie of 2008.

 9.0 Are You Kidding Me?

 Not what Batman is supposed to be

 The Joke(r) is on Us!

 Over-hyped....I must be missing something.

 Don't GO!!

 The Most Overrated Over Bloated Batman movie ever!!!

 No emotion, no rhythm, tremendously overrated

 Overrated

 piece of crap

 Aimless string of car crashes and explosions

 Aren't we a little overblown about Dark Night movie?

 Lemmings to the Cliff

 Horrible Movie

 The greatest thing about this film is its capacity to bore

 Really didn't like it (warning - some spoilers)

 Don't believe the hype.not even close as good as Ironman

 Pathetic, Unbelievable, now in my Trash Can

 Dull

 No

 Uuh...Do You Want Me To Be Honest?

 sorry, i couldn't take it seriously

 Over Rated Garbage

 Did I see a different film than most of you?

 Once you are shallow, then Batman seems deep...
