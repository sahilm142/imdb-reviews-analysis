 Watch the original 2 seasons

 Shallow and exaggerated

 Decent, but pretentious

 It's all about how Technology affects our lives

 Overall it's fantastic

 Some great episodes. Would be a 10 if they were consistent!

 Some folks judged this show purely based on episode one.

 Season 4: Medium

 Skip season 4, except the last episode.

 Scare me silly.... sometime in the future?

 Yes, more that what meets the eyes !

 A mixed bag for me: some I loved, some where okay, one I hated. First 3 seasons reviewed.

 Depends on which episode...

 BLACK MIRROR'MIRRORING'

 Pretty Good Techno-Anthology Series!

 Black Mirrorverse Revealed

 A fascinating anthology of horrifying and hopeful stories.

 Mirror, mirror.....

 San Junipero & Nosedive

 Technologies make it easier to see our problems

 It's Brilliant. But very mind bending depressive

 great and interesting at first but evventually

 Some Good, Some Bad
