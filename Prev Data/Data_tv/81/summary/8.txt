 The first episode sure piqued my interest. Here's why:

 Another solid season for BCS

 Amazing Drama, the surprise element is present, so thrilling, the series is walking by itself now.

 Great Cast, Glacially-paced plot, Still worth every minute

 Got better the more I watched

 A captivating dramatic series with one fault

 Is Better Call Saul better than Breaking Bad? Of course.

 Living up to the promise - episode 3

 If you like Breaking Bad ....

 Just finished Season 3 and it is pretty good

 Amazing Series!

 If you watch it without comparing it to Breaking, it's actually really good

 It filled the void in my heart that was left Behind from the after math of Breaking Bad.

 Funny and brilliant, Saul, or Jimmy, is back to his old tricks!

 Love it so much that i hate it

 Looks very promising!

 Odenkirk rocks

 Special spin-off

 Better Call Saul - The Cliffhangers we don't need.

 It's A Tense Atmosphere Here. <U+2666> 84%

 Stepping into some pretty big Clarks Wallabees

 Lots of Potential to be Another Classic

 The Breaking Bad spin off starring that nutty lawyer

 Delivers what Breaking Bad failed to

 Pretty much Breaking Bad !
