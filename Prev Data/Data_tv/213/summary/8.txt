 The two problem

 Muy buena!

 An Amazing Show, But Not Up to Par with its Predecessor.

 Keep your expectations a bit lower.

 i'm ready for the next season.

 not as good as the second season of narcos columbia

 Kinda Slow starts but with high expectation regardless

 Great one

 Mexico !

 What a pleasant surprise

 tangled web of sleaze

 Spanish Cusswords translation is stupid

 Very Good Addition , but Felt Rushed!

 Good show bad acting

 Starts slowly picks up pace quickly and ends brilliantly

 Great show.

 The last two episodes saved it from being mediocre

 Still great. The formula and style are still going strong. Only a couple of things missing.

 Above my expectations

 The police counterparts and families don't have enough charisma as in the previous seasons

 Good show

 Narcos Mexico: Different Country, Same Chaos

 Great show but lacks an accurate timeline
