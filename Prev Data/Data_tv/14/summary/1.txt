 Incredible footage that will amaze you more than Planet Earth.

 An excellent documentary showing us nature in its glory...

 Absolutely Amazing, But Not Perfect

 Attenborough for Children

 Life

 A fascinating look at the wide range of lifeforms on Earth

 Wondrous Life

 Great document, amazing narration, but IMO too much loud, cheesy music and censor.

 Good, however a few problems.

 Good documentary
