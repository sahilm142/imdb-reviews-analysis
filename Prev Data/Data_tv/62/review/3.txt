Gosh I love this show, always will. But so sick of politics being forced down our throat in literally everything these days.I consider my self a Democrat, but come on, I just want to watch an absolute genius, comedic masterpiece of a tv series without it trying to tell me how much further left I need to lean.Just looking for some entertainment.


                
I can start by pointing out how I already know this will be deleted or voted down to oblivion because you people don't like honest reviews. The cult following this attempt at comedy has garnered will turn to me with ire and scorn for saying anything negative about this longstanding "gem". The thing is, this show just ISN'T funny. Maybe I've been spoiled by ACTUAL funny people, but this shows dark humor fails to deliver every time. Sure, maybe it's forced a chuckle occasionally, but at least 95% of the time, it's just disappointing. I don't find the topics approached by the gang "edgy" or "sensitive," nor is the stance taken ever fresh or creative. If you're a fan of weak dark humor, and mediocre jokes, dive right in. This show is for you. In all honesty, this show is more for people who have no comedic value, nor understand it. The cast is lackluster with the exclusion of Charlie Day and Danny DeVito, Any attempt to think of what the plot may be falls to quick confusion; the same effect is found if you question how the show remains on television. The show is bad, not dark humor, not funny, very disappointing. Now that you've read an honest review, thumb me down for disagreeing with you!
