My impression of this show is pretty much the opposite of the critics; which is to say, it started off fun (quite excellent actually), then went downhill. And that's the key word: "fun" - which this show has lost.This show simply takes itself a bit too seriously. I stopped watching this series at Season 5 ep 10; the main characters have reached a point where they're simply not likable anymore. The secondary characters - while likable, aren't interesting anymore. I have no idea what's in for Season 6, but I'm uninterested in finding out given the series' downward trajectory.Unless you have a fetish for depression, there doesn't appear to be much to look forward to in future episodes of this show.
