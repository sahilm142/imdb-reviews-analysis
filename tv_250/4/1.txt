I read the negative reviews with disbelief and decided to watch this program anyway. Well, they (the negative reviews) were 100% right. This is a very pedantic and simplistic view of nature which focuses entirely on hunting and killing. After 10 minutes and 10 gallons of blood, I couldn't take it any more. This is a very poorly planned and unsatisfying documentary, despite its zillion dollar budget and fancy camera-work. I can sum up the entire series in 9 words: "Things with sharp teeth kill things without sharp teeth." There, I've saved you a few hours of your life. Now go watch Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, a dated but still far superior effort.
