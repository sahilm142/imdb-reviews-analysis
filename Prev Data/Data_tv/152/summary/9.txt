 I Laughed, I Cried. Then I Watched Louie, and Really F$@#ing Laughed.

 Louie (Fox) - Review

 Louis CK's seamless transition to TV

 If you don't mind heavy material, "Louie" is quite possibly the best comedy on TV right now

 A dark, honest and confronting, but really funny comedy

 A show about you and me

 A brave and highly original comedy series

 Way too good for it's own good

 Intelligent feel-good pretending to be less

 The Louie weird tv series and weird man
