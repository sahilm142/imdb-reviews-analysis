 A masterpiece, if you can find the real version

 loyalty, bravery, and adventure after an apocalypse

 The film of all times.

 The greatest movie ever built

 Early masterpiece by Miyazaki finally gets the treatment it deserves.

 If Miyazaki had made that film only, his legacy would have been the same...

 Excellent!

 Miyazakis very best

 The most beautiful Anime film ever made!

 a tale pure goodness, and the inanities of greed, in human beings, set in Miyazaki's amazing world

 Brilliant!

 Ah! That old man, Miyazaki

 Truly Enchanting

 One of the best films I've even seen, if not THE best

 Miyazaki's best

 This has a perfection about it.

 That's not a dress Nausicaa is wearing.

 Miyazaki at his best.

 Unbelievable piece of work

 so human, it could not have been maid with film.

 Hayao Miyazaki is the greatest story-teller ever.

 Complex, beautiful, moving and profound

 Miyazaki is the master
