 The greatest journeys UP are when you're most down

 Move Thee Reviews: Up Lets Me Down

 "Up"

 loses its way at times but endearing in large part

 Ignore the studio plants. The movie was good, but not great.

 High marks

 Convenient adventure story thrills you visually

 Sweet sentimentality and raucous kiddie comedy...not always a sublime mixture, but the intentions are true

 Let's stop congratulating Pixar

 Fantastic Madcap Adventure Of Old Man Who Flies Away In His House

 No milestone in movie history.

 Humor and morals, who could ask for anything more!?!

 Good, but not as good as the hype says

 Warm film

 That beginning

 Would recommend

 "Adventure is out there!"

 Just my thoughts on the movie

 It is a lovely story but why the animation?

 not just cute.....

 A colorful delight.

 Happiness is a simple thing...

 Up: Just Fine

 Not such a fun movie

 Floating..
