My wife and I were able to see this film at a cold and draughty venue such as is only proper for a local Film Club. My wife dozed fitfully throughout but I was cursed with a bout of insomnia. This is a very dull film by any standards and the static cinematography does not do justice to what could well be ravishingly beautiful shots of post-war Japan. The acting is extremely mannered. The dialogue (though this could be the fault of the translation) is some of the most clichéd I have ever seen in a movie. Worst of all though, I believe Tokyo Story suffers from a problem that many modern American blockbusters exhibit. As a viewer I got the message loud and clear by the time the old couple leave Tokyo and everything after that was superfluous. I couldn't believe how many extra scenes followed. Apart from the daughter-in-law, all the children are ungrateful brats. Yes, thank you. It's obvious how badly they are all going to act when the mother dies and showing it is just an insult to our intelligence. "Stop the film" I wanted to cry out time and time again. A good example of the redundancy is right at the end: shot of old man looking lonely; shot of river; shot of old man; shot or river; closer shot of river. I can only think that you need a much closer affinity with Japanese culture to understand the subtleties. Either that or be a pretentious film critic. I would also add that I do not consider myself to a philistine or addicted to modern action films. I am in my fifties and have a very wide taste in film. Kurusawa's film Ikuru is one of my all time favourites and it has a lot in common with Tokyo Story but IMHO it is superior in every aspect to this over-rated and stupendously dull movie.
