 A perfect holiday without leaving home.

 "There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity... He was one of them. "

 One of the most underrated films by IMDB standards.

 Simply wonderful

 So so good.

 Wes Anderson

 Intelligent and refreshingly original.

 Keeping Things Classy

 A brave work of art that leaves you dangled over its simple complexity.

 Quirky...

 The grand Budapest Hotel: I liked it so much that I'm afraid to get cheesy.

 Touches on universal themes and has a serious purpose

 Perfection of Anderson

 fellini on acid

 You had me at Wes Andersen

 Unconventionally Entertaining and Visually Stunning

 Not since "Princess Bride"

 a story within a story and so on, gives Anderson a chance to enchant us all with his wit and skills that already was known from his earlier efforts

 'I go to bed with all my friends.'

 Anderson At His Best

 Excellent!

 A truly stunning and spectacular masterpiece from Wes Anderson.

 And now for something completely different. Wes Anderson's best.

 Film as an art form

 Wes Anderson's Finest
