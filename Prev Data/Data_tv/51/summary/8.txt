 Enjoyable Comedy

 big let down

 Great series

 Hilarious sitcom with heart

 A terrific comedy that falls off a bit near the end

 Not too bad if you look at it as it's own show

 Collectors Item

 The Office cannot be compared with anything else!

 Hysterically brilliant...

 Hey, It's Better Than Anything Else Out There

 good show if you're not a fan of the original

 Cannot hold a candle to the original, but...

 Capsule Review: The Office (US)

 Started out great, didn't progress well...

 Deserved its moment in the sun

 Brave.

 Some people seriously need to get over themselves

 Honestly - this will be a great show

 As an original Office lover, pretty impressed!

 i give it an eight because

 Loved it

 Great show, easy to watch and have a guaranteed laugh
