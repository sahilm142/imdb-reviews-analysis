 "Luke" is a character Newman was born to play - and this is one hell of a beautiful film

 Not just a prison film, but an excellent film about not being able to conform in a world that requires it

 A classic that became a big part of my life

 Sticking it to the Man

 One of the top ten films ever made

 Some men you just can't reach.

 Oh Luke you wild beautiful thing!

 The Philosophy of Nothing, or: Everyman's Guide to Enjoying Life

 Wow, George Kennedy?

 Cool Hand Luke - Period Piece with A Message

 The Essence of Cool in "Cool Hand Luke"

 Cool as can be.

 Great movie

 A rebel wants his freedom

 Really Cool

 10 out of 10!

 Prison As The Establishment

 A loser never wins

 Can U Say CAR WASH!

 When Nothing Is A Real Cool Hand

 The best prison movie ever...

 A film that has more than aged well... it has gotten better.

 It's a chain-gang for God's sake

 The power of non-conformity

 A rebel movie for everyone
