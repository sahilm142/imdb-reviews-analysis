 Good movie, reflecting witch hunt mentality in social media/TV

 Maybe, maybe not

 Gone but not forgotten

 I expected more

 Why to watch Gone Girl/Why not Gone girl

 David Fincher crafts a meticulous picture with a bravura performance from Rosamund Pike...

 Well done and all that but highly unsatisfying

 Terrific until the 140th minute

 "Basic Instinct" or "Fatal Attraction" For a New Era

 Captures Most Of The Book's Bizarre Mystery

 Gone over the top...

 Good rithm bad conclusion

 Now I'm never getting married. Ever.

 The unreliable narrator

 Good thriller. Not a #250 Best, but interesting nevertheless.

 I will never get married.

 decent movie. absolutely over-hyped

 Too far

 Great movie .... not very good ending .

 Over-rated

 A long yet consistently evolving and tightly-woven thriller.

 A fairly original gripping murder mystery

 Into a trap.

 The cool things in the movie

 Twisty, Turny and Temperamental, Gone Girl Will Hook You to the Very End
