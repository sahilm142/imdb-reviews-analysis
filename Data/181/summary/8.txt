 Best dinosaur film ever made

 A milestone in its time

 An Adventure 65 Million Years In The Making

 Awesome Sci-fi take!

 A Great Adventure

 Jurassic Park is director Steven Spielberg at his best, but sadly, it doesn't come out as a polished picture

 Going Back in Time.

 Stomped its competition, and had fun doing it

 A true classic

 Iconic and Fun, Even if It's Not Your Thing

 An Amazing piece of art

 The Ultimate Technical Achievement

 Interesting premise about DNA of a prehistoric dinosaur taken from an ancient insect is wonderfully developed

 A Fine Effort

 Walking out of the theater shaking like a leaf

 Revolutionary.

 Ok Why isn't this in the top 250??

 A well-made thrill ride with dinosaurs.

 "He's gonna eat the Goat?" Top notch Dinosaur entertainment for all the family.

 A classic Speilberg, scare film.

 Jurassic Park

 Dino movies can't recreate the authenticity of JP

 The lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, uh... staggers me.

 Revolutionary technical feat

 Jurassic Park directed by Steven Spielberg
