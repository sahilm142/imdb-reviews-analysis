 within Vietnam and beyond

 One Of The Best Movies Of The 1980s

 Not just surface Violence (see book Tropic Thunder, Red Lightning)

 Up there with Apocalypse Now and FMJ as one of the best films to depict the horrors of the Vietnam war...

 Still packs a punch 30 years on

 Brutal but honest.....

 Platoon is so much more than just your average war film.

 Thoroughly brutal, but effective portrayal of the Vietnam War

 Platoon is a Film of Inspiring Empathy and Implacable Force!

 Hauntingly excellent movie on the Vietnam War which will stay with you forever.

 Vietnam, as frank as you can see it, without the gloves

 The Vietnam War is recreated with striking realism in Platoon.

 Brilliantly Done

 Definitely the best anti-war movie

 "... we did not fight the enemy; we fought ourselves"

 Oliver Stone's view of the Vietnam War

 Stone's personal experience during the Vietnam War

 The best War Movie ever made

 Not Just A Great War Movie.

 Holy sh*t....

 Exciting war film from start to end

 Thank God I wasn't drafted.

 Great conveyed cruel reality!
