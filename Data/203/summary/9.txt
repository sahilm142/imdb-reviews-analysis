 Casablanca for the 1990's - pure cinematic gold

 One of those few movies that actually - ACTUALLY - feel like real life

 "Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?"

 A luminous Sunrise

 A Painfully Realistic Story of Young Love

 Brilliant Film

 Pleasantly surprised! Highly recommended

 Irresistibly romantic.

 The most realistic romantic film I've watched

 well more than a pleasant journey

 I don't usually like these films but...

 Before Sunrise

 Best romantic movie I ever watched

 Magic connection & soul mate

 Sweet-cakes and milkshakes

 Beautiful movie

 The impact and idea of time and the power of human connection explored in one beautiful package

 Not Your Run of the Mill Romance

 a movie about innocence

 Something for the romantics

 The best "cinema" of 1995

 Great Movie

 One of the most intelligent romances ever seen on screen

 Sweet, but not cloying

 straight romance
