 Take it from a real submariner-

 15 years and I'm still thinking about it

 Epic

 Reality

 The best submarine film ever made.

 Gripping, Compelling, Intense, Suspenseful, Realistic

 Nearly four hours long, and never a dull moment!

 Packing, genuinely, overwhelming!

 Moving Beyond Measure

 The best depiction of fighting men....ever!

 One of the BEST war movies ever

 German Masterpiece

 The best WWII movie ever!!!

 The most intense movie I have seen!

 One of My Top 5 Movies EVER

 Listen up Hollywood - this is how its done

 See the original 6 part epic rather than the film

 Unsurpassed; indeed, unsurpassable

 Not Your Typical War Movie

 Probably the greatest WWII naval movie

 The best film I've seen in years

 A True Reflection of a U-boat crews life

 Where great story telling meets realism!

 Das Boot (the boat) is without doubt one of the finest movies ever!

 Lost men in a lost war
