 Sugar-coated Trojan horse

 Possibly the most overrated film in history.

 A Really Bad Box of Chocolates

 More corn than Kelloggs

 Appalling, manipulative garbage

 Don't waste your time with this stupid movie.

 A 140 Minute Sentimental Gimmick

 Pathetic

 The Worst Best Picture Winner in 71 Years!

 History Made Stupid

 A Big, Colorful, Sprawling, Epic Insult to Our Intelligence!

 Didn't like or get the message

 Very, very bad

 A thoroughly nasty piece of work

 "Being an idiot is no box of chocolates" (the original line from the novel)

 Patronising Rubbish

 The reason IMDb needs to introduce the zero rating

 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwww

 The apex of Hollywood trash

 Avoid this movie

 Dreadful

 This will break hearts

 Celebration of Mediocrity

 Overrated And Unbelievable

 why I think this movie stinks
