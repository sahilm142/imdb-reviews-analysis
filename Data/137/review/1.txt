First, Stanley Kramer's overweight and star-laden movie version was way inferior to the television version which I think was on Playhouse 90 but anyway was a superior production. This was Hollywood's first major attempt (and a successful one) to re-write the history of World War II and make it "all about the Jews." These days young people think that's ALL World War II was about. For all the non-Jews who fought and lost their lives in WWII, the Jews owe a debt of recognition to the 25% of inmates slaughtered in the Death Camps who were Catholics and other faiths. As for Mr. Kramer's production, it suffered from dismal acting by Mr. Sternface Spencer Tracy doing his best grumble routine, and Judy Garland's shameless Oscar-grab nice try. Maxmillian Schell was the sole bright spot, and I give him credit. Any film about the Holicaust, by the way, is an "automatic" 4-star review grabber because there aren't any film reviewers with the b___s to give a thumbs down to any such picture. Neither Hollywood nor anyone else ought ever forget the invasion of Czechoslavakia, of Poland, the bombing of 20,000 buildings in 20 minutes at Rotterdam, the bombing of London.... nor the deaths of so many Americans, et cetera. No, Mr. Kramer, it was indeed NOT all about the Jews.


                
I think that it went a little too far with all the footage of the real camps. Yes, those things happened and while it may have been important to the story to show some, I don't think it was necessary to show as much as they did. The movie was also very long and got a bit boring. I think that it would have been better had they cut it down some. Though I do think that CLift was robbed of yet another Oscar. Shell did deserve his Oscar. I think that all the acting was very well preformed. Lancasters should have been nominated. He did a wonderful job just sitting there with a blank expression on his face for most of the movie.
