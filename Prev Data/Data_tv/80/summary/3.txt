 A waste of time

 This show is a disappointment I watched the pilot and felt it had potential.

 Stop Whispering!!

 I've tried watching it. I cant stand it.

 Award-winning Crap is still Crap

 Not real sf, more fantasy... or something

 I don't know why this is supposed to be good

 Fantasy gobbledygook

 Absurdly overrated mediocre show

 It's not Sci-fi, it's a frakking bible story.

 Collapsed world

 Horrendous

 No Sci-Fi here, only divine intervention

 Frustrating mix of greatness and drivel

 Tremendous idea, good cast, good filming , horrible horrible plots and writing.

 Why do people like this?

 terrible
