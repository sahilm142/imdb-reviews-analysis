Warning: Contains major spoilers!It should also have had someone else directing! Ricky was way too close, writing, acting and directing this. A different director would probably have given it much more perspective, offered a lighter touch and stopped Ricky from playing his part so morbidly.Yes, we get the point. He used to be a nice guy but now he doesn't care. This seems to give him a license to do what he wants, and not worry about anyone else.When you think (as I did) is that the entire series is going to be based on this premise, it makes it very hard to keep watching. Fortunately, Ricky has been cleverer than that, and has actually written in an arc of discovery for his miserable character. Most of this arc takes place in the last episode.It is very hard to believe that all the other characters would put up with his moaning, whinging, self absorbed person. Surely one of them would have told him to shut the FK up and think about others - before the last few episodes.I think it would have made a great movie - as long as Ricky just wrote it.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON ONETony (Ricky Gervais) has just lost Lisa (Kerry Godliman), his wife and best friend, to breast cancer, and keeps her memory alive by watching a series of laptop recordings she made for him to see after her death. As a result of this, with his meaning to living gone forever, he refuses to put on a respectful front for anyone any more, and just lets rip, saying exactly what he thinks to the various people in his life who annoy him. His life aimlessly ambles from his job at the local newspaper, his run ins with his boss and brother in law Matt (Tom Basden), his apathetic psychiatrist (Paul Kaye), Lenny (Tony Way), his slobbish colleague, and his father (David Bradley) who still thinks Lisa's alive. But could the nurse (Ashley Jensen) who cares for him at his retirement home, be the key to some possible future happiness?Just when it felt as though he may no longer be relevant, Ricky Gervais returns with another sitcom, the format with which he made his name, that takes the dark edge and uncomfortable social scenarios that are his trademark and ramps them up to factor ten. Here delving into a deeply tragic backdrop of grief and loss, he's pushing the boundaries in a way like he never has before, obviously with a confidence with what he's got away with before. If you're familiar with any of his previous works, you have no excuse not to know what to expect here, and you'd better just strap yourself in and prepare for some deeply dark laughs.This is essentially a darker variation on his previous filmic effort The Invention of Lying, albeit where he's let off his leash a bit, and not constrained by a softer, sanitised American approach, with him telling everything like it is to whoever he wants. As with everything he's been in, he's not really an actor playing a part, just portraying himself in a different persona. And he's surely applying his unrestrained, politically incorrect humour to proceedings, whether he's giving a junkie money knowing he's sending him to his doom, or threatening a ten year old kid with a hammer (!) Just as well, since he lacks the warmth and empathy to really make the more emotionally charged scenes shine.With the first season coming to an end with a surprising six episodes, it's a pleasingly condensed alternative to the usual drawn out yarns Netflix is known for. Despite touching on more sensitive subjects, it remains typical Gervais, your enjoyment entirely dependent on whether you can stomach his humour or not. ***
While the show tackles important subjects humorously - it's not willing or able to provide serious or funny solutions - I end up wondering, is this a deep or a tacky show.Sure Ricky has always been interested in deep subjects and in this show he speaks about grief, addiction, suicide, relationships, old age etc... but in my opinion falls flat in the execution.After each episode I feel a lot of emotion, and that is ok, but while not learning a lot and not being very impressed or hopeful - I came to realise this is mainly because Ricky has created a caricature of the setting that it's not funny nor real. I'm not sure what is he trying to do. For example the location represents a quaint English village that has the exact amount of local newspapers, drug dealers/addicts, widows, single moms, and oh the sex worker (and a beach) to fit the story. Yeah right! He also lives in a very nice house and can afford a very nice psychiatrist on a measly salary from what seems to be a part time journalist job. Where does he think he lives? Actually I recognise some of the neighbourhoods in North London and I can tell you, Ricky himself with all his success can barely afford to live there let alone this caricature he plays.Ricky has admitted once somewhere (I cannot remember where) that he is baffled how studios and broadcasters take whatever he suggests. He said that any idea he comes up with however stupid will have an audience and Netflix, Channel4 or Sky will jump on it not because its quality but just because they will make money off it. This is a prime example because i think he spent, what, maybe a month coming up with it.Oh and "Louie" the show, is a lot better and much more subtle when talking about these important subjects.


                
Really enjoyed this series. Very funny and superbly acted by the quality cast. No quite as good as "The Detectorists" , the series felt tonally similar but hopefully series 2 will be even better.


                
This show was fairly easy to watch. At times it's tiresome because it's basically Ricky Gervais using this show to moan about the same things he moans about in everything else he does. It's kind of like watching his character Andy Millman from Extras if he lost his wife. He moans about everyone else, but every now and again realises he's moaning a lot and does something kind for someone else to remind you that he's actually wonderful.On the plus side, when he's being rude to people (something Gervais does well) it's very funny and I enjoyed the excessive use of the C-word. His character Tony uses his grieving as an excuse to tell people what he really thinks of them, so if you found Jack Nicholson amusing in As Good As It Gets then this should be right up your street.On the downside, the one hangdog expression that Gervais does all the time to convey his depression has absolutely no subtlety to it. In fact subtlety is seriously lacking here and that's the only thing that stops this from being brilliant. Instead of showing the viewer how he comes through his depression, you are constantly told word for word what is happening. Characters launch into long monologues explaining what depression is all about and how to cope with it, which is a fairly lazy and amateurish way to do it. And every time one of these monologues takes place there's the sad music and the characters have tears welling up in their eyes. It's a classic example of telling the audience what's going on and how to feel instead of showing it, which is a more powerful way to do it.Overall though, I did like this show. It was easy to watch, and even though the characters were stereotypes, they were all likeable, although if you weren't sure, Gervais does make a point of announcing that each person is wonderful, because, you know, no subtlety.I like the village that it's set in too, and the message of the show is sound, without getting all political (apart from Gervais's usual rants about social media etc). Either way, I agree with most of his rants about people, and the show is at its best when he's calling people out for being disingenuous. It's also made well enough to hide its limited budget. Each episode sees Gervais in the same settings, - with a woman on a park bench, in a therapist's office, visiting his father in a care home and in his workplace. I wouldn't be surprised if some of these sections were filmed in less than a day. For example, the six scenes on the park bench could all be filmed in one day. Gervais is usually wearing the same clothes in each episode too.I suspect most people will quite like this show, although it depends on whether you like Ricky Gervais or not. I find him funny when he's abusing people, but I wish he'd find some new things to moan about.


                
If you don't find Ricky Gervais too annoying it's a decent watch. Gets serious at times but the funny bits keep it watchable.


                
It is far too early to review Gervais' new black comedy about a fed up, recently widowed bloke who is fifty sev...ya know, in this fifties....but let's do it anyway. Thus far there is less cringe, which I love Gervais for, and more observational dark humour, which I like Gervais for. The situations mind you, only ever start to get funny and silly before they swiftly end instead of spiraling into the realm of hilarious and cringy. There is of course heart, like most of Gervais' stuff but a little too much in this episode for my liking. There are scenes where things could get really wacky and silly but they instead get grave and sentimental. Then again I guess it's a matter of taste. Gervais' comedies have always benefited when the other main, characters are off-the-wall and quirky to a t, but from the first look at who will be the reoccurring characters - there is little to get excited about in my opinion. Time will tell I guess.


                
I was ready to give up after three episodes. Glad I didn't. Not what I expected and more drama than comedy.


                
Some hilarious clips, just wish the unnecessary jabs at people of faith, or really just Christians, was left out of every episode.
