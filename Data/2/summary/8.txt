 A film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema

 Slightly overrated

 Mario Puzo's soapy Mafia saga

 A real classic in the crime genre

 I remember when I saw this film for the first time...

 "He is a good godson."

 Pretty good, but bore at times.

 More like the "Godless" Father....

 Greatest Movie in World History? Maybe. Maybe Not.

 It is great, but hardly the best

 The one, The Original!

 Doors, windows, mirrors

 I Know I'm In The Minority.....

 One of the most over rated films

 Good

 Classic

 Loved

 A proper mafia film

 Occult Fiction

 Family is forever

 recommended...

 Overrated? Maybe a little bit.

 Great and stable Acting

 it good

 amazing
