 Swank! Eastwood! Freeman!

 Superb!

 One of the Great Love Stories Trapped Within a Flawed Film

 A knockout film!

 'Million Dollar Baby'... Priceless

 Aamzing story........

 Here Here Clint Eastwood

 watch it..... then watch it again

 A familiar story that's told well

 Excellent Performances

 the boxing movie for the decade, poignant, funny and beautiful..

 a knockout of a drama

 clint is a master

 Greatest Movie of All Time

 A much more poignant, heartfelt Rocky

 Eastwood, Nicholson, Hoffman ignore the whiners....

 Agree or disagree with it's controversial ending,you'll come away knowing you just watched a powerful drama.

 Clint will never let us down!

 No gratuitous sex but eye-averting violence

 Million Dollar Movie

 Mark of a Great Storyteller

 A film so haunting that ultimately it becomes impossible to forget

 Don't Get Boxed In! Check This Baby Out!

 Somebody Up There (at the Academy) Likes Me---8/10.
