 not for me

 Grandiose, I'll give it that

 Third time is the charm

 Not the Best Spaghetti Western

 A slow but good classic film

 'Spaghetti' Western is a misleading term, this is some fine Italo-American cuisine.

 A grand closure to a fantastic saga.

 A memorable Western with a peculiar international flair

 An outstanding Western film

 Too Bad Eli Wallach Ruined the Movie!

 The archetype, the archetype, and the archetype

 Effective sound track

 The king of westerns

 One of the best? No. Potentially one of the best? Absolutely.

 Simply good but turning bad later.

 Feels so long

 GREAT MOVIE

 Unforgettable

 Great western

 Tuco (Eli Wallack) gives the biggest impact
