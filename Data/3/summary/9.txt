 Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under "sprawl"

 As good as the original...

 Not Far Behind The First Film

 "Michael, I Never Wanted This For You."

 No, no: it's a sequel like any other

 In Some Ways Even Better Than the First One...

 The Godfather: Part II

 Incredible doesn't even BEGIN to describe it

 This one, is the masterpiece of the series

 Deep dive into Michael Corleone's psyche

 Touching perfection...

 Travesty abounds.

 pretty amazing

 Great Movie. Another Winner from Francis Ford Copolla

 A stand alone masterpiece that is, deliberately, slow and epic

 As good as the original!

 Best movie I have ever seen

 The sequel to the best family film ever

 Best sequel ever?

 Greatest Sequel

 ALL TIME

 Wonderful sequel

 Complex and costly sequel

 One question....

 Not as good as Part I or even Part III
