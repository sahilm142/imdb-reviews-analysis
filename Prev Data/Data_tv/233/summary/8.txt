 One of the best TV comedies to hit the air for a while

 Laugh-out-loud ensemble comedy; a "The Office"/"Arrested Development" hybrid (almost...)

 Great show but some characters need tweaking

 Funny AND Smart but they need to lose the slapstick!

 Going downhill...

 A nice family show

 Modernizing TV- it can only be a good thing

 Al Bundy 2.0?

 Great show, but...

 LOVE the show - can't stand Manny - bad actor

 Brilliant except for one flaw, Nolan Gould Can't Act.

 It's good, yet I might be watching for the wrong reasons.

 A fresh and enjoyable family sitcom

 Lilly

 One of the funniest TV shows

 Funny Every time!

 Surprisingly original

 A different spin on an older sitcom

 Lovable series with some flaws

 Funny Despite Itself
