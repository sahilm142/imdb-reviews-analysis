The first season's awesome: acting is great, characters are interesting, and the show's twisted humor keeps everyone on their toes.Unfortunately, I don't know what the heck happened to the crew after the second season because that was the beginning of very odd twists, ridiculous character development, and over-the-top drama that not even Woody Allen himself would touch.It gets progressively weirder until you find that you really want many of the cast members to die/get arrested/get written off somehow.I watched it through mid 5th season, and when I found that there really wasn't anything that could possibly redeem the show, I stopped watching it. The show ended exactly the way I predicted it would, and I felt no regret for skipping however many hours of my life the entire season finale would've taken from me. Peter Krause gets REALLY annoying after a while, too.


                
I really enjoyed season 1and 2. Worked my way through season 3, and I made to the 3rd, 4th episodes. But the stupidity and repetition really got to me. I wish the writers would stop writing when they don't have anything intelligent to say any more. It would have been a great series if they closed it off at season 3. Actually end of season 2 would have been even better.
