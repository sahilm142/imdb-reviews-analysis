 Crap !

 a terrible would-be successor to "The Shawshank Redemption"

 SUGAR COATED, SHALLOW, INFANTILE, PATRONISING, OVER-LONG HUMBUG

 Horrible!

 Long, Boring, Predictable, Lame Ending

 Bad, long movie about mice in jail

 Oscar? Ha!

 It's not a great film just because they made you cry.

 This film is awful!

 Heavy handed

 absolute waste of time

 Terrible

 awful

 Terrible Movie!

 I cannot believe this movie got an 8+ rating.

 Cookie cutter Christ-story, not what expected.

 Artistic, Epic, & Genius! I say Annoying, Long, & Retarded...

 A pathetic film

 Wow! Very Overrated

 Insulting

 No Sense

 Horrible Adaption of a Great American Novel

 unbelievable disgusting

 Give me break!

 Way too Long for such a simple plot!
