 Makes three hours feel like a lifetime - awful

 Bloated, Self-Absorbed Nonsense

 Lame-o!

 I was disappointed

 Talk about over-hyped

 Proof that Nolan is detached from his characters.

 Mostly Bad...I don't Understand the Hype

 A sad blockbuster attempt at cinema

 Too long, too pretentious, too far-fetch

 Pretentious mess with nice visuals

 Uh.....I Just Don't Get This At All.

 Worst science in a serious movie ever

 protracted, nonsensical

 Wouldn't recommend.

 Dull dull dull, but some incredible visuals

 Interstellar Missed by a Galaxy - 2/10 - *** SPOILERS ***

 Another wow movie

 Dull, over-long better read a good book or watch 2001: A Space Odyssey

 Not my liking...

 A Disappointment

 Don't Waste Your Time.

 Anti-science fiction

 An 8.8 rating? For Garbage?

 Maybe it is just me......

 Boring, clichés, plot holes
