 Viddy Well!

 Overrated empty scenes with classical music

 This is a waste of time to watch

 Kubrick's arrogance in full flight

 The "American" Version (Creepy Escaped Porn)

 A horribly over-rated, over-acted farce

 Practically a parody

 I don't think this is a good film, but I fear I'm in the minority.

 Overrated, pointless (today) and silly

 lackluster dribble

 My comment!!!

 Some good points - but poss the most overrated movie ever!

 Not a great adaptation of the book

 Most over-rated film Evvvvvvvvvvver!!

 Avoid.

 No reason to watch it in 21st century

 Tried to hard

 completely misses the point of the book
