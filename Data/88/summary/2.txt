 Over-hyped and BORING.

 Arty, Pretentious, Boring, Overrated

 Very big let down

 Selt-indulgent, painfully slow and just boring

 Pretentious piece of crap!

 Overrated waste of potential

 A visual & technical phenomenon, but it's about as exciting as a party political broadcast

 This is one tedious film

 Waste of Electricity

 Recommend Watching At 4x.....8x..Or Even Faster

 Am I missing something?

 2001: An Ode to Stanley Kubrick, by Stanley Kubrick

 Very mundane

 Humanity's fight with deadly boredom

 Can't be watched for more than 10 mins at a time!

 Pretentious Nonsense

 Am I a freak?

 Hype

 Beautiful but empty

 awful

 A real bore.

 Maybe a classic, but certainly not entertaining.

 Extremely overrated

 Snoozefest!
