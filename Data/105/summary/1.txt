 The movie that wasn't a movie...

 Nearly a complete waste of time...

 Entertaining but not for the reasons intended

 Unrelentingly vile

 Amateurish, ragtag film. Nonsensical garbage.

 Stopped Watching

 Scared For Life

 Pointless

 helped begin the decline of gangster movies

 Laughable

 Why is this movie so great?

 Absurd parody

 Worst movie ever?

 Crap

 Garbage

 whyyyyyyyyyy??

 Scarface opinion

 Scarface stinks

 A thoroughly repellent piece of cinematic garbage

 Waste of time!!!

 Sing when your losing! Spoilers.

 Don't bother

 Scarface looks like it was directed by Tommy Wiseau

 Terrible

 overrated remake
