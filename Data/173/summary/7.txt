 Ultraviolent film by Quentin Tarantino with lots of action and amusement

 Great violence film, but incredibly slow-paced and lacks story

 quentin loves himself too much

 Part one of a three plus hour film.

 The Tarantino Experience: all flash and crass sass

 A dizzying collage of styles, textures and visual references

 She Certainly Killed It!

 Revenge and the Black Manba

 An extremely entertaining action movie, which could've focused a little more on character development. (Minor Spoilers)

 f it up uma thurman!!!

 Uma Thurman as an anti-superheroine

 expected a bit more

 Totally over-the-top splatter comic

 Interesting Experiment

 I think it's a damn good flick.

 Poetical violence

 A good disappointment

 Holy Blood Bath Batman!

 "If...you should encounter God, God will be cut"

 Not bad.

 Tantalysing ...

 A Decent Cartoon

 Entertaining, but... Never a Masterpiece (a few spoilers)

 It's Tarantino, And It's Good!

 Good Film, Volume two will be better!
