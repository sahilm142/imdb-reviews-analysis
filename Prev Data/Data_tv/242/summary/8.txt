 Great show, don't listen to the critics...

 Good Show

 X Files for a new generation

 Masterpiece!

 Greately drawn characters with a thrilling plot

 CSI meets The X Files

 Fringe is surprisingly decent

 Absolutely Wonderful

 Almoust a masterpiece

 Captivating

 It has to grow on you.

 Science vs. Emotion vs. Logic

 Fringe is a More than Satisfactory New Television Show

 I like this show!

 Slow Start, Great End

 Like the X-Files, but with SCIENCE instead of aliens.

 Intriguing series. leaves me wanting more

 Creepy and unsettling and I mean that in a good way.

 I will watch more

 Not for the unthinking

 Complex..... yet entertaining

 Pretty Good So Far

 Love it

 similar to "The Outer Limits"
