 Thoughts on Schindler's List

 An All Time Classic....Spielberg's Schindler's List

 Emotional.

 Watch and decide for yourself...

 Tears of Reconciliation

 Good job!

 Great Insight on the Holocaust

 Schindler – The Messiah.

 One of the ultimate anti-war movies

 A truly terrifying picture.

 The film is another example of a number if big budget movies about Holocust and Jewish people in world war II being massacred by Hiltler army.

 People can change.

 Great Film
