this was my third Billy Wilder picture after watching the astonishing 'Sunset Boulevard' and the hilarious and really good 'The Apartment'.it also was my first Marylin Monroe film and did she impress!not only her beauty but also her acting were more than amazing. unfortunately 'some like it hot' is one classic i was disappointed from since it had nothing in it besides princess Marylin.naturally my expectations were very high, after all its a Billy Wilder picture but i guess he just didn't deliver to me personally with this one.we are told in a comic way the story of two broke musicians that are forced to flee their home city after witnessing a murder, Florida is the destination and as females is the only way.there are not to many surprises from this point on and in the end we get a typical happy ending that doesn't leave us with another reaction then, "ok, its over." before writing this i have read a comment saying this to be the funniest movie ever...well, i might have been in a bad mood without noticing but i cant recall myself giving out too many laughs.when you find this interest in you that turns out to be a bit larger then your other interests, the interest i am talking about is the interest in films and film history.in one point you will watch this one movie that will make you want to research and so you will search the net and what you will find is an amazing site called IMDb, in this site you will find a top movies list called IMDb's 250 movies of all time, after a while you will get this crazy idea that you want to watch each and every single movie in it.when this will happen to you and you will get to a movie that is called 'Some Like It Hot' here i say to you, it is highly overrated!


                
I still hold firmly to the believe that people who can laugh scene after scene, movie after movie, to the depiction of applying women's mannerisms on male bodies, are indistinguishable from being permanently brain-injured.To be fair, the movie includes quite a bit of fun besides the cross-dressing. Also, while the transvestism per se isn't funny, it opens nice ways for the plot to develop. (But I guess that also holds true for white guys putting on blackface, eating watermelon and stealing televisions.) So, in short, if you can hold back the civilized reflex disgust of seeing constant mockery of transvestism, this movie might give rise to a few laughs.
