 A Vintage Vehicle but Hardly a Classic

 Shockingly Sloppy film from an Un-Characteristically Lazy Eastwood

 Didn't make my day

 Great Clint Eastwood, and that's about it.

 Risible.

 Forgettable and sanctimonious

 Dirty Harry? No, it's Stinky Wally.

 gran torino.. good???

 Over-rated & over-acted

 Not a very good movie

 Good story, bad execution.

 Dirty Harry retires to Detroit

 A real shocker

 What is happening here?

 This is going to sound politically incorrect...

 Most disappointing film I have ever seen...

 Not enough Character development

 Looked promising but alas!

 Eastwood's engine done blowed up

 Not what I Expected Very Disappointing

 One of the worst C. Eastwood movies I've seen. Ridiculous dialog & poor acting.

 Clint Eastwood was great, but...
