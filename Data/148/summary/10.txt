 For mature minds

 Inside Out is that emotional journey that has been missing from the movies for years. This is one of the best animated stories of all time!

 So much bashing, tsk tsk

 One of the most touching movies I've seen

 One of the best of all times

 A Winner in Every Way

 Best Of Pixar

 Couldn't Believe the Idea!

 Intensely Emotional Magic

 A Magnificent Piece Of Imagination

 A movie which has created an imprint on my life, an experience i would never forget.

 Pure Genius!

 Why are people shocked that this is sad? Did they not see Up?

 Never expected this would come out to be that great !!!!

 Inside Out puts Pixar back on the Map!
