 Anyone who gave this over 5 stars is wrong

 The new crap.

 Wanted to see this... Only to discover a "B" movie with a big budget

 A portent of the apocalypse (the biblical apocalypse, not the marvel villain)

 Worst Marvel Movie So far

 same old junk

 It is artistically and politically as conservative a film as Marvel Studios has ever made

 Hated it

 How can you rate this a 10?

 Fully entertainment

 Great sci-fi film, Bad comic movie!

 See this film only if you are a comic book freak, or under 13

 Marvel phones it in

 Movie of the past

 A forgettable entry in the Marvel Franchise

 Funny at times but over all boring

 Boring........

 Disappointing, and a letdown, and i'll explain why:

 Terrible

 Marvel is losing it.

 Serenity 2: Marvel

 Pay to win.

 This movie is so overrated

 More Overrated Money-Making Garbage From Marvel

 Good, but doesn't match the hype
