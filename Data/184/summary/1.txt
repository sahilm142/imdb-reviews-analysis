 A crime against Freddie and his memory.

 About as historically accurate as "Inglourious Basterds"

 Bohemian Rhapsody is a film that excels in mediocrity.

 History repeats itself: novelist Robert Musil writes his novel "The Man Without Qualities" again.

 Horrible FILM, Great STORY

 Poorly written, Bohemian Rhapsody is a disappointment

 Zero Story

 STOP the hype NOW!!!!!

 Is the Hollywood Foreign Press on CRACK??

 Dissapointed

 Painful! This was like watching a Lifetime Channel tv series on the big screen and it was just horrible

 An Honest Review

 Queen or PRE-teen???

 An insult to the memory of Mercury

 Freddie or Adam Lambert

 Movie Sucks

 The most overrated film of 2018

 Reality check 19 reviews lowest is 8 most are 10s

 Yuck

 Wrong Choice

 Worst movie i have ever seen

 Nonsence

 Freddy Mercury was a Mary Sue

 Very superficial, but still worth it

 Boring, don't waste your time.
