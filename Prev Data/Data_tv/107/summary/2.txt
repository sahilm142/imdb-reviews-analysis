 Why is over 7 rating for this ????

 New "Vision" Lacked Entertainment

 Less than impressed

 Ghastly and over rated!

 Is "Battlestar Galactica" about people or events?

 5:0 for cylons!

 Same old fantasy

 The miniseries & season 1 are good... And then it epically slides downhill into a steaming pile of crap
