 Average revenge film with an extremely weak payoff

 Revenge: a dish best eaten live?

 I liked it but...

 Stylish, Violent but Empty

 Not THAT good, not THAT bad either

 Movie, not very good

 Intriguing mix of "Memento" meets "Payback" by way of "Chinatown"

 Savage Plot Saved by Imagery and Sound

 an unusual yet mesmerizing revenge fable

 Vertigo

 Mixed

 Fun, but ultimately flawed

 Pretty good but slightly overrated

 a nice experiment in film but ultimately too contrived to be great

 A pulp movie, full of original twists and some defects. See it.

 Was there really a plot twist ?

 Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride

 Violence isn't just skin deep

 Film without Mercy

 Keeping it in the family

 A fest of excesses- certainly not for everyone

 Sophocles did it earlier, and better.

 Pretty good, but could be great

 What can I say ?

 An interesting and enjoyable film.
