 Children's Fairy tale in Space

 I can't believe this is so popular! (No Offense)

 Perhaps the most overrated film of all time

 The 1st/4th film in the Star Wars saga

 it remains a classic of its genre...

 The most overrated movie of all time.

 One of the most overrated films

 I don't understand all the fuss.

 Irritating, self-important, dated, with some bright moments

 Overrated

 It was an ambitious film, but no payoff...

 Really not worth the fuss

 Vastly Over rated, but fun to watch

 an imaginative piece of work.

 Special effects centered film that shows its age

 Not aging well

 Not bad, but one of the most over-rated

 Good story line disguised by special effects overload.
