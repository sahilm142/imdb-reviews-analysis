 A Touching Story of Loyalty and Love

 Touching and sensitive film based on a heartwarming true story happened in Japan

 Good movie, a dog's loyalty to his master, no drugs, sex, or bad language.

 Not a great film but, a beautiful story even if tragic

 Surprisingly better than the original

 A Highly-Rated Richard Gere Movie

 Always by your side

 Extremely manipulative

 A Decent Interpretation of a True Story

 Upsetting AND annoying

 It's hard to hate a cute doggy film...

 Good Film I am sure but...

 How I Tried to Resist this film....

 Review for 'Hachiko: A Dog's Story'

 A heart-warming tale...

 Hachito

 A real tear jerker from a simple premise

 Dull characters, but the dog is darn cute

 Hachi-Tearjerker, and One Missed Mark ***

 Dog really is man's best friend... in life and beyond death!
