 Awful... Really awful.

 I guess watching paint dry can be Oscar material

 The original version is better

 The Untalented

 Save your money

 can you spell "deus ex machina"?

 Infernal Affairs is better

 Movies script is made up of continual cursing.

 Self-indulgent, Overrated & Bloated

 Come on! Where is the logic of it all? (Spoiler warning)

 Disappointed

 enjoyable yet terrible

 THIS won an Oscar? Any Oscar?

 Nothing compared to the Hong Kong original!

 major let down

 not a patch on INFERNAL AFFAIRS

 Inferior Remake

 Everyone shoots everyone. ooops I gave away the plot!

 Another "Sympathy" Oscar

 Too slow and boring

 A film filled with unnecessary and nihilistic violence and profanity

 Bad acting, non-existent character development, confusing plot.

 The Departed is rubbish, go watch Infernal Affairs instead!

 Just as the nay sayers said

 Am I the only one?!
