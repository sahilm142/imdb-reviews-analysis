I find it strange that "The seventh Seal" has always been widely considered to be the best Bergman movie and is so much more famous that all the others he made. Yes, it's very good, especially for its time, but compared with the real masterpieces Bergman made like "Wild Strawberries", "Through a Glass darkly", "Persona", "Winter light" and "Fanny and Alexander", it really pales in comparison. The ideas and the questions asked in this movie are pretty interesting and profound, but I feel that Bergman has done so much better in his later movies on similar subjects. The theme about the God's silence is much, much better developed in the famous "Faith Trilogy", especially "Through a glass darkly" and "Winter light". The theme about how to cope with fear of death is well developed, but couldn't really convince me. Also I feel that the film has too many "comic relief" moments.  Many people have praised the cinematography in this movie, quite a few saying that it's one of the best ever. I beg to disagree. It's very, very good, excellent at times, but again Bergman has done so much better in his other movies. Personally I feel that the cinematography in Bergman's movies improved when he changed his director of photography Gunnar Fischer(who worked on this movie and "Wild Strawberries") with Sven Nykvist. Watch "Through a glass darkly" or "Persona" if you want a really stunning cinematography. But even "Wild Strawberries", made shortly after "The Seventh seal" and looking visually quite similar, is better IMO. Here the settings and the lighting looks too theatrical to me for most of the times. Of course, there were quite a few memorable images, especially the start with Death on the beach, the dance with Death at the end, the procession of the fanatics who whipped themselves through the village,etc. But still, something was lacking in many of the scenes. Bergman had to shoot the whole movie in just 35 days, so it's understandable IMO. After being so critical to the movie so far, it's time to mention its strong points. They are typical of Bergman's movies. Very strong acting(especially from Max von Sydov), amazing dark medieval atmosphere, really makes you think about the important questions. The music was very well and effectively used too. It's a great movie, no doubt, and it established Bergman as one of the all-time greats, which is big plus for a huge fan of him like myself. Still, my advice is: don't limit your Bergman experience to just this movie, watch his others, many of them are even better. 9/10


                
I will firstly begin by stating that my full thoughts for this film could not be summed up in a review. I am finding it hard to elucidate my thoughts on a film that constantly has you in a moral struggle. In fact, The Seventh Seal is one of those films that can thrust you into a continual cycle of new interpretations and insight into what "it" all means. There is a level of profundity and simplicity established that few films prior had been able to capture nor have been able to match since.The Seventh Seal is about a disillusioned man, Antonious Block, seeking to discover answers to life, death and the existence of God as he plays a game of chess against Death during the Black Plague. I found the premise alone highly original and intriguing. Factor in that this was one of the chef-d'<U+009C>uvres of acclaimed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman and it had sufficed me. This film, while overt at times, is subtle in displaying small moments of beauty – a beautiful shot of a squirrel appearing on the top of a cut-off tree trunk, the moon glimmering as dusk falls rapidly. In a film oozing with metaphysical thoughts, these moments are cleverly placed, perhaps imperatively so, to remind the audience of the consolation in appreciating all the small beauty that arises in life. Akin to the usage of the river in "Apocalpyse Now", The Seventh Seal uses the chess game as a setting of both a literal and metaphorical journey – a connecting link that will be able to guide the flow of the storytelling. Antonious will embark on a journey that, like a chess game, will see him analyze, reflect and understand as he tries to approach some kind of closure for his ambiguity. The inherently glacial nature of a chess game will allow Antonious's journey through his past to be broadened and fulfilling.The pacing in the Seventh Seal was slow at times, with many lulls present amidst the storytelling, making it less watchable for some. And yet, often it was these pauses, somber and still, that sparked the most introspective moments in a film that was constantly in pursuit of answers. The film's brilliant cinematography personifies the emotions of its characters and their surroundings – dark, sinister, powerless. It is able to heighten the viewing experience by becoming that much more vivid, thought-provoking and perceptive.There is a very interesting long shot following the death of Raval, the discourteous theologian, where the camera actually stops, without any edits or movements for roughly 15 seconds. It feels like there is a freeze in time for that duration. It is so silent, eerily so, and, in those 15 seconds, a lot can be interpreted. Pauses in the story can be effectively used to give the audience, amidst all of the eccentricities, a moment to reflect about the themes being discussed at hand, something I am sure Bergman was fully cognizant of. Ambient sounds like a crackling fire or the whirling wind can be heard during a monologue. This film masterfully captures the smaller details others would neglect and in doing so presents much greater possibilities of its intended message.
***SPOILERS*** Traveling back to his castle in Scandinavia Christian Knight Antonius Block, Max Von Sydow, has seen enough death and horror in the Crusade that he went on into the Holy Land, where he fought the last ten years. The Crusades took almost all the faith that he had in man as well as his belief in God out of him. Together with his squire, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Block found that his native land as well as the whole of Western Europe is being ravaged by the Black Plague that's destroying even more lives that the Crusades. Block begins to wonder if the plague is God's retribution to man for the evils that he committed over the centuries. Block and his squire have another person traveling with them through the hills and forests and along the coast of Sweden and he was with them throughout their entire journey back home from the hell-fires of the Middle-East Death, Bengt Ekerot. Sensing who he is when Block sees him at the seashore he knows that his time has come but talks him into playing him a game of chess to for stall his eventual demise. Even more to get from Death the knowledge about good and evil and the existence of a God before he ends up at the tip of the Grim Reaper's scythe. The chess game goes on and off throughout the movie "The Seventh Seal" and as long as Block stays in the game he stays alive as well as those who he picked up with him in his going back home to his castle where his lovely wife Karin, Inga Lanogre, is waiting for him. Beautifully and eerily photographed and directed by Igmar Bergman "The Seventh Seal" show us how we can be deceived into thinking that what were told is good can easily turn out to be evil, by those whom we trust and believe in. Like in the case of the many thousands of men like Block who believed enough to be willing to give up their lives for it. Later in the film we see Raval, Bertil Anderbern, stealing the gold and silver jewelry off the dead to enrich himself. Raval was the local religious leader who's fiery speeches to go to Jerusalem and drive the unbelievers out of that holy city and the entire holy land. Reduced to being a Godless grave-robber and unfeeling liar Raval ends up falling victim to the very horror that he profited from in stealing from the dead: the plague. As it begins to look that Death is slowly winning his game of chess with Block and the end is almost near for him he in desperation goes to talk to this young woman, Maud Hansson, who's about to be burned at the stake for being a witch by the local townspeople. Block trying to find out if it's true that she can see and even communicate with the Devil feeling that if the Devil exists God has to exist too. Since one can't exist without the other. Mercyfully giving her a potion that would ease her pain from the torch and fire thats about to engulf her all Block gets from the woman is a mindless and empty stare as she awaits the horror thats about to end her short and so mournful life. "The Seventh Seal" is considered my many to be Bergmans best film and since he made it back in 1956 he never came close to making another motion picture, with the many fine movies that he made over the years since then, as good as it was and still is even now. The movie not only makes you wonder if there's any truth that God as well as good and evil exists but also makes you think about yourself and that final journey into the dark and great unknown that we all eventually will have to travel.


                
As with any film of this type it will appeal to some, but many people will not understand the imagery. So while this film is in many top 100 lists this does not necessarily mean you will enjoy it. This film caused much controversy when it was released, and still to this day, because of its anti-god and anti-religious views. For instance, the only divine being that we ever see is death. The character of death is well written and well acted, and scenes he is in a very memorable. The film can be very boring and seemingly shallow when you are not fully analysing every image, but if you think that it is not a bad film it is just a film that you will not enjoy, no matter how many times you rematch it. The camera-work though is very memorable, and I really like that the camera always still. It makes the world feel more empty, and this is really absorbing. My final impression on the film is mixed. I love the character of death, and I love the isolated feel of the world, but the film does have section where the film just slows down and even lacks memorable images, which is exactly what the film tries to achieve. I also do not like the massive character list, which makes the film feel stuffed and the 95 minute runtime means that each character has virtually no character development. I still recommend you watch it though.
This new digital transfer was created from a new 35mm fine-grain master positive made from the restored camera negative. The Swedish sound was created from a 35mm magnetic audio track. The new transfer was then completely restored by hand-removing most imperfections utilizing the MTI Digital Restoration System. The trailer was created from a composite 35mm print.The commentary by Peter Cowie is wonderful. It explains all of the imagery and symbolism used by Ingmar Bergman. It is worth re-watching the entire movie for!!


                
Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, "The Seventh Seal" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, "The Seventh Seal" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: "I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me," he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (Åke Fridell), squire Jöns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.


                
A masterpiece. No doubt about it.It was my first Bergman film, and I was a bit anxious, as his works are considered difficult, and deeply psychological. And it's true, but this one has such an amazing mood that you're in it within few minutes.Some of the images will stay in your mind forever: the frightening parade of the ascetics, the eyes of the dying witch, empty village. But what is amazing is that Bergman within this dark and pessimistic movie managed to put lighter elements (conversation between Antonius and the actors at the sunset) or even humorous (seduction of blacksmith's wife, Death cutting down the tree), which make "The Seventh Seal" more absorbing. He put two opposites: cynical and pessimistic Jons and Antonius versus Jof and his family, common people who live a simple life, and therefore are close to God (Jof has visions of the Virgin Mary); and somehow gives answers to Antonius' questions.If you don't know any of Bergman's films start with this one. It's not his best, but the best for newcomers.9/10


                
The young intellectual's standard introduction to "very serious cinema" holds up quite well. "The Seventh Seal" remains a compelling story at the same time that it treats huge philosophical questions with insight and drama.  It's just as puzzling, intriguing, provocative and challenging to the 40 year old as it was to the 20 year old.


                
This is a strange movie--period! However, it is also one of the most parodied films and for that reason alone it is worth seeing! Now, on to explain the part that is parodied: A man is returning from war in the time of the Reformation and the plague is about the countryside. The man meets the Angel of Death and is told it is him time to die. The man asks if he can first challenge him in a game of chess--if the man wins, then his life will be spared. The Grim Reaper, not wanting to be a spoilsport, agrees and they play a game that starts and stops again and again. This exact same contest has been used in Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, the cartoon series The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and an experimental film De Düva: The Dove (starring Madeline Kahn among others). In the Bill and Ted movie, they did not play chess but a series of games including Battleship and Twister! In The Dove, it was a badminton game! I can't remember what the game was in the cartoon series, but instead of their deaths, the children played the Grim Reaper over the soul of their pet hamster! Isn't is weird how this art film has appeared again and again and in the silliest of places! Give it a try to see the FIRST death-match and because it is a good film--with excellent performances all around--from Max Von Sydow to all the supporting players. Also, do not give up on the film too quick--I did and only saw it all years later when my sister-in-law convinced me to give it another try!


                
The Seventh Seal is a truly unique film.  Few movies have successfully taken such a direct approach to the questions of life and death.  Rather than subtly hide it in some other story, Bergman creates a character who openly wonders about these questions.A knight, Antonious Block (Max von Sydow) is returning to his native Sweden from the crusades.  Finding his land in the midst of plague, and thinking about what he saw in the crusades, he begins to wonder about life, death, god, and so on.  He meets death, who has come to take him. He challenges death to a game of chess - if he wins, he goes free, and if death wins, he takes him.Technically, this movie is magnificent.  The lighting, the camera angles - everything is superb.  It is a masterpiece simply as a period film. Everything from the sets to the costumes is top notch.  The setting of the film - medieval Europe suffering from the plague  - is well suited for to handle the themes portrayed in the film.Most of the film is symbolic and allegorical.  It features little action, but rather contemplation and questioning.  While it is not what I would describe as accessible, it is certainly more accessible and entertaining than most of its kind.  Highly recommended for anybody who questions death and our existence, not for somebody who wants to see lots of blood and explosions.**** out of ****


                
Back from the Crusades (where he no doubt carried out some unspeakable acts in the name of God) Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), discovers his homeland ravaged by the plague as he struggles with a crisis of faith. As if that wasn't bad enough, he also runs into Death on the beach, and challenges the reaper to a game of chess to buy himself a little time as he wrestles with metaphysical conundrums. The duel, played on a beach beneath lowering skies, provides us with one of cinema's enduring images and, perhaps, misleads us about the true nature of Bergman's film. I'd always assumed it to be a grim, dour affair with dull, lengthy periods of intellectualising. Well, the film is certainly bleak, but it's also completely absorbing and rewarding.Block travels the countryside with his squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and finds on his journey a country in the grip of a religious fervour that promises nothing but damnation and offers precious little in the way of comfort. Burnings and ritualistic acts of flagellation are carried out in the name of a God who is conspicuously absent, which does nothing to help Block resolve his inner torment. They meet up with a number of characters: Jof (Nils Poppe), a juggler, his pretty wife Mia (Bibi Andersson) and their small son Mikael; Plog (Ake Fridell), a blacksmith whose wife has absconded with the leader of the tiny travelling theatre of which Jof and Mia make up two-thirds; a girl saved by Block's squire from Raval, an evil former monk who, ten years before, duplicitously persuaded the squire to join the Crusades and who ultimately comes to a distasteful end. Each gives Death an opportunity to add them to his list as they encounter one another on various routes that ultimately lead to the estate of Block and the wife he hasn't seen in ten years.The bleakness of the film is offset by the endlessly fascinating scenarios created by Bergman – many of the incidents are inspired by a mural the director would study as a child while attending his preacher father's lengthy sermons – and a flavourful taste of the dark ages. Block's crisis is always the motivating force behind the story and the incidents that take place within it, but is never allowed to dominate or control. As Block searches for some sign of God all he witnesses is the devil's work. He questions a young girl sentenced to burn for sleeping with the devil and bringing the plague down upon the countryside. He asks her if the devil exists, for he must surely know God. 'Look into my eyes,' the girl replies, 'The priest and the soldiers could see him there. They wouldn't touch me.' 'I see nothing but terror.' Block remarks, and you can feel his desolation.The subject of God, his existence, and the ways in which his presence is made known to us, were an abiding obsession with Bergman, and formed the core of many of his films (comedies aside). This, one of his earliest films, is by far the most direct in its probing, as is probably befitting of a young director at the beginning of his career. For this same reason it is probably also one of his most accessible films. Even those untroubled by the questions that obsessed Bergman so completely, should find enough going on to take something away from the film.As The Seventh Seal begins with an iconic image, it also ends with another: Death, carrying his scythe and leading his party of seven on a macabre dance against a brooding sky. It was a spur of the moment decision to film it, and exists only because Bergman and his cameraman were taken by a dramatic cloud formation in the distance. In fact the decision was so impulsive that the figures aren't the actors at all, but members of the crew and a couple of curious tourists.


                
This is one of those movies, like Seven Samurai, where you watch it for the first time, following one character, and suddenly not-quite-midway through you realize that every character is important and intricately linked into the progression and exposition of the story and themes, so you know before you've even finished that you need to watch it again.One of the more blatantly philosophical films out there (which is a good thing in this case, by the way, don't think that I'm using the term "blatant" as a negative indicator), Ingred Bergman's The Seventh Seal basically is a contemplation on Death. I'm sure you've read that already, on the back of the Criterion DVD box, on the synopsis written for it at any site where it's listed, in the many reviews, both critical and mundane, and everywhere that even mentions this movie.So I'm not going to go so much into the focus of the characters on Death, as it were, because you know it all already, even if you haven't seen it. Instead what I'll focus on is the idea of presenting Death or, roughly, imaging him. One of the key things that sets the events in this movie off is that the knight asks Death to play chess and, when Death asks him how he knows he likes chess, the knight answers, "I saw it in a painting." Throughout this movie are shown many different artists, philosophers, and people trying to present what Death is and looks like via different media such as painting, theatre, prayer, actions, and discussions, and yet the main memorable image of this film is precisely the distinctive image of Death himself, the man with the thin lips and large forhead who holds his arm out to envelop on the front cover of the Criterion DVD. A film that invests its interest in Death needs a way of presenting him in a way that isn't completely stuck in the inspirations of other presentations, else focusing an entire work on Death becomes merely repetitious to what has all been said before. Thus we have a very original and thus very compelling image of Death that becomes the inspiration instead of just being an amalgamation of other's ideas.Thus this movie brilliantly shows Death personified and characterized without holding all the dialog towards Death as a person but Death as a force. By showing that other people "draw" Death in various forms and different symbolic ways, the subjective viewpoint of who Death is is reinforced without having to be stated, which can be condescending.Then we are so pleasantly allowed to sit back and watch the other characters all invest their energy into their ideas of Death, to mix them together and come up with a complete idea of how Death affects us profoundly and psychologically.--PolarisDiB


                
After spending ten years in the holy land fighting in the Crusades, the knight Antonious Block and his squire Jöns return to Sweden. However, instead of a warm homecoming, a country that is being ravaged by the Black Plague instead greets the two men.While resting at a beach, Antonious is visited by Death who says that the time has come for the knight's life to end. However, Antonious is not ready for his life to end. It is not because he is afraid of death, but because he wants to gain knowledge of God. With his faith hampered by ten tears fighting in the crusades and by the fact that his countrymen are rotting to death because of the plague Antonious wants to discover if God truly exists or not. Therefore, in order to gain some time, Antonious challenges Death to a game of chess that the two play throughout the film.The main struggle within Bergman's film is the conflict one feels when one wants to have faith in God in times of trouble, however, because God is silent and lets his people suffer one truly wonders if such a God truly exists. However, because one has believed in the God for his or her entire life, one cannot extract go from one's heart and mind thereby making one's wavering faith a source of pain and conflict instead of the bastion of hope it had once been.A slow, meditative film, The Seventh Seal brings to the fore the extremes some people will go to in times of strife. With its depictions of flagellates, those who beat themselves in order to repent for their sins, and witch burnings the film is obviously not a very happy film, but it is one that will make one think of the unknown and whether or nor within this vast unknown is there anything there or is it empty?


                
The best thing about a really cryptic movie is that it can fork numerous interpretations. This is what I thought the movie meant.The time is up for every major character in the movie. Jof, Mia and Mikael escape death because Antonius sacrifices his game for their sake thereby distracting death while they escape.Death asks Antonius whether he has made good of his respite for which he answers 'yes'.Earlier in the church he confesses that he wants to use his respite to accomplish one meaningful act. Saving them from death was the meaningful act.Central idea:This movie challenges religion. The reason for the crusades is constantly questioned. In the end it is not God that saves them(Jof,Mia and Mikael) but a mortal(Antonius).In the same line we can see a good deal of time being devoted to show blind beliefs in people(people inflicted with plague flogging themselves, the girl who is burnt).
The film begins, and the sky rises on us, and two people fall near the beach, and while in this silent silence there is a terrifying guest coming to them soon, comes the guest quickly and suddenly, ask the hero of the film Antonius Black who are you? I answer death! This is how the film starts with a shocking and breathtaking scene, a scene that critics have rated as the best opening in the history of cinema. Not surprisingly, they brought together people and death together. The film revolves around the return of the crusader Antonius Block to his country, Which leads people to believe that the resurrection has approached and became imminent, and then goes to Antonius great battle with the self in an attempt to search for answers about life and man, and the Great God!
My story with this film is long, and it started two years ago. At that time I was bored to the limit of those classic and traditional Hollywood and European films. I was looking for films about life, dramatic human and philosophical films. , I saw the film for the first time and did not like it, I grew up in Bergman Cinema and watched its greatest movies and then became very familiar with the ideas and films of this man, I saw the film again, and it became the second best film I have ever seen! , This is the Bergman Cinema, the films of this man are different from all the films, and my words are only evidence that Bergman Cinema and others contain a great deal of ideas and novels deep, and certainly will not appreciate his work in just one view.
I love Bergman,
Film Review: "The Seventh Seal" (1957)The character of Antonius Block the crusader, shipwrecked, returning from the meaningless war-mongering crusades over belief in Jerusalem, portrayed in dignified, power-striving manner by Max von Sydow as the last knight, swept onto the shores of an unidentified island with his squire, well-studied and life-taking by the horns performance by actor Gunnar Björnstrand (1909-1986) confronted death itself in a party of chess in three move-shifting scenes of reminiscencing the divine comedy of life that everything is borrowed and will eventually turn to nothing on death day.Director Ingmar Bergman (1918-2007) double-layers his image system of combining a chessboard with an rising sun over an ocean. It becomes evident that the filmmaking artist is present, who completely thought through his motion picture endeavor from the first written word in form of a stage play to the final premise shot of a dance with death. Further the director uses a group of traveling artists on identifying the circle of life in art to frighten society with images of pain, horror, self-mutilation, cancer, sickness raging war and epidemics to remind spectators of death to believe in dreams again and making the showtime spectacle, a machine to forget about loss and death; where "The Seventh Seal" strikes is in overwriting information with character point-of-view shots, illusionary hallucinations clearly been seen by an character of feeling toward devastating agony or fulfilled bliss where life is beautiful, at least for an hour before another shift comes to cope with a human emotion of inconvenience.The film asks all the essential questions of what life makes worthwhile and death necessary to all, who have lived fully. As the last knight Antonius Block states to death, who has been performed in J.W. Goethe's Faust recalling manner by actor Bengt Ekerot (1920-1971), in final moves of their chess game, "I am the prisoner of my dreams. I am not part of society anymore." Director Ingmar Bergman finds his balance again in concluding his in precision camera work captured picture by Gunnar Fischer (1910-2011) that life stays always life in company of family and death as final member of the company is its reward.© 2017 Felix Alexander Dausend (Cinemajesty Entertainments LLC)


                
If a mainstream film, or any type of film for that matter, were to tackle as many themes and morals as Ingmar Bergman's legendary Seventh Seal, it would most likely be an uneven, unpolished work, and not even come close to the realm of depth this film can accomplish so elegantly and calmly. This is the kind of picture that, when it's done, you want to immediately rewatch it because you know there are things that you missed.Our story concerns a disillusioned knight named Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, who gives one of cinema's finest performances) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), who return home after fighting in the Crusades on an empty, desolate beach. Sweden has been victim to the plague, meaning those that have it are dying right before people's eyes, and those who don't have it are engulfed in fear. It isn't long before Block encounters the personified "Death" (Bengt Ekerot), who appears pale - in a black cloak - much like early, vague illustrations of the Grim Reaper character. Immediately, Block, confused about life and death itself, challenges Death to a game of chess, where if he wins, he will be spared his life.Block and Jöns, en route back to their castle, encounter Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son, Mikael, who are stage actors in a play. From here on out, the film takes us on an unforgettable ride, as we follow both Block and Jöns's journeys throughout the middle age time period and what unfolds than is a rousing commentary on religion, life, and death.The film has the look of a period piece, but with the contents of serene drama and utter bleakness with the nice surprising inclusion of black comedy. The Seventh Seal too asks existential questions about the world around us in a manner that isn't indulgent, and offers many assumptions in its underlying text. Frequently, we see our character, Block, as hopeless and seemingly unimportant in life. He questions religion so much, and with all the mentions of death (even the appearance) we begin to wonder if he is inherently godless or atheistic in his personality.Often, the film provides us with tonal inconsistency, but it has to be the smoothest tonal inconsistency I have yet to experience. It isn't abrupt, and Bergman successfully manages to hold onto the flow of the story, never becoming too tied up with one of the underlying contexts over the other, and is fair and balanced in his work, including much of his dialog which is not cloyingly absent or annoyingly expository. It is perfectly handled and structured with elegance and purity.The Seventh Seal is one of the strongest foreign works of all time, and a film with enough on its plate to develop three or four movies. Ingmar Bergman's sharp director, distinct and graphic writing style, complimented by the cinematography of the great Gunnar Fischer bring the energy, sophistication, and true delight that is The Seventh Seal. And even with all of these heavy topics at hand, never is it depressingly grim or overly optimistic.Starring: Max von Sydow, Gunnar Björnstrand, Bengt Ekerot, and Nils Poppe. Directed by: Ingmar Bergman.


                
THE SEVENTH SEAL is a film that presents a dramatic fantasy game between meaning of life and fear of death. A knight and his squire have returned to their country after a ten-year crusade. Deadly disease ravaged country. Knight faces Death. He calls Death on the multi-day game of chess...The story has touched serious philosophical and religious topics. However, the story is full of intrigue, dark humor and hope. The protagonists are distracted between the vicious disease, self-pity and torture. It is interesting to see a deeply disillusioned knight, a cynical squire who hates women, a cheating wife, evil priests, a mute girl and seemingly healthy and happy family on the same road. The truth is all around them. The main protagonist used to persistently ask questions to which only he has a valid response. This film reveals some controversial issues. Is deadly disease greater threat to man or the man is the greatest enemy to himself? Mr. Bergman has painted realistic effects of fear, horror, cynicism, surprises, love and health on human faces.Max von Sydow as Antonius Block, the knight is a more serious version of Don Quixote. Gunnar Björnstrand Jöns, the squire is a character who never changes his mood. He always has some sort of cynical jokes or words of contempt for each occurrence. Bengt Ekerot is Death in the true sense of that word. Nils Poppe as Jof is a juggler who has strange predictions. Fortunately, no one believes him. Bibi Andersson as Mia, Jof's wife is a beautiful and cheerful woman who does not fit into the landscape.Life is a hard journey. The rare moments of happiness are a sort of salvation. The end of the film emphasizes the transience of life and the power of death which no one can escape. Of course, only in the eyes of one of the protagonists.


                
On the Criterion Collection interview with Ingmar Bergman, he relates that he wrote the chess scene over his own fear of dying. This would have been an immensely interesting idea to explore, but after he mentions it, the interview is practically over. That left me rather frustrated.The film itself may also leave one rather frustrated, as it explores the principal character agonizing over God's unwillingness to show His face and answer his existential questions about the meaning of life and the certainty of death. When Death (Bengt Ekerot) makes his entrance to claim him a victim, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) challenges the Grim Reaper to a game of chess, the winner to exact his own reward. The Knight must quickly readjust his game plan after he unwittingly reveals his strategy to the black clad harvester of souls.The film is set during the time of the Black Plague, following a 'worthless' crusade of ten years that the Knight and his Squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) participated in. All around them are wanderers half crazed with fear at the thought of the Plague approaching. All the time Death appropriates his victims, he claims to know nothing and hold no secrets. Fearing his own demise, Block (Bergman?) disrupts the chess board, intent on prolonging his existence in a world full of uncertainty."The Seventh Seal" is Bergman's stunning allegory of man's search for meaning, but what I've come to understand after many years is that each person must come to terms with himself from within. Attempting to extract answers from a single source is bound to end in disappointment, trapped if you will in a Knight's world of phantoms and dreams more like nightmares. This is the kind of film that presents more questions than answers, as I'm sure Bergman understood and intended.
The Seventh Seal is not for everyone, it is a hard film, the direction is one of the greatest director of all time, Ingmar Bergman, and he drives excellently, your messages in the film are excellent, it fills the message movie philosophical, the dialogues of films are philosophical, the dialogues Gentleman Death are incredible, are the best thing in the film, the cast is very good, especially Max Von Sydow this excellent, and Bengt Ekerot this excellent also as Death , the look of death is simply more very good, photography is excellent and very dark , I found very good the view that Bergman had to make the look of death, the film is a little bizarre at times, has some very strange moments and troublesome, the soundtrack is excellent, the script is very good, the pace has some problems, even if the movie is short, I found some unnecessary moments, and unnecessary characters with dialogues that should not have in the movie, but that does not erase the excellent film, the Seventh Seal is a the best Ingmar Bergman's films (if not the best) has many messages, and strange and memorable moments. Note 9.7


                
This stunningly photographed tale of a knight (the always-reliable Max Von Sydow) returning home from the Crusades is now universally recognized as the film responsible for Ingmar Bergman's international breakthrough. As the knight begins his famous game of chess with Death, the two players start pondering over the meaning of existence and religion. The chess game is bookended continuously by various scenes involving a group of traveling performers. While generally regarded as a drama, the film overlaps into horror and many scenes (the witch-burning; the grotesque processions) have a potent shock value. All the way through, the film retains its menacing atmosphere and the whole movie can actually be viewed as an experimental horror epic.
The Seventh seal is a wonderful movie. A knight's returns home after years. But the most important aspect of his life seems to remain unanswered. He searched for truth and hasn't found it yet and it's getting clear through the film it's not going to happen. The question of the existence of god and the relations of human to him is one the most important issues in history. I think this film should be considered as pictorial manifest of the existentialism. Are we alone in the world or not? Is there any hope to feel the God through our life in any way? This film could happen in our age too, because it has the same questions yet we haven't found. Interestingly, no one will forget the face of death in this movie which was played by Bengt Ekerot. The death only carries out his duties but no one knows is there any one to order him to do that? The knight never find out if god is out there or not even when he asked death about it. The death is not able or allowed to answers to the knight whether anything really exists beyond life or not. If there is emptiness or something else beyond it? What happens then? He remains mysterious and silent about these questions all over the film. I think Ingmar Bergman let us free to judge about these matters and there is no clear answer to them. We are all that knight too who seeking for the truth.It is one of the most interesting movies which I ever saw. Ingmar Bergman has many great ideas to talk about. If some one likes to see a movie which could help him to think more about himself and the world around him, I suggest this film.Also the power of humanity is evident in this film. At the end of the film we see that small family comprised of three who escaped the death and saw the others leaded by the death to the end of their destiny. They are plain and good people which don't have complicated ideas about life. They only want a simple life to live. It's clear they are some how similar to the father, Christ and the holy Mother and this could be one of the reasons why they didn't go with dead. Life goes on <U+0085>


                
I had absolutely no idea what to expect when I rented this from the video shop. I'd never seen a Bergman film before and only knew that they came highly recommended. I went out for the night, came back very late, and thought I'd put the film on for a few minutes before hitting the sack. From the opening scene I was spellbound. An hour and a half later when the credits rolled I had the sensation that I had just watched something truly special. I was captivated by the beautifully constructed, hauntingly quiet scenes and the understated sense of foreboding that lingered throughout. I am pleased I had never before heard of the scenes of the knight playing chess with Death as for me they took me by surprise and were a delight. This is a wonderful film and I'm looking forward to seeing it again soon.


                
There are moments in the Seventh Seal that are as good as anything else in cinema history. Images so striking and memorable that they linger with you always. Moments of dialogue that fit absolutely perfectly that hit you with a sudden power. This film is one of the most poignant reflections on life, death, and Religion. The mood of the film reflects that, moving very swiftly from joy to dark fear.I will say that some of the scenes come across as slightly ridiculous and overblown, and the costumes too haven't aged quite as well as other films, however these are minor criticisms not difficult to overlook. I don't feel the performances are consistent across the board, with some doing much better than others. Despite these criticisms, where it's at it's best, it's truly astounding.


                
Talking specifically about this title we should mention first the serious part, which I see in the deep commitment to God's Word. It is not by chance that the time in which the action takes place is the Middle Ages - as if the only intelligible world of man then was then religious one. And I must mention the burdens finale in which death refers all.Indeed, the theme of death is also central and serious, but as in life - to her we give our last thoughts. The action starts on the beach (a symbol of transition to infinity or origin of life on earth), where the main character causes death, that came for him, at chess. The idea is to win some time to buy someone else's life.Death is presented as a mystery, as the deadline which is pressing and tormenting our conscience. It is difficult to find higher instance before which the protagonist to kneel, to feel guilt. The only time he decided yet to do so, it appeared that confession was before death. So it turns out that actually the manifest was in front of himself, but in his last hour (death).Here eminence is given into the hands of intelligent people and artists, then the religious and finally to the ordinary people. The plague rages in the Middle Ages putting to test the faith of believers and asking questions about the meaning of human existence. However, there are many rays of light, saved young lives, there are people who happily lived their lives. Such people exist today and there will always be.A playful Bergman film which is for true connoisseurs of cinema.
