I simply don't understand. Alright, the animation quality was better than other things that were out at the time, and the music is really good... but seriously, there is no overarching story. NOTHING HAPPENS. They hardly ever get that bounty they are looking for. I just don't get it. Why does this show have the same rating as fullmetal alchemist brotherhood? What the heck am I missing? Maybe it's because I've watched some of the best that anime has to offer, but this is excruciatingly boring and I'm just tired of it. I got to episode 15, more than half-way through the show before I made the decision to quit. I gave it the royal try.
