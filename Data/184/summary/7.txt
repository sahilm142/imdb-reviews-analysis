 Bohemian Rhapsody

 Enjoyable but thin on substance

 Good music movie, bad biography.

 Had to remember it was not a documentary...

 Not quite 'Bohemian Rhapsody', more like 'I'm In Love With My Car': undeniably entertaining but ultimately quite shallow.

 Rami Malek is astounding, so is the final act.

 Watch it for Rami Malek's performance and the music

 It has its moments, but Bohemian Rhapsody lacks the energy and passion that the story deserves

 A die hard Queen fan who can suspend Belief to enjoy what it is

 Good movie against the odds

 Enjoyable movie.

 Queen experience at it's finest

 A significantly different experience if you're not familiar with Queen

 Worth to take a risk

 A Critique on Bohemian Rhapsody

 Damm

 As a fan of Queen i enjoyed this.

 These are the days of our lives

 Nice (albeit too simple) reminder of a musical legend

 The story is a missed opportunity and lowers the overall value

 Great performance by Rami Malek

 This band was Freddie

 Messy pacing, but worthwhile?

 Long live Queen!!
