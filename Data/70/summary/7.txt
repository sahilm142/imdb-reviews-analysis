 I noticed several compared this to "The Godfather"....though I think this is a bit of hyperbole.

 So good and yet so bad

 Beautiful.

 As good as Gangster movies get!

 "Believe in yesterday"

 disappointment

 Vacuous spaghetti eastern

 Good but not great

 Fascinating, beautifully shot and acted but slightly flawed

 it could have been a contender.

 Destination...Nowhere!

 Long duration for so relatively few conflicts

 Mature and reflective film-making

 A realistic gangster story of epic proportions- but slow paced and exposition heavy.

 Gresat historical drama

 Once upon a Time in America

 It takes a long time to tell this story

 Need Help With This One

 Deep story that's still easy to follow.

 Pretty Good

 OUATIA: My view of the movie that is considered as Sergio Leone's masterpiece
