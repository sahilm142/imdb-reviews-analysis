Loved the original show but this one is so focused on the 5 characters that the makeovers are more about them than about the people in need.Grooming guy spends more time talking about and touching his hair than the guy he's there to help. If he's within 1/2 mile of the camera he manages to get his face in there and say something that might make an 8-year giggle. Might.Why do we segue from scene to scene with video of these idiots dancing and mugging at the camera? And how many slo-mo shots do we need of them getting in and out of trucks and flipping their hair around? Who's the audience for this stuff?And what was that business in the mattress store where grooming guy pretended to give birth? This is funny? It was embarrassing and painful to watch. Too bad b/c for all the fakery and camera mugging and forced acting by these 5 there are some genuinely touching moments. By the real folks of course, not by these 5 knuckleheads.Every episode recapped:
-Fashion guy tells them to wear loud, short-sleeved, button-down shirts with the sleeves rolled up
-Grooming guy tells them to use sunscreen and moisturize
-Design guy frantically looks for another acting gig while an off-screen team remodels the home
-Culture guy tells them they're amazing and if they only loved themselves as much as these 5 love them then life will be perfect
-Food guys buys an avocado
