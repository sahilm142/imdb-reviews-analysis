Impractical Jokers is a Candid Camera style hidden camera show mixed with Jackass.Q, Murr, Sal and Joe are four comedians and friends that take part in scenarios or challenges and are told by the others (via hidden earpiece) what to say and do impromptu. Filming takes place in and around New York City.In order to maintain a bad taste threshold the guys can reject lines or scenes that they think are offensive or politically incorrect.Whoever loses the most dares or rejects the most has to carry out a forfeit.The show has been running for several years. You would have thought despite airing in a cable channel, many members of the public would recognise this comedy troop by know. I think there is a lot of television manipulation going on, the faker kind in my opinion.The guys have an easy charm and they look to be enjoying themselves when carrying out the pranks and seeing the audience reactions. However the laughter seemed to be grating, maybe even forced. They laughed more than we the audience as far as I am concerned. I think my daughter remarked that 'it is nice they find it so funny because I did not think it was that hilarious.'


                
At least that's what Skylar Grey sang in, "Final Warning." I have no idea why this quartet has not been beat up, sued or seriously hurt doing their pranks. I thought some of the pranks Amir and Streeter that they did to each other were brutal- and dangerous- but this is times 10. They have some hilarious tame clips like the time they were supposed to be teaching a telemarketing class and pretending to be Subway employees, but then they have truly tasteless pranks, even for cable. I constantly have to tell my daughter to turn it off when they get to some of their more off- color jokes. It obviously entertains a lot of people, but I won't be sad when it goes. Bring back harmless and tame prank shows like Hidden Camera!
