 The Wilder Monroe

 Maybe not the greatest ever but still quite good

 Cutting Edge, 1959

 A film that will always endure the test of time

 I'm not a natural blonde

 ahead of its time and well cast

 It's pretty hot.

 Beautiful Marilyn Monroe...

 Solid comedy

 Fair enough

 Pure Marilyn

 Not the funniest film ever made, but essential viewing

 Very funny!

 No movie is that perfect.

 A Classic But Not Best Comedies of All time

 Screenplay and chemistry is what still stacks up.

 Very Funny

 Good, But Not One of the Greatest Comedies of All Time

 An entertaining movie despite it's age

 Charming but way overated.

 average movie

 Music and the mob don't mix

 Good for one time watch

 Nobody is perfect but the trio is close to that (dvd)

 Overrated...a 20 minute joke stretched to fit 2 hours+
