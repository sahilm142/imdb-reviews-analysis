 Easily the most overrated series ever to air on television ...

 The most overrated show on television! No doubt!

 Is this a kid's show?

 What has Cartoon Network become?...

 I hate Adventure Time

 Pretentious, nerdy and overrated, perfect hipster material

 It Doesn't Do Erratic Humor Right

 Absolute trash! No redeeming value whatsoever.

 Fell off just like any other CN show nowadays
