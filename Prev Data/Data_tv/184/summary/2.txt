 Hannibal: An honest review

 Wow, the FBI is 3 guys and a few nut cases

 Pretentious and vile

 Still not convinced

 Absolute pretentious crap

 Move along, nothing to see here

 Just.. Bad.

 This show goes too far

 Has anyone read the BOOKS??????

 Poor man's True Detective.

 Self indulgent, shallow and pretentious

 Hannibal the series

 Good story

 Common sense is missing

 CSI tries to do Dexter

 Sad and puerile
