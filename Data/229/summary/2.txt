 It does what a horror movie should do

 Perhaps the greatest suspense film ever

 Intense claustrophobia

 Macabre and depressing story makes for somber viewing

 The Devil You Say

 An inspector calls

 Important, but not that shocking anymore

 What a disappointment. (CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS)

 Tightly written and paced suspense drama with a huge twist you can easily swallow...

 you know it

 Maybe in 1955 . . .

 The keys in the pool, the husband in the morgue! You dream too much about water in this house!

 Goes hand in hand with "Psycho"

 Not very suspenseful, but not bad.

 Water, water, everywhere

 Turn off the lights and turn on this movie!!
