 Perfection in a miniseries

 The Latter Trial of the Century with Problematic Casting Choice

 Almost perfect

 Ticks all the right boxes.

 A must-watch

 A Complete Package

 Grippingly fantastic

 Amazing and Amazingly done!

 Near-perfect recreation and dramatization of real events.

 Completes the whole picture.....

 One of the most realistic docu-dramas on the Case of the Century!

 He obviously did it

 A Gripping, Insightful Look at a True Story

 A must-see for anyone who knows this trial

 WOW!

 Breath taken

 Absolutely stunning and worth your time!!!!

 A steaming pile of low grade manure.

 Masterpiece

 This show is a whitewash of Robert Kardashian

 Bad performances, typical Made For TV series

 Marred by a casting mistake and a bad performance for the ages

 Worth it

 Something makes this show not keeping its promises
