This is a movie which clearly takes itself very seriously. Unfortunately, non-Turkish viewers will be left wondering what the point was.It's long, slow, mawkish, melodramatic, clichéd, hackneyed and silly at turns.The main character is apparently some noble mountain bandit, who is perhaps a well-known figure in Turkish mythology, but for someone not familiar with the back story, he's not particularly compelling.The secondary character who becomes his sort of adopted son, is a blow-hard, foolish, boring drug-dealing low-level would-be gangster.None of the relationships are the slightest bit compelling, and the Bandit's behavior is odd but not particularly interesting.The ending does contain some fireworks (literally), but the foolishness of the plot, the shallowness of the characters, the poor special effects (red paint instead of even slightly believable blood), and the long-winded slowness of the movie make it barely watchable and completely unnecessary.Perhaps some insights into the Turkish psyche can be obtained by watching this stinker. After all, they seem to think it's a great movie so something about it must move them.But if you're looking for artistic cinema, or even a bit of entertainment, look elsewhere.


                
This is one of the worst movies ever made. It looks like a low budget indie movie. I can't put into words how bad this is. The plot is pointless, the directing and editing are terrible. The worst part is acting though. It's so bad that will make you laugh. The last 20 minutes are the worst piece of cinema I've ever seen in my life. The Room by Tommy Wiseau is a much better movie in every aspect. I wonder how this got into the IMDB Top 250. I'm not the kind of user who rates 1 out of 10 every movie he doesn't find great, this is actually the first time I give a 1/10. If a movie from my country was this bad, I'd never give it such high ratings just because of that reason.
