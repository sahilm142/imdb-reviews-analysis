 Raiders Of The Last Crusade.

 Probably The Best Movie Of The Trilogy.

 Movie Magic!

 A Marvelous Adventure, On Par with "Raiders," That Adds Depth to the Jones Family Mythos

 "Is this a film?"- No, its a masterpiece in terms of film

 My Favorite of the Series

 Spellbinding and magical.

 The Most Action-Packed of the Series

 great movie

 I was a film extra

 Great movie, my favorite of the franchise

 Great work by "Ford" and " Spielberg".

 Indiana Jones' Last Crusade is Pure Escapist Entertainment!

 my childhood

 A return to form for the Indiana Jones Trilogy

 Best Out Of The Indiana Jones Series!!

 A must view !

 Not nearly as excellent as the first film, but a solid improvement over Temple of Doom

 Last decent Jones film

 Another satisfying adventure, which redeemed the franchise after "Temple of Doom"

 Adventure Movie with Philosophical Questions

 Impressive

 Great Adventure Movie

 Father and Son , Best Tandem on screen
