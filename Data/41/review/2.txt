Caught The Departed last night and I have to say, its one abject failure of a remake. I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police, replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).Where do I even begin? There are just so many things to criticize about. Firstly, the utterly realistic characters in Infernal Affairs have been reduced to one dimensional vectors that merely carry the plot forward. Matt Damon's character was reduced to a bad ass villain and was almost gleefully ridding anyone who knew of his identity, with no hint of remorse even till the very end. In Infernal Affairs however, at the end of the film, Andy Lau truly wanted to be a good guy but obviously, circumstances did not allow him to, and therefore he was forced to kill the gang boss to protect his identity. He subsequently went crazy over the guilt of killing the police informant (Tony Leung, or Leornado in Departed). Infernal Affairs ended brilliantly because Andy Lau's character survived it all with no one knowing his true identity. He could therefore assume his role of a high-ranking police officer, but was ridden with guilt and constantly reminded of the people who died because of him. It was really tragic and you could almost sympathize with his character. And what's with the ending of The Departed?!! Do all Hollywood films have to have perfect fairy tale endings where the bad guy has to die? And even if he has to die, does it have to conclude with an abrupt scene that lasts 30secs, and not to mention, totally cheesy and lame. It seems like a quick way out to conclude the story. The climax at the lift in the abandoned building was also unintentionally funny as body counts skyrocketed as people just started dying ridiculously. The reaction that people had in that scene in Infernal Affairs was true shock<U+0085>'Oh my god!'. The reaction in Departed was quite the opposite <U+0096> people started laughing.Also, the strange and awkward friendship between the police informant's boss and the gang boss was completely removed in the Departed. It was so enjoyable watching how the 2 former friends who are currently on opposite ends of the law, try to outplay each other in a full-fledged war of wits and power, but with grace as a result of their friendship in the past. This was COMPLETELY omitted in the Hollywood version. And also, there was a lack of tension between the police force and the gangs. Martin Sheen seems almost weak and hapless against Jack Nicholson and Nicholson himself appears barely sinister and intelligent. Another stupid omission was the friendship between the police informant and his boss, which was meticulously staged in Infernal Affairs, and culminated in a tragic climax when the boss fell off the building and landed right in front of the informant. This scene was attempted in Departed but failed miserably when Leornado tried to look sad when his boss died. There was no friendship to speak of between these 2 characters in Departed!!!The movie also tries way too hard to entertain. The crazy antics of Jack Nicholson is reminiscent of his character in Anger Management. Yes, Anger management, that rubbish of a comedy. And I do not understand why there are so much sexual references in the movie. There is sex, women and porno everywhere in the movie and is completely unnecessary and downright insulting. Gritty realism is not achieved by dumping sex scenes in the movie.I can go on and on and criticizing about almost every single aspect in the movie (like how unnecessary the role of the psychiatrist in the Departed was, but completely pivotal in Infernal Affairs etc.), and might as well write a thesis on this movie. To conclude, there was not a single scene of tension nor was it ever moving or exciting. In fact, i found it more funny than anything else. The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast. Infernal Affairs was an intricate and convoluted plot of deceit, lies, friendship, paranoia and love, at the hands of skillful directors who carefully stage memorable scenes and powerful climaxes <U+0096> almost everything that Departed was not, despite an almost identical script. The critics are REALLY WRONG on this one. It is a complete failure of a remake, and even without comparison to the original Hongkong version, it is still a ridicule of an otherwise excellent plot. The editing was also fragmented and confusing, and coupled with horrendous pacing, the film gets progressively frustrating. Martin Scorsese has effectively removed everything that was so good about the original. Trust me, save your money and time, and watch Infernal Affairs, even if you have watched it already.
I have never been more disappointed in a movie in my life. A great twist in a movie is one like "the Usual Suspects", where there were clues to the deception. In this film, the twists were just thrown out in mid air. Also, the entire "love story" angle was useless. Finally, having 3 or 4 or 5 endings was ridiculous. Sorry, one more thing, so who was the good guys, who are we rooting for? I wanted to love this movie so bad. But I wound up hating it. Sorry. One example of a useless scene. Jack Nicholson is in a porn movie theater and finds Matt Damon. Now, Matt Damon has essentially lived his life to protect and serve "mobster" Nicholson. What does Nicholson do? Threaten to take away his girlfriend. How I will never know? Then advise him he is not doing enough for him. HUH??????? Damon was so loyal to Nicholson you would have thought he was his father. Just another example of a scene where the writer and director tried too hard and simply failed.
Scorcese has lost it, between this movie and Gangs of New York and the George Harrison documentary. The movie is way too long, poorly edited, dialogue ugh, I just don't get the hype. Must be the violence.Nobody acts in this movie, it's Nicholoson, Sheen, Baldwin, and Damon being themselves. DiCaprio I give an A for effort. The female psychologist roles is the worst. I couldn't sit through this and I am from Boston. Unless you are a cell phone salesman. This reminds me of Crash all the mainstream media fell in loves with a "Scorcese Gangsta Film" how he can go wrong.The Oscars, the media, the brainwashing.


                
I went along to see this after seeing various reviews, all of which said that this was a return to form for Scorcese etc... I was very disappointed. The casting has got to be one of the worst things about it. WTF is Ray Winstone doing in this film? Mostly spoiling it, along with Mark Wahlberg and David O'Hara. Their accents are really, really bad. The script itself had some good parts, had they been given to well-chosen actors they may have been more believable. The only thing I got any enjoyment out of was Matt Damon getting punched several times by Leo DiCaprio, whose performance in this film was the only highlight I can think of. He is definitely improving with age. Its also too long and upon leaving the cinema, all I heard were dissatisfied grumbles, no-one seemed to enjoy it and some people walked out before the end. I endured it hoping the conclusion would make up for the rest of it, but it didn't. Not a return to form in my opinion at all.
Scorsese isn't what he used to be and as a Scorsese lover this pains me to say so. He must have sat down watched Goodfellas and thought 'hmmm. What did I used to do that made me great? I'll just copy that.' It's Scorsese imitating himself and not doing a very good job of it. The editing is quick and choppy like in Goodfellas but too much so the whole film is like one big montage with very little innovative direction. DeCaprio and Damon aren't great but neither are they bad, they just suffice. The actors that really shine are Mark Walberg, who finally ditches the breathless, confused moron he usually plays and does something way different and innovative with himself. Alec Baldwin is fantastic he has some of the best lines and is an actor who just seems to be getting better with age. Normally I'd say the same for Jack who's performance in 'As Good As It Gets', was groundbreaking but this time he's just playing The Joker in Batman he's too over the top for such a seriously acted movie. He was also made too nasty, just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility. The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start. Basically all the elements that make a Scorsese movie great weren't there; The violence was comic book (especially the number of head shots at the end), the film-making is sub-standard. Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy.


                
Over-directed (pointless virtuosic touches that add nothing to what's happening on screen with the plot or characters), over-scored (save me from the freakin' metal Irish jig and the Stones, both heard twice in this thing), over-edited (the movie is awkward: scenes flow neither internally or into each other) and over-acted by Jack Nicholson (so far beyond the point of self-parody that it ceases to be funny), this horrid, horrid film is filled with two dimensional characters (except for Madolyn, the worst psychiatrist who never lived, who lacks even a second dimension) and more profanity and violence than you can shake a stick at.Really, I've never been a Scorsese fan, but this movie owes any praise it deserves for its twisty, turny plot to whatever was left over from the original "Infernal Affairs". Yes, in case you didn't know, this movie is a remake of a far superior Hong Kong film.As with "Dreamgirls", another inexplicably over-praised 2006 release, there's just no denying the nudity of this emperor. Tedious where it should be crackling and dull when it should be suspenseful, Marty and crew have made a nasty cinematic mess that really does not deserve the all-too-predictable praise that's been heaped on it. "Instant classic", "best film of the year", etc...I'm sorry, but the technical competency of the filmmakers is questionable and the emotional impact of the story is zip. By the last few minutes, as blowing a person's brains on the wall is becoming more of a cliché than you would ever think possible, I found myself hoping that some deus ex machina would descend from the sky and just kill everyone so it would just be f**king over already.


                
Martin Scorsese plays the role of George Steinbrener, putting out a new movie and sparing no expense in the hopes that the sheer line-up of names will keep us glued to our seats. Nicholson, Damon, DiCaprio, Sheen, Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin for heavens sake. All together amount to nothing more than a silly farce. Ridiculous dialogue and senseless violence which was poorly placed and showed. No character had any depth to speak of and poor Jack Nicholson as Mob boss? I don't think so. Jack was and always will be a solo act. His tirades are embarrassing to watch as they are forced and unnatural. What's the matter? Was DeNiro unavailable? Or maybe he just read the script and said - Pass.. The end is expected and senseless. Everybody dies, good bad, whatever. It makes so much sense how everybody in the movie communicates with cell phones and text messages. You want to tell me that the police cant figure that out? Has technology regressed so much that mob boss cell phones are not tapped? I'm sure that the good folks at Sprint would help if asked nicely. The funny part is that in one scene, the police is very proud of the cellphone surveillance they have, as Matt Damon's Cajones shrivel up. He talks to his mob friend once a day, from the office no less, texts him freely. What the hell is this? Where is the sophistication? Where is the Drama? Matt Damons fiancée sleeps with Dicaprio but nothing is made of it? How stupid. Who scripted this thing? Mark Wahlberg should have that guy shot because it made him look like an idiot more than anyone else in the movie. So, why a score of 2 instead of 1 you ask? Vera Farmiga. I can sit around for hours just watching her.
This film has received an Oscar? Why? It is not even a very good film, certainly not a Classic like "Goodfellas". The script is poor. The Direction is stale. The Characters are one-dimensional and Jack Nickolson acts badly for the first time in a decade?Is this award for the Directors past work? Scorsese has made some wonderful films and a couple of classics as well, but why did he not receive the awards due to him at the time. This proves the Oscars are still trapped in a stained reputation of it's own creation.The film is a poor re-make for Gods sake!!


                
It's no great disgrace that Scorsesse takes this studio project for the dough; but why does every critic in the country have to pretend this warmed over T.V. cop show stuff is any good. It's not. It's a completely ridiculous and unbelievable story that throws around a few Shakespearian names in a lame attempt to give itself class. If your idea of great cinema is "Face/Off" you might like it, otherwise your headed for disappointment. Nicholson does a credible job with this nonsense; nobody is bad really; though the female shrink is pretty sexist eye candy in this "tough guy" swamp. What else can I say? It would be nice if Scoresse could find something to really apply his gifts too; some of his underrated films (Casino, The Last Temptation Of Christ) deserve a second look rather than wasting time with this one.


                
****SPOILER*****To any and all that take this film seriously, you are not in on the joke. At its best, The Departed is top of the line farce. At its worst, the film is a train wreck wherein all actors of quality intentionally subvert the director and the film with farcical performances that, though a delight to watch, must have been inspired by the sheer boredom of working with a lead actor embarrassingly limited in ability, DiCaprio, and a director too far gone to realize that his film was only his at its worst moments. This is not to say that this film is dreadful to watch. The performances of Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin, were spectacular, but, then again, they almost always are. It is no trick of Scorsese that such professionals as listed made the most of savagely poor dialog. The fire they project is a necessary distraction from lines that simply don't hold up and pacing that makes little sense. Take for instance Sheen's character being thrown from the building. First, there is no reason within the logic of the film's world for his character to stay behind. He knows these people will kill him, and, obviously, if there is enough time for Leo to get away, why couldn't he follow. Second, he makes no attempt to hide in a room filled with clutter. Third, after he is killed, his character is thrown from a building in broad daylight. Let us not forget that he is a known police officer and that to be thrown from the building his murders must be inside it. So the question arises, why throw him from the building? Certainly not to speed the killers' escape, nor to ensure it. Certainly not to send a message, death in this film is the only message and how you get there is of little importance. The only logical reason is to confront Leo's character with the man's murder. This is the hand of the director and a clumsy hand it is. Such insultingly obvious moves make up the bulk of this film. If we take them as farcical, then there is a certain meta-humor to them. If they are not, and I believe this to be the case, then it is simply poor film making, and this, despite the best attempts of good actors, is a poor film. Don't believe me, take a look at the scenes between Leo and the artless Vera Farmiga, which are some of the most forced, unconvincing "love" scenes I have ever seen. True these are the two most amateurish actors in the cast, but then again with such actors we see the director at play, as he must craft every scene for them. In this case, his crafting equates to little more than depicting animal arousal, which, with Leo in the scene, is not convincing to say the least. Not convincing is, I believe the mantra of this movie, just as the cleverly placed allusion to Leo's two accents is not a convincing mask for the fact that he could not maintain a convincing southie accent for even the most highly edited of scenes. Equally unconvincing is Leo's placing of the girlhood picture of Farmiga on her wall as supposedly indicative of his utter understanding of her. It is again nothing more than the heavy handedness of a director whose loss of subtlety is equal to his rise in obsession for an actor who cannot act. That said, enjoy this film for the thoughtless, mindless fun of watching its many good actors have a good time. Do not enjoy it as a pinnacle of film making or for Leo and Farmiga. If it wins an Oscar, then you will know exactly what those awards are worth.
Granted, it’s pretty well shot. Although… in between two brilliant pieces of cinema, you have many talking heads with reverse angle shots. Not easy to do away with that when you tell a story for the cinema. Granted, it’s pretty well acted, especially by Leonardo Di Caprio. But what does this movie say about life? What is the point? Also who is the protagonist? Whom are we supposed to identify with? Logically, it should be Billy (Leonardo Di Caprio) who is the honest cop undercover in the mob. But since we often follow Colin whose character has been given Matt Damon’s pretty mug, it’s not that clear. The double romance is not milked at all. It’s just shown in parallel. And on top of that too many characters play a double game. Even the bad guy (Jack Nicholson) is an informer for the FBI. One of the thugs doesn’t turn Billy in although he has understood who he is. If “The departed” is 43 on the IMDb top list, before “City lights” , “Groundhog day” and “Mr Smith goes to Washington” we are in big trouble. Sad, sad, sad.
This movie had so much potential, so much star power; the directing, the casting: everything. But I hated it. Why? It was so incredibly dirty. Every other word is f**k this or c**t that. Jack Nicholson's character owns pornographic theaters, the sex is over the top, and the blood is a little excessive. I have a hard time believing this story because everything is just so over the top. There's just no way that any real people can be just so twisted as this--and here it is, on my TV! Mostly the language bothered me. I think I could have gotten over the rest of the shortcomings if it wasn't for the language. I just felt so dirty for having witnessed such a film--I actually shut it off. And for those of you who think I just can't handle it: I'm a 21-year-old guy who loves action movies.
I finally caught up with this only recently, and had to keep pulling my jaw up from the floor. What a deliriously bad, hysterically loopy film this is. It's as if Scorcese had dozed off in front of "Goodfellas" one night after eating a cheese and garlic pizza, and thinking, "How can I top this<U+0085>.top this<U+0085>.top this<U+0085>" And this film is the result. Not so much a film, but a dream of a film, one that defies any sort of logic. There's a rat in the gang. Could it be the ex-cop who's always on his phone? Nope, because <U+0096>after all <U+0096> they asked him, and he said it wasn't. Well, fair enough. Meanwhile, there's a rat in the police force. Could it be the cop who grew up under the wing of the mobster under investigation, the one who leaps onto his phone in full view of everyone as soon as an operation against said mobster is announced? Naaaah. Meanwhile we also have a police psychiatrist who, as luck would have it, is gorgeous and who, as her sense of professionalism would have it, thinks it's okay to sleep with not just one but two of her clients.A definition of a bad film, (which I read on a website dedicated to bad films) states that you know you're watching a bad film when the plot will only progress if the characters act stupidly.This, ladies and gentlemen, is one of those films.To be fair, Damon and Cipriano are surprisingly good, the latter, in particular, having developed a leaner, meaner look than he's known for. Unfortunately, these are balanced out by average, TV-movie performances by Sheen and Baldwin, a bogglingly bad one by Wahlberg (a piece of wood rolled on to bark rude comments) a stunningly confused one by Ray Winstone (what is that accent again?) and then<U+0085>there's Jack. Any hopes that this might be one those roles that allow him to recall his acting skills are swiftly ditched by the scenery-chomping on display here, as if Nicholson were bored and decided he could only get through it by making it as surreal as possible, meanwhile coming across as neither Irish nor Bostonian. He's no longer an actor, he is a performer, a grandstander, and this is what you get. If you don't want characterisation or subtle emotions, you call Jack. You also, in his wake, get the wildly uneven tone, veering into off-the-wall black humour (the hand at the breakfast table <U+0096> what was with THAT?) and moments so throwaway it looked for all the world as if they were being made up on the spot (Nicholson appearing, covered in blood). The end piles on twist upon twist and body upon body which, on the surface, are entertaining enough, but just don't hold up to any sort of scrutiny (and the psychiatrist does what with the tapes?) A passable no-brainer action film, and an entertaining exercise in loopy film-making from a director who should know better, praised by fans and critics who should also know better.
This film was so weak in so many areas it is difficult to even begin. Instead of wasting too much more of my time on this film I will only comment that there was no story arc to be identified at all in the film. None of the characters you meet in the first half hour are alive at the end of the film. Some of the characters you meet along the way have sub-plots that don't tie in and are not resolved in any way.This is all underscored by the low point in modern cinema featuring Jack Nicholson pretending to masturbate in a porn theater only to reveal that he is waving a dildo instead.The AMPAS should be ashamed, and all members should be replaced after this recent display.
Overall, the Departed can be summed up in 2 words. "Taxi Driver." Meaning just like Taxi Driver, The Departed has incredible acting, a powerful story, that had a tonne of potential. But all of it came crashing down when Martin Scorsese directed, almost totally killing the movie. Rendering it boring, lame and impotent.The movie is about an undercover police officer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who infiltrates a crime boss (Jack Nicholson) who is also looking for a corrupt cop (Matt Damon) who works for the crime boss (Nicholson). And the same corrupt cop (Damon) is looking for the undercover cop (DiCaprio).A simple case of hunter vs. hunter with ironically a powerful, yet impotent ending.When it comes to acting, specifically with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg, and others, they probably would all be competing with each other for the Academy awards for best actor or best supporting actors.If the Departed were directed by anyone else, Quentin Tarantino, Bryan Singer, Michael Mann, Curtis Hanson, then the Departed most likely have limited competition for both best directing and best picture at the Academy Awards.But with Martin Scorsese at the helm, successfully diverting our attention away from the excellent acting and incredible story, he guaranteed himself a well deserved Razzie award for worst director and allowed a worst screenplay Razzie award as well.The brutality and the violence of the movie was very impotent and boring. Though having noticeable amounts of humour, thanks to the excellent acting and stories, they were almost totally overshadowed by the dullness of the movies poor pace, thanks to Scorsese.From the background, one person said that the the movie was confusing. And another said that it became more stressful, but felt like it was going nowheres.But if you can only focus on the story and the acting, the Departed is recommended. Actually, either just read the book or listen to the audio book with the actors doing the voices. But if you have to see the movie as a whole, watch something else, cause the Departed is a waste of time.Future note to Hollywood, let Scorsese set everything up, and leave him out of it after that.For story and acting alone, the Departed is definitely worth a 9/10.But with Martin Scorsese successfully putting in his infamous "going no wheres fast" feel to the movie, overshadowing everything else, give the departed ....... 2.5 out of 10.
Mild spoilers here only. Read anyway and save yourself a wasted admission price.Well, what can I say about this movie? How about... "it sucked", because it did. My girlfriend and I went to this movie with high hopes having immensely enjoyed the likes of Scarface, Goodfellas, Heat, etc., and having read the fantastic reviews of The Departed posted not only by critics (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes 95%!) but also by users here. What a let down. There was a star-studded cast, and there were some moments of good acting, but on the whole, the plot line and pace were boring. Beyond the interesting idea of having a mob informant and police informant working at counter-purposes, nothing much of interest was done with this. The movie drags along until about the 2.5 hour point, when suddenly the producers must have said "hmmm... time to end this... what shall we do? I know... lets just shoot everybody in the head and be done with it!" And don't even start me on the totally unrealistic and totally contrived love triangle, which, by the way, was completely incidental and unnecessary to the plot. This show was lame. I'm sorry.
This movie suffers from the unfortunate Tarantino Syndrome that we have to live with among Hollywood movies nowadays. If you like to see brains blown out, this is your movie. You will probably forget that the plot makes no sense and that the directing does nothing but make it confusing. Yeah, of course you get to see many famous actors in one movie. I guess that's the only positive I can say about the film. Maybe it's not a positive thing considering the mess.After seeing the movie I thought maybe the movie was suffering from difficulties of being based on a book, but now I have read that it is really based on another movie. Hong Kong movie? Makes me curious if it could have been as bad as this. I won't take the risk though.


                
What a boring piece of ...This is the movie Scorcese shouldn't have made. He is just ranting around, doing what he has already done thousands of times before, but this time without and style or talent.You might like this one if you're not familiar with his previous work, or if you hadn't watched Infernal Affairs before... but if you did, i'm afraid you cannot find anything to save this unnecessary remake.The worst thing is that Scorcese completely misses the point of the original movie. It even looks like he didn't understand it. Important parts are strangely removed while unnecessary long, boring and ridiculous scenes are added. And the scenes you can find in the original are just soullessly duplicated here.None of the actors are on par with their HK counterparts, but it may not be only their fault. Where IA displays subtle characters, The Departed has only gross caricatures to offer...I think the only good thing in this movie is that people unaccustomed to HK cinema may want to know what the original looks like, and thus discover great actors, especially Leung Chiuwai and Wong Chausang, and a brisk, neat and efficient movie.One last thing : Nicholson is definitely a buffoon


                
Scorsese used to walk amongst giants. Now he mixes with midgets.Everybody to their own but I found this film to be badly acted, confusingly scripted and cliché ridden.Ex cop joins mob - mob knows there is a rat in their midst - who could it possibly be? Mobster joins cops to be a spy and within minutes of graduating climbs into the back of the mob's car which is parked yards away in full sight of the entire Boston PD! Please!!!!!! Was the story stolen from a Bugs Bunny cartoon? Jack Nicholson's performance certainly was! It was that unbelievable! The whole thing is an insult to the intelligence. As is the belief that DiCaprio or Damon can act!
Did anyone else notice that there was no plot after 45 minutes in to the movie? The whole laptop scam was the only idea that geared any sort of central plot. The rest of the movie was dedicated to finding the rat which the audience already knew. So, what, the idea of a nice ending was everybody dying? Really original. It may not have been a 2 but I was so angry about the inflated rating that I wanted to make it realistic. The acting was decent but not as good as the actors should have been. Interestingly, Wahlberg has the only dynamic character which is very odd. Damon and Dicaprio have mirror character and both are strong just not very original.
I don't see what all the fuss is about. 'The Departed' comes nowhere near the brilliance of 'Mou gaan dou' (aka 'Infernal Affairs'). Not that it's a bad film. It's quite an entertainer but it's far from great and miles from Scorsese's excellent works such as 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' (only to name a few). In my opinion, it's one of Scorsese's weakest films. 'The Departed' is a thriller and yes, it does have its twists and turns but it lacked depth and there are several unanswered questions. It could have worked well as a character study but many of the characters appeared to lack development. Also the pace of the film is a little slow at the beginning and it could have easily done without a few sequences.Here are some examples of what I disapproved.I find it hard to believe that Costigan 'masters' being a gangster in four months and Costello easily believes him and almost immediately takes him into the gang. Who is Costello? Once he's portrayed as a kingpin and then we seem him hanging out with small-time gangsters. It's also strange that no one in the force suspected Sullivan AND his superiors so easily trusted him (when everyone should be a suspect).I found the excessive swearing to be irritating. This isn't a surprise since it's a Scorsese film but somehow here it seemed forced. Sure people do swear but they could have toned it down a little. I mean if this was an attempt to make the film look more realistic then they should have improved a whole lot of other things too.The love triangle between the psychiatrist Madolyn and the two moles was very weakly portrayed. There was no development at all. What are Madolyn's motives for staying with Sullivan? She only leaves him in the end after discovering his identity. What was her relationship with Costigan? Why did Costigan send the CD to Sullivan and not to the authorities? It's understandable that he wanted to make the arrest himself but he could have sent a copy to the authorities without taking the risk. The climax, though a surprise, seemed a little rushed.The film is mainly about Sullivan versus Costigan but I think Scorsese could have made these two characters stronger by focussing a little more on their psyche.As for the performances, most of the actors do reasonably well with their parts. I liked Damon as Sullivan. It may arguably be a one-dimensional role but he played it well. It was great to see him yet again in another different role. Dicaprio too does well as Costigan but he tends to come across as a little too whiny at times. Nicholson is a pain to watch as he hams it up. The actor isn't that different from his other films and he fails miserably because this is a character that required him to act with a different style than he does with his usual persona. He fails to engage. Though Martin Sheen isn't bad, an actor of his caliber deserves far better. Wahlberg is back in swearing mode...again. Vera Farmiga shines. Alec Baldwin is irritating.Now what's good? Well, for those who haven't seen the original version, it has its twists and turns and the viewerwants to know what happens next and what the fate of Sullivan and Costigan are. The background score isn't bad either. 'The Departed' more an average thriller but still comes as a disappointment because one doesn't expect anything short of great from Scorsese.
I thought the story line was very hard to follow, and the characters had no depth to them. I kept wondering how they became involved in the story. The movie ended suddenly, and I felt very unsatisfied at the ending, and would have liked to have more questions answered at the end. The movie had an all star cast, but I felt the studio could have saved their money by using lessor known actors, and they would have received the same results. I had trouble making a connection between the Title of the movie and the story. I kept waiting for a surprise that never came. The movie was poorly made, and I was very disappointed,and I would not recommend it.


                
The Departed is the film which sets a benchmark for depravity in a production by a major motion picture studio in that it amounts to little more than star-studded snuff porn. It features filthy dialogue, completely implausible when spoken by disciplined law enforcement officers in an open forum. It includes murder by gunfire ad nauseam, not unlike viewing the Zapruder film of the assassination of President Kennedy a dozen times in swift succession. The script is mechanical, the plot turns are shocking but certainly not surprising. The development of the characters is poor, just the usual suspects.On the lighter side, the demise of Det. Queenan (Martin Sheen) provides comic relief, falling to his death in the manner made famous by Wile E. Coyote in numerous animated short subjects, all that's missing is the whistling sound effect. Regrettably Queenan is not indestructible and is not resurrected in the next scene.What remains to me the greatest shock of all is that this feature release won several awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year! It must have indeed been a vast wasteland in Hollywood in 2006 for this can of raw sewage to be so voted. I must look in the almanac and see if Private School (For Girls) won Best Picture in 1983, as it certainly was a more deserving production.Folks, life is short. Don't waste on hour of it on The Departed. And don't reward those who profit from it with so much as a nickle. If you feel you must view this, watch it on a friend's cable TV, as I unwittingly did.jHh
If the academy was in doubt with Scorsese, now i'm afraid it's him who is in doubt with them. Come on you serious about this movie??. 72 on IMDb??? This really needed to be so complicated??, did the endless ending needed to be that bloody??, do we really need so many main characters to make a good film??, more than two hours long??, Can someone believe this??, why that scene in the graveyard copying the third man??, and the most important thing: what was this film about??, did you feel something??, can't you remember a memorable, touching, funny or innovative scene?? From now on i hate cell phones.PD. I loved goodfellas, casino, raging bull, taxi driver, but that wouldn't stop me.


                
Sorry to disagree with those who liked the movie, but I have to say that I found it totally unmemorable. This work is definitely not of Oscar quality. I have seen many other Scorsese movies, and frankly, his later work (Gangs of New York, The Aviator) is just terrible. In the Departed the story line is not well presented, there are severe problems with continuity, many dialogs are poorly executed, and I could go on and on. In my opinion, these defects reflect a severe deterioration of Scorsese's craft. I hope he can recover his touch and go back to the excellent craft that he exhibited in his early days. This year there were several movies by far better than the Departed. One has to wonder why the academy gave an Oscar for a work of such a low quality.
