 Instant classic, but not for all audiences.

 Tarantino's Blue Period is OVER!

 Style rules substance

 A movie of visual splendor and a mixture of styles.

 You can't have one without the other

 Violent yet beautiful vengeance

 Escapism of the highest order.

 Silly Rabbit

 Great

 Tarantino showing he can do more then just gangster films

 Chick fights are Awesome!!!

 Filled With Action,Violence And An Inspired Cast,

 This is me, at my most masichiostic

 Awful awful awful!

 "Revenge is a dish best served cold"

 A Tale of Betrayal and Revenge With Lots of Blood

 If Revenge is a Dish, Kill Bill Vol.1 is Lip-Smacking Delicious!

 Tarantino's comeback does not disappoint

 Brilliant. Storytelling. Period.

 Horrible

 Delicious and colorful tension with that sporty retro spirit.

 Brilliant. Thrilling. Comedic. Intelligent.

 The Bride Taking Her Revenge

 Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece

 Tarantino's kung fu chick flick
