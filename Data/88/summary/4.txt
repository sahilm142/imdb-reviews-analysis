 I feel left out of the 2001 love-fest.

 You could argue that this film was an accomplishment of special effects in 1968. So What?

 A Snail Odyssey

 Amazing visuals with little substance

 Changed cinema from a direction point of view.

 Boring...

 The movie equivalent of an empty canvas

 2001 - A Space Oddity

 Slow, frustrating film that leads to...what exactly?

 Rather watch ceiling for 2 hrs

 A landmark train wreck of a film

 Only the most pretentious art house junkies need apply

 Okay?

 Suffers from the same problems of all films of this era

 Throw me a frickin' bone

 Really disappointing

 Tedious

 What is the point?

 Tedious in the extreme

 zzzzzzzzzz

 The single most boring film of all time!

 Yawn

 The most overrated science fiction of all time

 2001: A suck odyssey

 huh?
