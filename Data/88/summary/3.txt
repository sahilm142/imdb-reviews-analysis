 What??????????

 Endless, inscrutable, and outdated

 Criminally overrated

 2001: A Solar Bore

 2001: A Space What?

 Not sure a younger audience can appreciate this film

 Excruciating, almost physically painful

 Might be great, but wasn't for me.

 I don't get it

 I sat through it as a child but.............

 Smart, but way too slow

 It's like space looks great but is most blank space.

 Overrated

 It LOOKS good...

 It's crap

 What the heck was this?

 Monkey madness, space ballet and an out of psychotic computer

 Way overrated

 Who are these people?... Everyone here is dumber . . .

 2001: A Space Bordity

 Great art dates badly

 It was a movie that had too much, but not enough.

 good for film students but bad for almost every one else.

 The Horror that is 2001

 the lamest movie ever produced, bar none
