 The movie is an insult to the book.

 Why make movies based on something you don't like?

 What is Jackson smokin?

 Am I the only person who hated this film?

 Tokien's spirit has been exorcised from his story like Saruman from Theodin in the film.

 Disappointed and Angry

 Why, Peter. Why?

 Boring

 Take out 5 chapters, put some made up rubbish in and you have Peter Jackson's The Two Towers

 Even worse than the first film

 Pretty, but boring!

 terrible disappointment

 FOTR was a disaster, TT an obscenity

 Here's why this movie fails...

 A horrible atempt at entertainment.

 Those of you who voted 10 have no clue

 An Abomination

 A decent film, but nothing great.

 Needless ommissions and inclusions spoil an otherwise highly entertaining film (contains spoilers)

 Ok but nothing special

 "Like butter stretched over too much bread"

 a visual achievement, a screen-writing debacle

 Middle Class Rubbish

 What the hell?

 The Lord of the Rings: The Boring Snorefest
