There are some movies where you already know it's not gonna be good, this one have some proofs of it : the movie is 2h40 long and the story is just focused on a couple. I'm not married so i didn't feel to be concerned in this story.I think you want to know why i watched this movie. Only because i like the director, Ingmar Bergman, i loved his movie "Wild Strawberries" and i also liked "Fanny and Alexander" and "The Virgin Spring". I heard a lot about this one so why not.About this film we are going to follow the normal life of a couple with children there are often tensions and many questions in couples in general like : "Does she/he really loves me? Can i trust her/him?. The thing i blame about this film is it's duration about an uninteresting subject : 2h40 about a couple squabbling is very long. It's not very supportable when you see your own parents squabbling few minutes, so imagine suffer this during a large part of a movie.I think this film would be good for a married couple, or not married though, because it really shows the reality in couples.
