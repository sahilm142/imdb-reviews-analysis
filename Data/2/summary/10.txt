 For Me, This Is The Definitive Film

 "The Godfather" is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made

 Another kind of "family movie"

 An Iconic Film

 Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised

 This Movie Has Haunted My Life...

 A Masterpiece

 perfect

 An Epic, Masterful Look into the Underground World

 The world inside the underworld!

 An exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances...

 The Godfather

 For me it isn't "the greatest ever", but it's still great

 The Pioneer of All Filmmaking

 A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus

 Sets the standard for the gangster art film.

 Best film ever made

 Mind blowing drama, a must see

 #2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!

 This Movie is an Offer you Can't Refuse

 The Godfather make me an offer that I cannot refuse. This movie is a masterpiece.

 The Greatest Cast For A Movie Ever.

 The Geatest Movie Ever Made

 "For justice, we must go to Don Corleone".

 VERY good, but not the best...
