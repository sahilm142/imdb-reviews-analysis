 A dive like I've never seen before

 Clipping my toenails is more interesting than season 2

 Season 1: excellent. Season 2: pretentious, violent, and boring.

 2nd season is unwatchable

 Season 1 was outstanding, season 2 well....

 What the hell happened in second season ?!

 An absolute chore to watch *SPOILERS*

 Season 2

 Unwatchable

 Season 2: Long, boring, confusing mess

 Season 2 is such a failure...One of the most overrated TV shows of all time

 Devolved into Gibberish

 Season 2 ah good ol' snore festival

 Watched my last episode!

 Remember when HBO made great shows?

 So dire that I struggle to understand the outstanding ratings it apparently gets from so many people.

 I'm yawning

 The Worst TV Show Ever Made...

 Season 2 ? Nah, better make it Season 1

 Pretentious, Overrated, Poorly Written

 Season 1 was great. Season 2, not so much...

 For The Brain-Dead

 Poor 2nd season

 Boring

 Went so down hill it's not even watchable
