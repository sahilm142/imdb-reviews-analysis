Just because it's a good content movie, doesn't mean it's a good movie.. If we Indians want to decide a good movie based on contents, then we will never be as successful as hollywood.. A Good movie should have a Good script, good acting, good direction & writing, character development, originality, good music, pace, unpredictablity on certain genres & so on... TZP definetly lacks in many areas, Knowing this movie is India's official entry for oscars is embarrassing... Remember, a good content in a movie, doesn't make the movie good!
