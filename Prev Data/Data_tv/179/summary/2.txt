 Avoid unless you're not very critical about tv series in general

 Fully of bs!!

 absolutely overrated

 Do not watch this series

 DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!! Childish and utterly overrated tv show

 I feel scammed

 Not worth your time

 So many flaws and holes!

 Lots of nonsense afterwards even if it has started too good

 Do not be fooled by the rating.

 What's Spanish for "yawn"?

 Copy of "inside man" of Denzel Washintong and Clive Owen

 A telenovéla that starts off with potential

 Barely anything redeemable here

 Very overrated with a lot of nonsense

 It looks good

 ejjjj

 I just can't believe how overrated this series is...

 This is so bad. Don't watch it.

 Painfully Hard To Watch - Totally Overrated

 Uma trampa

 A disciplined course of viewing

 Pasan cosas absurdas en la serie

 Amateurish and cringy

 Good but way too long
