 Why does this get so much praise?

 Escape from Camp Deadly (3 days Screen Marathon)

 Disappointing

 I hate this movie. 'Nuff said.

 Toy Story 3 - Kidding Us

 I wouldn't recommend this dark, joyless, product-placing, fantasy/horror film

 This was not what I expected

 Classic comedy? Me can't brain.
