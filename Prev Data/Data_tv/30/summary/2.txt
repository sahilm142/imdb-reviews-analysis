 Disappointing

 Gross

 Not my cup of tea

 Dull Imitation

 As of Season 3, 'Black Mirror' has been Netflixed

 Good idea for a show. Repetitive and boring after season 2

 Impossible!

 Most Pretentious Series I have ever watched

 Vile

 a sort of British Twilight Zone

 waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
