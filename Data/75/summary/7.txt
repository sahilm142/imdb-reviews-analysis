 A valiant, but flawed effort by The Master (Possible Spoilers)

 Good but overrated.

 A great psychological thriller by Hitchcock.

 Really good but the greatest?

 Veritgo

 The second Jimmy Stewart/Hitchcock movie

 A good example of Hitchcock's psychological thrillers

 Good, but the greatness eludes me.

 Somewhat disappointing

 Hitchcock brings his patented brand of mystery to San Francisco.

 Dizzy plot

 too long, too slow, but worth watching

 Intense study of compulsions, deception and lust

 Fine, but over-hyped

 Heightened tension

 A Fine Psychological Thriller!

 A typical Hitchcock movie

 psychological thriller, excellent performances

 weak characters (spoilers ahead)

 Great plot, as always from Hitchcock's works

 A Defining Work in the Career of Alfred Hitchcock.

 Blond Obsession

 Showing its age?

 A One time watch and that's all.

 More boring in comparison with other Hitchcock classicals
