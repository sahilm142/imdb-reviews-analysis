 "The Thing" is John Carpenter's masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!

 A classic that still holds up to this very day

 Finally getting recognition.

 Flips the scenario round from the original to great effect.

 Intelligent Splatter

 I worship this film. 10/10

 Right up there with "Halloween"--one of Carpenter's best!

 Why The Thing?

 Still my all time favorite sci-fi/horror!!!

 The last John Carpenter classic

 AMAZING!

 One of the best horror movies ever, finally getting recognition.

 The ultimate in alien terror.

 There's no other movie like this one

 You couldn't ask for better sci-fi horror!

 the most professionally astute horror film of the 80's, very entertaining

 This "Thing" DELIVERS!

 "Maybe we at war with Norway?"

 "Man is still the warmest place to hide."

 Easily Carpenter's best

 This is how a movie is made

 One of the greatest American films of the post 60s

 An equal to Alien

 The Ultimate in Sci-Fi Horror!!!

 "Clear!" I've loved this great classic for just about forever, it's just so endlessly gripping and so much fun.
