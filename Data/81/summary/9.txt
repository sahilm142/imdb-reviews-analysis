 The Movie That Made Me Appreciate Mozart

 Competently directed, extremely well-acted, exquisitely mounted...

 To give everything you have to music and come up short

 A well-done and memorable piece of work

 Landmark historical speculation

 Stanzi shines in the Director's Cut!

 Rock me Amadeus! Amadeus is a beautiful musical masterpiece

 Watch and learn

 Excellent in the director's cut, though still long.

 "God was singing through this little man to all the world, unstoppable, making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar."

 I hate costume dramas, but not this one.

 Flawed, but who cares?

 If you aren't interested in classical music, you soon will be

 A very unusual biographical film; disturbing and at the same time deep

 Simply captivating

 Brilliance born out of stupidity

 Dat Laugh Tho

 An Interesting Take on the Amadeus Story

 The Mercurial Genius

 Amadeus as entertainment

 250th Anniversary Tribute, More Than Deserved
