 One of the best again from Hayao Miyazaki...

 Early masterpiece from Miyazaki

 Great movie; Paquin comes up lame

 Not my favorite Miyazaki

 An Adventure For All Ages

 "The way you fell from the sky, I thought you were an angel."

 Not Miyazaki's best, but it still contains his trademark magic'

 A bizarre storyline with surreal characters and beautiful animation

 A classic not to be missed!

 Entertaining fantasy film

 Top class Miyazaki

 Howl meets Atlantis

 Castle in the sky has Miyazaki's signature all over it!

 Enjoyable fairtytale with some great graphics...

 Overrated anime fare

 There are plenty of things that don't make sense but well, good, creative stuffs usually don't make sense!

 Didn't love it as much as other Miyazaki films, but that might not be the movie

 LAPUTA - CASTLE IN THE SKY (Hayao Miyazaki, 1986) ***
