Umm I don't know. It just is not that funny...ummmm.... In fact, I didn't laugh not even once throughout whole season. I really have no idea how people can watch rubbish. Yes it is a total rubbish. not funny not even a bit. To tell you truth I forced myself to watch this series because my girlfriend insisted me to watch. Well her taste is quite weird. What? I have to write 10 lines? It's more than this show deserves actually. OK I will try bla.. blaa.. baa. braa.. baraaa.. lab.. laabla... bla. Is that okay? I guess it is. So if you are dying to laugh, had better avoid this show for sure. And if you are a basement nerd who watches almost anything, go for it.


                
This 2004 Channel 4 comedy series is a parody that presents itself as a badly-made, previously unscreened, 1980s horror series that's interspersed with the creator talking about it as though it's a masterpiece. It's just one bad joke over and over again - someone thinks that an awful series that he made two decades earlier is brilliant, but it's actually terrible. Neither the fake series - nor the creator talking about it - are funny in the slightest.
