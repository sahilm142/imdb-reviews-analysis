 Soulless TV

 Just read this review, THEN watch the show.

 Why, oh why.

 Above average, at best, and very over-hyped.

 The Problem with 'Cinematic Television'

 Horrible show full of horrible people

 overrated

 All hype, no payoff

 One huge flaw in this show

 Trash parading as moral ambiguity
