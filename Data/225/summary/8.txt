 Impressive.

 Oh Captain! My Captain!

 Oh Captain, My Captain. It Is One Of Robin Williams Best

 Inspiring in multiple ways and very character driven.

 Great Robin Williams Film

 A film every parent should see!

 Inspirational

 Leaves of Class

 Robin Williams tells students to "seize the day"

 A well done film about coming of age

 Brilliant Piece

 Sad, though quite inspirational

 Amazing movie!!

 "How to seize the day"

 Teaches a lot

 Still holds up today as a loveable and life-affirming tale

 Great coming of age story

 You must live before you die. You must be an individual above that will bring you down.

 "Now in my class, you will learn to think for yourselves again."

 Drama with a poetic flavor attached to the imagination

 Enlightenment encounters discipline and tradition.

 Great Movie

 Seize your day and watch this movie

 a great movie at the height of Robin Williams

 O Captain! My captain!
