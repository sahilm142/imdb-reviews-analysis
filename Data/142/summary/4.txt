 The story of a genius dumbed down for us yokels.

 Pathetic

 Ignoble portrait of a Nobel laureate

 Ron Howard Movies Are Sooooooo Uninteresting

 Overrated bunch of hooey!

 Happier Days Indeed

 Another Hollywood Tearjerker

 Poorly conceived female character...

 Will appeal to the mindless U.S. Oscar-grabbing pap, but it's really not that good!

 The most overrated film in recent memory

 An overrated movie, please don't waste your time with it

 Number crunching

 Well acted, but poor story telling

 Beautiful mind, not beautiful movie

 Decent, but most definitely not Best Picture material

 boring dull

 Ron Howard tripe

 Russell Crowe,Russell Crowe and Russell Crowe

 Honest

 Little thought went into this film

 Just no fizz to it.

 A glimpse into a man's mind is not as electrifying as people think...

 A Beauty Undermined

 Kitsch! (or alt. title: "The Man Who Was Afraid Of Hats")

 Hollywood distortion
