 It's good, but nowhere near as good as the reviews would have you believe

 Good but not great.

 somewhat less than the sum of its parts

 Fascinating, but politically crude

 powerful story about the Spanish civil war - fantasy aspect the weaker side

 Beautiful Decay

 An overly fusion of Shindler's List and Cinderella

 The Worst Two Hours Of My Life.

 Very beautiful but the violence didn't help the movie in any way.

 A film that stands out visual as a tremendous achievement on par with The Prestige, yet lacks the plot to match up any further.

 Moving and powerful

 Unfulfilled Potential.

 Some People Can't Escape Their Fate

 ambitious

 Dorothy on a Drastic Bummer.

 Good, but not what you probably think it is

 A touching fairy tale, but not for the young audience

 Definitely not your typical Peter Pan of a movie...

 Incongruous mix of fantasy and reality

 It's all been done before, but not like this!

 A violent and mysterious fairytale about resisting under oppression

 There is really no escape into fantasy here, just distraction

 Brilliant Movie

 Modern day wizard of oz . Labyrinth of the Faun.
