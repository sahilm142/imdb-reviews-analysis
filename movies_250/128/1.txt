Wait. comedy? This is a war movie. Yes, it is supposed to be. It is not. What was planned as a serious, deep, psychological wartime escape drama, in reality turned into a raw, unbaked, half-cooked slapstick with awful character development, with awful performances, especially those from McQueen and Bronson, need one mention terribly laughable and horribly unserious delivery. The whole thing seems like a lame amateurish school play with absolutely irregular moves and wrong lines. I never, but never believed a single thing they said or did. The whole film just smacks of a cheap second-rate low-budget effort of a mediocre dubious merit. There is no merit, as even actors betray a playful unseriousness of what they say or do. Does the movie ever seem to be tragic or decent? Nay, even the killing spree seems to be staged or simply poor. Poor - this is the word. Every little detail in this film is poor or false.


                
It has come to my attention that the whole reason the escape happened was because of some very smart and resourceful Canadians. Yet there is no mention of Canadians in the movie. Why is that? No seriously, why were the Canadians not mentioned? If not for Canadians the Great Escape would not have happened. "Tom, Dick and Harry" were the making of some amazing Canadians and no one knows because the movie never mentioned them. I think this is appalling. Henry Birkland, Wally Floody and Tommy Thompson are heroes and great Canadians and I, among others, did not know their names until watching a documentary on the great escape. It is a shame that Canadians have been so downplayed in the role of winning the wars that have occurred in our past. I am a proud Canadian and the more I learn about the war and our role in them, the more I realize that Canadians have been largely unmentioned. We played a huge role in winning these wars and our soldiers deserve an honorable mention. To all our soldiers, I say thank you and god bless.


                
The movie is absolutely ridiculous. The most overrated piece of art of all time.Let me tell you something. Unless you are British, you are going to hate this absolute dog of a film. And the British love it, just because a super-cool guy like Steve McQueen hangs out with the British folks and also for the main theme (let's all chant!).Accurate? German WW2 POW camp? Sounds more like summer camp to me! These people are caught trying to escape and the Nazis just take them by the hand to get them back in line. And they still wear their uniforms, not some prison overalls -which is the first thing the Germans would do: take off their pride. It's a joke really! Let me be more specific: the English (and the one American) can do WHATEVER they want in this camp, while the Nazis are just waiting for someone to escape in order to get them back in prison. And what about those secret meetings! The Germans were minding their own business, while the POWs were designing plots to escape. Yeah, right!Apart from all that, the movie is boring, not going anywhere. No acts of heroism, no surprises, no script, no women.I wouldn't care for the story if at least there was some realism in this horrible movie, but a parody is all you get. If instead of McQueen it was Leslie Nielsen, we would have a great comedy.0/10 (what a joke!)


                
Over rated  action/drama WW 2 escape film that suffers from extreme HOLLYWOOD formula watering down directng style.The acting was good but the soundtrack was very condescending and the atmosphere had no grit at all.All this was done on purpose by the film makers though as they targeted  a more artistically challenged GENERAL AUDIENCE crowd.A how to for DISNEY STYLE war films.The result is a movie that had potential to be a MASTERPIECE CLASSIC but merely achieves a good rating.Also,blatant script inconsistensies can be very irritating to intelligent people, like Charles Bronson masterfully digging incredible tunnels like a super human Mole,then all of a sudden inexplicably turns into a CLAUSRTROPHOBIAC for over dramatic effect?!Please!If you want a great WW 2 escape film,check out BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI,VICTORY or STALAG 17 for that matter........


                
*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review:The Great Escape is a blatant and obvious Steve McQueen war film that doesn't punch all the punches correctly. The tedious and untimely draw-backs to McQueen visiting his detention cell just get more boring and frustrating as you watch. The never ending and pointless 'walk about' around the concentration camp scenes become tiresome and forgetful. Although 'Escape' is layered with world-renowned actors, it still is placed with an of form Steve McQueen and blabby acting.Director John Sturges tries to layer all this substance that doesn't work and by the end you feel like he's committed a common and severe crime that you wonder and ask yourselves- why put me through this"?Verdict:Despite the backup of some great actors (excluding McQueen) you can only help but beg for mercy for it to end.*Tragic
