I was very disappointed. The movie was so boring I started to check my watch while watching. Even the new StarWars movies offer more suspense then this bad second part of the Ring-trilogy. Just boring! What's boring about part 2? Simply everything! The first Ring-Movie was exciting and it made me curious about part two. But after watching part two I decided not to watch part 3!


                
There is not much to say about this sequel, as there is no plot line, no interesting characters to comment on, no interesting scenes. Only boring battle-scenes (which *are* impressively made, obviously, but .. well .. we're getting used to that compliment, aren't we?) and simplistic characterization. I must admit I wasn't too big a fan of the first part, but the second part really got me annoyed (the crucual battlescene lasts for almost a full hour). So, everybody wants the ring. Big deal. And can someone please remove that dwarf that's the only one who Jackson gave the right to be funny?What can we expect in the last part? Battlescenes of 2 hours?


                
This is about one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I suppose if you read the book, you might be able to enjoy it, referencing back to characters thoughts and emotions etc. But for those of us who didn't read the book, it was a bunch of scenes of people walking. A wide shot of people walking. A close up of people walking. and not much else happening. I'm trying to figure out why everyone in these books has two names. (As if the plot isn't complicated enough for those of us who haven't read the book.) The only redeeming thing in the whole movie is that goblin thing that calls the ring 'precious'. (even he has two names) Hence I gave it a two, instead of a one. Sure the special effects were great. But great special effects does not mean the movie is great. I liked the first LOTR movie, quite a bit more than I expected, actually. I would rate that one much higher. But as a follow up this one was a disappointment. So much so that I didn't bother to see the third one. Thats how boring I thought 'The two towers' was.


                
Though I didn't enjoy the first of the Lord of the Rings films, I was eager to see the second, because the reviews were so terrific.  I was terribly disappointed.  I'd never read the Tolkien books--maybe that would have helped, I dunno.  I do know that I found the plot hard to follow at times, and some of the dialog was hard to understand.  But what really bothered me most was how cliche-ridden the film was--characters giving each other meaningful looks out of a grade Z flick, characters whose good or evil qualities screamed out at you, music that was laughably heavy handed, etc. For me, there were only two strong points: the battle scenes gave an unusually good sense of what combat was like long ago, and the special effects were impressive, especially the computer-enhanced character of Smeagol.


                
Seeing this movie would be like walking in on any movie after it starts and leaving before it ends.  I think that when you go into a movie, you should get a complete movie experience.  The LOTR SHOULD have come out as one giant nine-hour movie with intermissions (of course I understand that it would not make any money), but at least I would have felt as though I got my money's worth.


                
***SPOILERS*** If you think Roger Moore's goofy portrayal of James Bond defines 007, then you might like this version of Tolkien's classic work.  Slapstick and goofy one-liners, etc., abound.  Until seeing this farce, I had no idea that a dwarf has no endurance, an elf can nearly get ridden down by a company of Rohirrim without hearing them coming, and Faramir is just Boromir with a bow!  Wait--cue the crescendo of the theme--Legolas is going to do a goofy ride-the-shield-down-the-stairs trick!  Hey--where's the brave dwarven warrior Gimli, representing the Dwarves--he seems to have been swapped between movies for a clown wearing a banner reading "Comic Relief"?
Why is it that all of the silliest parts of the movie are the ones that are changes from the book?  I have more respect for Tolkien than ever (and far less for Peter Jackson).  I guess Jackson figured that Tolkien fans will see it anyway and decided to Hollywoodize it to gain favor with the Lowest Common (pun intended) Denominator..and I guess it doesn't matter that it makes *him* look stupid to add such gaping holes in the plot.
Well what can I say besides can anyone find anything in the movie that relates to the book besides names?  Ok I exaggerate a little, but they just appeared to be trying to use every hollywood trick at once to improve what would have been a great movie without them and in doing so ruin it.  Since when did Celeborn die at Helm's deep?  Where in the books did Aragorn go over the cliff?  It looks as though they just used the name "Lord of the Rings" in order to generate profit on this one, not something that should ever be inflicted upon purists.  Sorry to those who enjoyed it, but it should never have been released under the title it bears.


                
I truly wasn't impressed with the first one. This one was a little better. I stress - A little! Absolutely ridiculous story line with unbelievable characters. The main characters were by far eligible for the Razzie awards (For worst actors). The best part of this movie was the end battle and the New Zealand scenery. Thats it. Terrible dialogue and even worse premise to boot. Actually I must add that the virtual character Gollum/Sméagol was the best character in the entire movie. his schizophrenic personality always made you wonder if he would 'lose it' or not! He was amusing and actually should win the Grammy for best actor. Cause the others were so thin, weak and unimportant.what a terribly sad waste of time that 2.6 hours was. YAWN!


                
The greatest CGI special effects (only in terms of CGI) film so far.The acting was superb and the movie was done with a lot of love put into it.BUT.....just like the first Lord Of The Rings,the characters were not well portrayed.If if the first Lord Of The Rings film we only had one great character in Wizard Gandarf The Gray, in this second installment,we have only have two great characters,namely Wizard Gandarf The White and (the all CGI character) Gollem.Fantastic CGI effects for Gollem!Puts Jar Jar Binks (of Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones) to shame.The story was also nothing spectacular.The fantastic battle/action sequences had to make up for the transitional storyline which was not grand at all.Color was not good.They should have made the cinematography more colorful to compliment the fantastic CGI effects.Granted the film was supposed to have a dark edge/mood,but the storyline and settings alone could provide that mood without making everything look almost black and white.All in all,this film is a Classic but not a Masterpiece and even falls short of being better than the first Lord Of The Rings due to that film having a better storyline.I realy expected the story to be better this time but it fell short in that category.But the CGI met my full expectations.INCREDIBLE BATTLE SEQUENCES!Still one of the best films all time (Classic) and I would easily place it in the Top 10 Sword And Sorcery Films All Time (as of this writing).Only for fans of Sword and Sorcery films,big CGI special effects movies and big fans of the lead actors.......


                
In the humorous spirit of the notorious two word review of Spinal Tap's album entitled "Shark Sandwich", I would also have to classify The Two Towers as a "Sh#%t Sandwich".While the 1st installment had a magical chemistry of good vs. evil, the Two Towers is stale and uninspired in comparison. A majority of the characters that were once so interesting, are now flat and boring. Left standing are Gollum and Gríma - two characters who made a very memorable impression on me.Technically, the effects were not executed as well either - I saw plenty of bad blue screen shots, and the miniatures lacked scale and presence. Gollum on the other hand was amazing!! They really spent some quality time making this character come to life, interact, and blend in with the environments.To summarize my experience with The Two Towers - a good opening, boring middle and by the end I just didn't care.


                
*****************************SPOILERS*************************************** ******** Who the heck does Peter Jackson think he is?  Tolkien?  Delete from the story for editing purposes, add a little to make it more approachable. BUT DO NOT CHANGE THE WHOLE STORY!!I couldn't even bring myself to appreciate it for a piece of cinematic art, as I was totally appalled at the changes to the storyline.  Too many to mention, but to highlight: Faramir kidnapping Frodo to Osgiliath? Aragorn falling off a cliff and falling in a river? Making a big deal about some imaginary exodus of the Rohirrim??? Elves from Lothlorien, and no ents/huorns to save Helm's Deep?
The long, drawn out changes to the story totally ruined the movie.  I agree with some of the other postings that I have seen, that say it was these changes that made the movie overlength.  And the copy I saw either have been spliced, or there was some really awful edits.What a departure from FotR!!  I took my family and friends five times, bought both DVD's, movie books, etc.  Well no more, not for this trash!Jackson, you have one year to correct your mistakes.  I'll go see Return of the King, just to find out.  But you will never get one dime from me ever again, if you do as poor a job with that.  You were capable, and should have done, a better job.
This is the middle movie about Middle Earth, whatever that is supposed to be. Is there an Upper and Lower Earth, a Right and Left Earth, or what?Anyway, as I watch the hobbits still on their mission to get the ring somewhere to do something with it, I cannot help but wonder why someone doesn't just make another ring, if they want one so badly. I mean, what one person did once, surely another person could do again. I'm sure there is some perfectly good, unbelievable reason why other evil rings cannot be made, but I am frankly past caring, because it has been six hours now, and I am really tired of it all.Especially wearying is the relentless epic-speak employed by almost everyone in the movie, which has made me sick of hearing the preposition "of." These people could never say something like, "We need to go through the Lincoln Tunnel" or "We'll have to cross the Golden Gate Bridge." They would have to say, "We must pass through the Tunnel of Lincoln" or "We must cross over the Bridge of the Gate of Gold." And even when they say something that might look like normal dialogue when written on paper, the characters utter all their lines gravely and ponderously, as if everything they say is of the deepest significance.An exception to this is Sam, Frodo's companion. He actually talks normally. As a result, he became my favorite character, the one I most wanted to hear from. And when he made his speech about the goodness of the world being worth fighting for, it had more effect on me than anything else said in the movie, because it was spoken naturally. Furthermore, Sam's face is easier to take than Frodo's look of angelic innocence. I wish Sam had the ring, and one of the other hobbits were his sidekick, leaving Frodo out of the story altogether.
When I came out from the movies after seeing this one, I was upset and annoyed like mad. I don't think any movie could've achieved that. This was supposed to be an adaptation of the story we used to read when kids. It was supposed to be beautiful and makes us happy. On the first movie they just skipped some really important parts and focused the plot on some random stuff they invented. On this movie, they confirmed they had no intentions on coming back to the regular plot... they stole our story and modified it for the masses. This one is specially bad because it just starts ignoring the important aspects of the story and starts cutting content for no reason. The movie is also extremely short and when it finishes you're wondering, well, what did just happen, did they really end it here? Did they really miss all that? Where are the happy parts where I can rest and smile for a while? All the 3 movies have this issue, everything's wrong all the time... this movie is not an exception, and it shouldn't be like that. This is not Lord of The Rings. Want a good story? Go buy the books, spit at this blasphemy. If you don't know the story, this movie will probably be OK... maybe a 6, the book is a hundred stars out of ten, and they killed it. But this was supposed to be an adaptation, and it's a really bad one. The only reason it has 2 stars is because well... graphics, money. I can't argue that... You can see cool stuff like Ents, but I could've seen that on a 3 minutes video and I would not feel disgusted like I do now only by remembering this thing.


                
Not a fan. Too long... FAR too long! Too drawn out... FAR too drawn out! The scenery is lovely, the cinematography excellent, the special effects brilliant.... other than that.... far too long and drawn out! Gollum was pretty cool, the other characters bored me.... Oh, I lie, the Orks were pretty cool, and those walking trees, they were cool as well. I wish I could say more about this, in fact not just this but the whole trilogy... I wish I could, but I can't! Sorry..... Far, far too long! They knocked the nail right on the head in Clerks 2... Just a lot of people walking... Some lovely scenery, stunning views, excellent special effects and lovely scenery (did I mention that?). If you like scenery, you'll like this film!


                
The second film of the trilogy, and I went into the cinema without much expectations, mainly ensuring that I had a good night sleep the night before so I dont fall asleep like in the first one. I feel that The editors had given in to pressure and 'hollywood-ized' the movie. Making the pace faster, the action more pronounced and the plot, well, not making much sense. Let's say, helm's deep. Great sets, big army (which, I must add, looks like recycled effects from the Mummy Returns) and lotsa fighting and loud SFX that kept me awake. However, it seems that they have caved themselves in without so much preparing to fight (say, traps in the plains, what not.) There were NO flyers here, so why were there trebuchets in Gondor and not here? Sorry, none of it makes sense to me. It just seems to be a way to make the movie look 'Epic'.


                
I gave Peter Jackson the benefit of every doubt I heard prior to my first viewing of the Two Towers.  For this reason was I doubly shocked to see that it is no more than Mr. Jackson's own version of the story with nothing more than original names and settings.  There was not one aspect of the book he did not manage to alter.  This would not be such a problem, were it not for the fact that this book NEEDED NO ALTERING!!!  These movies remain the most ambitious cinematic endeavor to date, but this most recent installment makes me desperately hope for an even greater one in the future.  This movie shows no respect for the actual story, changing timelines, personalities, events, and everything else that could be changed while still seeming to be based on the book.  In conclusion, the best thing I can say about this last effort is that it was thorough...thorough in its deforming the story, and thorough in disappointing this avid Tolkien reader.


                
The movie was about as interesting to watch as a dripping faucet. It doesn't do the book any justice. Perhaps the most irksome feature is the fact that the classic novel is so grossly tampered with in order to accommodate well-known Hollywood actors (particularly the character of Arwen, played by the poorly-casted Liv Tyler). If the idea is to incorporate more female characters, they did a terrible job, as the Arwen scenes basically involve overly illuminated close ups of her face contorting into various crying scenes. As for other female characters, Eowyn is decent but doesn't live up to what I imagined her to be like in the book (strong, steadfast), but at least she gets some coverage. Galadriel is wonderfully portrayed by Cate Blanchett but her role is minuscule. Anyway, enough of that. There were some good scenes, like when the hobbits meet Treebeard, and most scenes involving Frodo were decent although Gollum is way too cute to be anything like the book's version. Worm tongue is also weak (not creepy enough). So my main issues are poor character renditions and alteration of plot. Wish they'd stuck to the story more accurately instead of turning it into a cheesy soap opera.


                
Let me be the dissenting voice in the wilderness. I don't like this series of movies.The special effects are flat out amazing but the story...ug. I just can't get into it at all. I've seen and sat through the first and third chapters, but the second one (reviewed here) bored me to sleep.I always wondered why, in sci-fi movies that have magic in them, the characters don't just magically arrive at their destination. Or go by air on some creature. These long soul building adventures just are not for me.Maybe in ten years I'll be able to appreciate this series, but not now.


                
Spoilers!!!! That the makers of this movie can claim that it is based on Tolkien is amazing to me.  I'm not an official "purist", but I have read the books, and I know that the books are far better in every aspect.  But I won't even compare it to the books... even compared to the average movies coming out of Hollywood, this film is money-making trash.In its defense I would say that the movie has excellent computer animations. I was very satisfied with the way the Ents looked and moved (and stomped on orcs!), and also was impressed with the oliphants.  In particular I liked the image of Gandalf and the Balrog falling towards the Underworld ocean. (even if it is not from the book)Otherwise, the movie is a mess.  Peter Jackson obviously could not handle the diverging plot lines.  (for example, Merry and Pippin are stuck on Treebeard's shoulder while about a week of movie time goes by - quite a long hike through the forest!)  The transitions between plots are interrupting, and jumble the flow of the story.  I can't imagine trying to make sense of what everyone was doing if I had not previously read the books.The characters in the movie are completely boring, even the new ones. Now that the heroes have been introduced, it appears that the director has lost any energy to develop them further.  Gimli becomes the comic stump (and if I really want a dose of midget humor, I'll go to a frat party or watch Jackass).  Arwen's weepy narcissism goes out of control.  Way too much time is given to her and the other Elvish leaders to act as if they are speaking profoundly and weep prettily in screen closeups.  Legolas is now the stunt man, with very little character left to express.  Faramir is weak (should have followed the book, Mr. Jackson).  Eowynn will hopefully get more attention in the last movie, but she was well-done in the movie, as were Wormtongue and Eomer.  Gollum is also fairly amusing, even if he must be turned into a schizo-comic Hamlet.The fact that the movie ended on a somewhat upbeat note (victory of Helm's Deep) instead of the darker, almost hopeless note of the book (Frodo taken captive by orcs after Shelob), is a critical flaw.  Precisely what makes one so eager to read on in Tolkien is the situation of near despair, which makes the reversals of fortune, or eucatastrophe, so welcome.  Maybe it's true that the middle book is the hardest one to pull off, but that's no excuse for making a poor movie.  I had hoped that Peter Jackson could rise to the occasion.  Instead he has made a mush of weak emotions, contrived nobility, and lots of slimy orcs.I don't see how a fan of Tolkien can watch the movie and not feel at least a bit cheated, and a bit insulted.  This movie is neither beautiful nor interesting, in the artistic sense; it is flashy sensory entertainment produced for universal ease of consumption.  If you like the Tolkien-flavored yogurt, well then, enjoy.
It's a movie about walking! That's it. It really is one of the worst, most boring and tiresome films I have ever seen, and I've watched loads of films! I do not know how they managed to make the film this long with not much storyline to it. I would not recommend this, there is no point to it.I can't say much more about it as it is walking, more walking and a ring. I think how they made 3 films about the same storyline is beyond me. I think the books were just as boring, and can't believe the publicity they have got of how 'good' they are, they are not. The effects, set and acting is reasonable, but that is nothing if there is no storyline.


                
A movie about walking? What a waste of time! This movie run time is just to long for me plus im only posting this review to clear my things to do on IMDb. So i looked for a movie i really dislike to bash it. The Lord of the rings series suck!


                
Again more pointlessness and boring scenery shots of the bloody little dwarf walking throughout endless fields. JRR Tolkein has a knack for boring people to death and he pulls it off like a pro - I hope he can sleep at night! I did think it was better than the first one which is a general viewpoint although only slightly. There was a bit more action in this one and again the characters were played well with what they had to work with, although I am terrible at acting but I'm sure I could have walked for a few hours! Here's hoping that the third one will be a slobber knocker because if it isn't I'm gonna screamed that I wasted ?8 on a piece of crap - again!


                
Watching the blasphemy that this film is unfold, you can practically hear Jackson's voice in the background: "Push hobbits out of the way?  Move humans center stage?  Devote an hour of screen time on sequences that never occured in the novel or took up one or two pages?  No problem Mr. New Line Cinema big wig!Maybe if Jackson had been faithful to Tolkein's work, this film might deserve a fraction of the acclaim the people on this forum are a tad to free to bestow.


                
Let me start off by saying that 'The Two Towers' was definitely worth the Oscar for visual effects. The Golum character is a marvel of the arts and technology. All the visual effects in this movie are better than the first one (where you could even see the wires in the Gandalf-Saruman battle).Now, I believe that they should make only one LOTR, not a trilogy. Take for instance the complete 'Two Towers'. It could be easily omitted in its entirety, as it doesn't really advance the story any further and frankly I believe that the only thing it offers is the great Golum graphics.Just because there are three books, doesn't mean that there must be three movies. Everyone's treating 'Lord of the Rings' like something sacred, which is not.It's like Oscar Wilde said- "Anyone can write a three volume novel. All it takes is complete ignorance of both life and literature."3/10


                
We have witnessed another melancholic Two Towers tragedy. That is the second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'. This ring also fits into the hand of pathetic cinema just as the one of the previous fellowship. The film brings back all of its characters: hobbits Frodo & Sam, Gandalf the Wizard, hobbit defender Aragorn, and all the rest of these ludicrous characters who are more reminiscent of `ringling circus' animals than lords of rings.   My quest, just as it was last year, is for this ring version to get destroyed at Oscar night and not receive any major wins. * Failure
