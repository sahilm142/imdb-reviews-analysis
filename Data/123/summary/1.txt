 Just bad

 You MUST be joking.... OVERRATED

 What in the world is wrong with everyone that rated this?

 One of the worst movies ever made

 Pretentious, boring, never ending commonplace of a movie with bad acting from the protagonists

 Far-fetched, overwrought, and overacted

 Warning: This movie will be about an hour too long.

 Several problems...

 Over Directed, over acted

 Painfully nineties, but really just painful.

 Fooling some of the people all of the time......

 I can't watch this

 Goodness me!

 Face it...

 COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE A WORSE FILM?

 A truly dreadful load of rubbish

 Top 10 Worst movies of all times candidate

 A Totally Inane Remake

 I know bad when I see it ...........

 SHENANIGANS! DeNiro and Pacino do NOT appear together

 I am stunned
