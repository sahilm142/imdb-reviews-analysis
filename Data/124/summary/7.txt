 Contrived and Pointless

 Why was it necessary ?

 A bit confusing, actually...and a great illustration of the phrase 'TMI'

 as was the harrowing bus incident

 Not for everyone, but still an excellent story

 very cinema

 Searching a mother's past revives Lebanese tragedy

 Horrifying at times but a gripping story

 Overall impression + spoilers + my own ideas to improve the story :)

 I expected more

 Brilliantly directed portrayal of life in times of chaos marred by a flashy climax !!!

 Dark Roots

 Flowing slow-paced and devastating with great panoramic set-pieces.

 Search of everything...

 Effective if contrived

 If its title translates out of French and into English as "Scorched", then this is a near red-hot drama making the difficulties of taking this subject matter on look easy.

 Imagine When 1 + 1 Doesn't Equal 2
