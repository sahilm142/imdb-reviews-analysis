 A Misunderstood Series

 "Now Zoidberg is the popular one!"

 Futurama - One of God's Gift to Animation.

 The best cartoon series on TV ever

 Grade A Hilarity

 Can be watched till the end of time..

 I actually like it better than The Simpsons

 FUTURAMA is a great show that might come back...and should!

 Equal parts clever, hilarious, and moving, Futurama is the greatest animated series ever.

 Why did they ever cancel Futurama?

 Much Better Than the Simpsons. Smart and Hilarious.

 All hail, the NEW king of animated series.

 One of the best animated series EVER

 Thanks, Mr. Groening!

 One of the best cartoons around!

 Why did it have to be cancelled?

 "Another science fiction show cancelled before it's time."

 Absolutely Brilliant- the best TV series ever!

 Can I be honest? I think Futurama is better than the Simpsons!

 Best series ever

 How many shows can say they're better than the Simpsons and get away with it?

 Perhaps The Greatest Animated Show Ever On Television

 A shining beacon in a sea of crap TV

 Futurama is the best animated show behind The Simpsons.

 Pure Genius
