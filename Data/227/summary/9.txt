 Beautiful, terrifying

 compelling, eerie, intense, haunting, evocative, potent, sad, heroic

 Not as impressive as the original

 That bunny...

 Back to the Future...

 An interesting little gem

 The Mad World Of Donnie Darko

 Deeply Refreshing

 Dark and Beautiful, A great film

 paraphrase on the gospel

 Are the Creators considering a TV Series?

 Well done Richard Kelly. I think you've done it!

 Forget the theatrical version, buy the director's cut instead!

 time travel incidental

 One heck of an intelligent film!!

 Astounding!!

 "if you feel the need to vomit up there, just swallow it." "okay, mommy."

 Impressive and mysterious.

 I promise, that one day, everything's going to be better for you.

 Watch Donnie Darko

 I don't wanna be alone

 Victim of a space-time anomaly

 An imperfect favorite.

 Must watch. A cult movie

 "Life is one long insane trip. Some people just have better directions." — Donnie Darko.
