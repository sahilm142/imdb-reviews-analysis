A fairy flies around the face of an enthralled, fairy-loving girl for the first time, and she just looks straight ahead, smiling vaguely. Giant black bugs crawl up her arms and she ignores them. A terrible monster sits quietly at a food-laden dining table but ehhhh she's hungry so no need to even keep an eye on it. BUT OH when a thing hits a guy hard in the face yes of course the face breaks and blood squishes through the ruptures and his dad cries out in anguish and tries to reach for him and then the guy gets a bullet and more blood squirts out and then the dad gets shot too and more blood squirts out. Etc. etc. for two hours. The message: Fantasy is irrelevant; guns are reality.
I watched this moving again last night for the 2nd time, and I still don't understand the Hype. I don't understand why people are calling this a "masterpiece". It is not even close. It is a very entertaining film, and the cinematography is beautiful, but the story is completely lacking. The war scenes are very brutal and gory, and the fantasy scenes aren't for kids, but overall all I can say is the ONLY thing I can figure out in this movie, is that the young girl didn't want to face the harsh reality's of war, and created this Fantasy world to stick her feet into throughout the film.. I don't see any "hidden-meanings" within this film at all. The girl is just a kid, and kids go off in fantasy worlds when they don't want to deal with harsh realities... nothing more to it than that.The ending was pretty sad, but I was really really disappointed in the very end when she's at her "kingdom" - I mean, come on, hasn't this been done before??? Reminded me of the titanic ending when Rose meets Jack at the clock in the End...This movie took 2 films, A typical war film and a Typical Fantasy film, and put it together.. and its a masterpiece? I'm sorry, I tried with this film, I really did... I just didn't see the Brilliance in it at all. I consider Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddessey, a Masterpiece.. THIS isn't even on the same scale as that...Pan's labrynth is entertaining at best, but not a masterpiece.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Despite going more commercial with the Hellboy films, Spanish special effects wunderkind Gullirmo Del Toro has probably made more of a name for himself with this cult, subversive independent film set against the backdrop of Franco's Spain. Shot in his native homeland, with no doubt a fraction of the budget, he's still managed to produce some incredible special effects that are truly a wonder to the eye and mind. And his tale of a young girl caught between the conflict of a band of freedom fighters and the fascist dictatorship her father is part of who escapes into a wonderful fantasy land to escape the harsh reality of her existence has promise and a pleasant charm all of it's own. Sadly, I could not get involved in the plot at all and it simply failed to engage me through-out. Still, it's made an impression on many others and is likely to remain a cult classic for some time to come. **


                
I was very intrigued with plot, camera work and visual effects at the movie beginning, however all plot lines were spoiled one by one until nothing even mediocre remained from the movie at the end. I feel very upset, because visual effects and camera work remained astonishing throughout the movie. Fantastic and magical ideas and scenes appeared from time to time, but incredibly illogical plot turns have broken each scene experience. Overall plot looks crafted and quite unnatural. I found several scenes displaying extraordinary violence unneeded and over-the-top, they made the movie look more like a trash one. Actors' performance was very mediocre: only the Captain was good, the girl didn't look very scared when she should absolutely have to.Anyways, I would recommend this movie, because so many people enjoyed it, but don't expect too much.


                
EXTREME SPOILERS: Pan's Labyrinth in a nutshell: a little girl dies because fascists are bad. Her stepfather does every evil thing imaginable; torture, misogyny, and intense shaving constitute his daily routine. Short of eating babies (that's reserved for floppy-skinned monsters that put their own eyes on plates), there's nothing he won't do to ensure that the noble revolutionaries hiding in the woods die without any dignity or unswollen eyes. He's portrayed with zero subtlety or sympathy; he can't even die when stabbed in the heart, he's so evil.I kept wondering, why is this man portrayed the same way as a Disney villain? The answer: Guillermo del Toro set out, with this movie, to warn the world's masses that anyone who is anti-Communist is exactly like this man.Why am I giving so much attention to the historical fiction facet of the film rather than the fantasy elements? Because the movie gives just as much time to them, maybe twenty percent of the entire 112-minute running time. The few scenes in the fairy-tale subplot are visually imaginative but irrelevant to the larger point of the movie: fascism is bad.At the end of the film, the audience is led to believe that this girl's imagination has provided some sort of redemption from her brutal surroundings.Wow. The profundity is overwhelming. People imagine that they end up as royalty and not middle-class corpses? I'd have never thought of that without you, Guillermo! Pan's Labyrinth is just another cog in the wheel of the artsy crowd's anti-right wing obsession. Like an exterminator wielding a 300-pound sledgehammer to smash a long-dead housefly, wannabe avant-garde directors keep using big-budget films to preach to the world that, yes indeed, fascism during World War II was bad. I, personally, would love to see a new generation of filmmakers with the cojones to speak out against the fascists of the world today, including the Communists of Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, et al. However, if del Toro would face up to the fact that more than one side of the political spectrum rules oppressively, then he would drown in his tears realizing how pointless and obsolete Pan's Labyrinth is.
All over the newspapers, TV, and the internet you see the ad for this movie: a little girl standing in a room with a weird-looking creature sitting at a table. So you think "wow, I've got to see that." Yes, there are weird creatures in this movie, but their screen time is brief. The film is largely a standard wartime drama, and the brutality of the Franco regime is shown repeatedly just in case you don't get it the first dozen times. Ever see a man beaten to death with a liquor bottle? It's just one of the three hundred scenes calculated to foment your anger at fascism and the concomitant loss of individual freedom.There are some startling images in this movie, among them a gigantic frog and a man mending a slice in his face, but you'll spend most of your time wondering what atrocity el capitan will commit next. The suspense is there, certainly, but all the while you'll be wondering: where are the strange creatures I was promised, and how do they fit into the plot? The answer is, they don't.Yes, this is one of those duality films where all the cool stuff that is going on exists only in the head of the main character Ofelia, in other words, that most boring of themes: individualistic escapism. The film seems to be saying that during times of oppression, it's okay to seek solace in fantasy. In the meantime, a very real rebellion is occurring in the mountains of Spain. This is why the film doesn't work: everything going on inside Ofelia's head has nothing whatsoever to do with the Franco resistance. Del Toro makes sure that the audience has no clue that this duality exists until the very end, where it is shown that Ofelia can see the faun and el capitan cannot.There's nothing original to be seen here. Even some of the special effects are Harry Potteresque, such as the mandrake and the book with invisible ink.What is the point to all this? It's a lot of brutal, ugly images that add up to a whole lot of nothing. In a year or so, people will look back and wonder why they voted this movie a "10".
Guillermo Del Toro's latest foray into the grim and fantastic underworld of the human imagination is probably best described as the mutant cousin to 2001's Gothic hit "The Devil's Backbone." The latter was a beautiful, chilling thriller, pitting a child against the horrors of wartime in Spain. The former, "Pan's Labyrinth," continues in the same vein, but Del Toro seems to have lost his focus. The result is a topsy-turvy morass of a film that becomes increasingly ridiculous and offensive as the run-time unfurls.The central character, Ofelia, played by Spanish newcomer Ivana Banquero, is a child isolated by the harshness of conflict during the Spanish Civil War. Her imagination runs wild, but her Gothic fictions<U+0097>obvious defense-mechanisms against reality<U+0097>become corporeal with the help of a mystical fawn, Pan, who resides in a hidden forest labyrinth. While Ofelia embarks on a secret mission, people around her drop like flies due to the sadistic practices of Captain Vidal, her malicious step-father. Vidal, a highly ranked officer in the Francisco Franco regime, will do anything to protect his legacy and his autocratic way of life. Del Toro uses him to underscore the idea that the greatest villains exist not just in dreams but also in waking life.Banquero, the lone child in the cast, who was 11 when "Pan's Labyrinth" was shot, is very convincing as Ofelia and deftly handles a challenging role. Sergi López ("Dirty Pretty Things") and Maribel Verdú ("Y tu Mamá También"), playing Captain Vidal and servant Mercedes, respectively, turn out visceral performances. But a flawed plot overshadows these strengths.The juxtaposition of light, saccharine moments with repulsive, horrific scenes makes the dark, dramatic "Labyrinth" almost comical. Elements of the film that Del Toro intends to be poignant come off as flimsy and manipulative. Also, the trials Ofelia must undergo in the fantasy world are far from challenging. In fact, we are given little incentive to believe in the necessity for their completion. The prize is said to be eternal life in the dream world. Nevertheless, despite the grim landscape of war-torn Spain, Ofelia seems loathe to separate from her mother and the only life she's ever known<U+0097>and why shouldn't she when her dreamscapes are at times nightmarish and intensely claustrophobic?While "Pan's Labyrinth" can be applauded for its richly textured imagery, it falls short of reaching the narrative heights of other recent Del Toro films. Not even the input of Alfonso Cuarón, who produced the film, seems to have helped. In fact, one might question whether "Labyrinth" was a failed attempt at mating horror with "Harry Potter." Such an experiment requires a fine alchemist to get the balance right. In this case, the alchemist mixed ingredients to suit two audiences that have radically different tastes. What we're left with is a witch's brew. A fairytale ending doesn't always offer redemption.Copyright (c) 2006 by Lauren Simpson


                
A girl goes nuts and dies, the end.
Everything in between was some kind of nonsense delusion, so it meant nothing and so should be ignored.
As a result, in terms of actual stuff happening in the world of the film, it was about a 5 minute movie, plus a ridiculously long dream sequence in the middle.
While the idea of contrasting a dark fairy tale with a dark political story of rebellion is quite ingenious, the film ends up being extremely empty and drags far too often. As strong as the performances are the lack of any kind of depth in the mother character results in a lack of sympathy for Ofelia because we never really understand what she's doing all of this for, though I did get teary at the end. The fact that Captain Vidal has absolutely no positive qualities is utterly ridiculous since no one is that sadistic and terrible (even Anton Chigurh showed signs of sympathy) and made the more realistic parts of the story seem that much more unbelievable. The strength of the performances and the jaw-dropping technical aspects can't entirely save a film when it feels so hollow. The ending did manage to bring quite a smile to my face, though.


                
Sometimes I wonder if critics even notice anything except the cinematography. I mean, I think I could film someone killing a guinea pig, but if it were filmed with a beautiful camera the critics would love it. Because other than nice camera-work, this movie has nothing going for it. And I mean NOTHING.First, I'll start with the boring factor. This has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen: no doubt at all. DO NOT think this is a fantasy movie like Lord of the Rings mixed with Saw-like violence. There are literally only 4 fantasy scenes, and each last maybe 10 minutes tops. The rest of the movie is nothing but boring conversation.Secondly, I was told by countless people this movie was violent. And trust me when I say this: if you've played any T-rated video game, you've seen more violence in 5 minutes than there is in this entire movie put together. It did not even earn its R-rating, much less be considered a "hard R" as I was told. Also, the violence is NOT in the fantasy sequences, it's in the war sequences . . . which made it seem like a toned down (but darker) Saving Private Ryan. And that's not a good thing.Third, the cliché factor. It is falsely called an "original" movie by critics. I'm sorry, but there is nothing to see here that you haven't seen in PG-rated movies like The Chronicles of Narnia or E-rated games like Zelda. The ending was such a cliché I wanted to slam my fist into the TV because I was so disappointed.So why do I give this movie a 2 and not 0? Because as much as I hated the movie itself, I agree strongly with the idea behind it: fairy tales are bloody, dark, and for adults as well as children. Guillermo Del Toro failed miserably with this movie, but with his ideology, his skill, and his memories of a traumatized past, I know in the future he can make something that is truly stellar.But don't expect this to be that movie. Try again, Guillermo.4/10
OK guys I understand the story of the king and queen, I understand Spanish civil war and peasants and doctors. I understand technical movements and special effects. I understand the concept that children live in their own world and their fantasies go hand in hand with their surroundings. I understand that fawn in this film is not Pan BUT for goodness sake please tell me what is this film about? It reminded me of Full Metal Jacket. Its like watching two films. Of course there is a big difference in FMJ as both films are related but in this case there is just no connection. Its like watching 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Lords of the Rings' simultaneously. Of course both not as good as these two great flicks. Very overrated flick. the only reason you wanna watch this film is for the Phalanges movement. Its a spoiler. A balloon which inflates and burst without a sound.
Warning! Many Spoilers Ahead!This has to be one of the most depressing movie's I've seen in a long time. The acting was decent, but the story (the one in the real world, not the fantasy world) was just too disheartening to watch, even for those who are slightly braver than simply being faint of heart. One who are expecting an engaging invitation to a creative fantasy realm will be sorely disappointed, as most of the screen time (well over half, I would wager) is spent with the army officer who is the protagonist's stepfather. We see scene after scene of his cold, heartless brutality, both towards his wife and stepdaughter, as well as to anti-Franco revolutionaries (just to split hairs for a moment: this movie takes place a few years after the Spanish Civil War had ended and Franco had taken power. I say this just in case anyone thought this a movie about the Spanish Civil War). There are a couple of scenes of grotesque violence, one of which is a disturbingly realistic lip-cutting scene. We see the officer's wound before he sows it up: his mouth looks like that of a gory H.R. Pufnstuf. After his wound has been sown shut, we still see him reel in agony as he bleeds from it. This is simply one reason parents should be wary if they think about taking kids to see this. The officer will give them nightmares for a long time.The fantasy realm into which the girl escapes is, from what I could deduce, a metaphor for overcoming the madness of the Franco regime, and fascist dictatorships in general. Those wanting to indulge in a fantasy movie like "The Chronicles of Narnia", "The Lord of the Rings", or even "The Neverending Story" will be very disappointed, as the fantasy is not given the screen time one would have hoped, nor is the fantasy world richly developed. The faun's magic realm is supposed to be the girl's way of coping with the brutality of her stepfather, but we see only a few glimpses of it, and it is not juxtaposed well with the scenes of the revolutionaries or the sadistic stepfather. In short, the audience is left craving more of the girl's magic world. Many of the "real world" scenes do not blend in well as a dichotomy with the girl's imaginary world, and the film suffers for it.In short, the grim storyline and constantly depressing scenes, without so much as a simple moment of comic relief or humor to break the tension, makes this a rather difficult movie to watch. It is simply a dark art house movie thinly masquerading as a fantasy film (at least in promotional art). I do not recommend this for families who want to bring along the kids or fans of fantasy and science fiction. Those adults with a more intellectual bent or those who take pleasure in watching art-house movies may enjoy "Pan's Labyrinth." In all, the audience for this film seems rather limited.


                
I like fantasy movies, I like historic pieces. This movie has both of these categories combined in one, but this fact didn't help me understand it. Maybe there isn't a lot to understand, as the movie tells the story of a captain chasing Guerilla fighters in Franco's Spain (historic part), while his little step-daughter, when alone, lives in a fairy world trying to complete tasks set-up by a faun (fantasy part). If this in fact it, in my opinion, this movie is pretty much pointless. While photographed beautifully, the graphic display of violence is inappropriate. Another thing, I don't get, is how highly this movie is rated. Lately, it seems, that you can't get a high rating, if your movie isn't dark, gritty and depressing. The ratings are misleading, they certainly misled me to watching it. If you're looking for something, that will make you sad and depressed and maybe even a little disgusted by the over-usage of violence, go see this movie, otherwise, stay clear.


                
Yes, "simply crap", and I'm not afraid to say it, in spite of the "critics" who made this movie jump in the IMDb Top 250. Does this movie tell a story as beautiful as Forrest Gump? Ask yourself that question frankly. Yet Forrest Gump is lower in the top than this stretch of blood, violence, and unrelated intermeshed dark fantasy and brutal war themes.As to the reason why so many people voted this movie so high, I can only speculate: the nowadays public thirst for the violent, the fantastic and the unconventional (i.e. foreign films), in a desire to escape the everyday routine. After Hollywood producing some platitudes, or perhaps after the public getting bored with movies that simply entertain you, anything that's foreign is automatically looked up to. Same thing with the lame attempt at porn, the string of cuss words which is Y Tu Mama Tambien.If any of these movies were American, only the closet sadists would sit through more than 15 minutes of them.


                
This is a review from SPINANDSTIR.com.American audiences are most familiar with director Guillermo del Toro because of his two films "Blade 2" and "Hellboy", although he also directed a small horror film, "Mimic". But close fans know that the director from his Mexican roots where he made personal fantasy/ horror films, at a smaller budget. Now with his 7 million dollar "Pan's Labyrinth", shot in Spain, he has once again returned to those roots. But perhaps all his time in Hollywood has skewed his view of what a personal film is as "Pan's Labyrinth" suffers from tone and focus issues.The story follows a young girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother, Carmen (Adriana Gil), as they travel to the compound/home of Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), Carmen's new husband and Ofelia's adoptive father. During 1944, the Captain lives in the North of Spain and is surrounded by soldiers who fight off post-war rebels who are not happy with the Fascist regime. On the property Ofelia, who has a wild imagination and loves to read fiction, discovers a labyrinth that seems to hide some mystery. Soon she is met by a grasshopper creature that leads her into the labyrinth to meet Pan, a faun, who informs her she carries the soul of a princess who must now open a portal and go back to her father, the King. In order to open the portal she will have to carry out a series of dangerous tasks including getting a giant frog to spit up a key, avoiding a man with no eyes, and ultimately making a sacrifice. While Ofelia works her way through this fantasy world (which may in fact be real), the real world is torn apart as Carmen struggles with her pregnancy, Captain Vidal, a military monster, who tortures and kills rebels. The fantasy world and real world collide when Ofelia tries to open the portal in Pan's Labyrinth.From the previews one might assume that this film offers a dark, almost "Dark Crystal" like, children's fairy tale. But be warned that this is barely digestible for an adult. There is plenty of gruesome violence both in the real world, with the Captain torturing rebels, and in the fantasy world, where a creature stuffs eyes into his hands and tries to kill Ofelia. It's not just the violence that is throughout the movie, but also the tense tone of not knowing what could happen next. Although this is probably very true to the nature of living in 1944 Spain, post- war, where you don't know who to trust and military personnel are abusing their power, it does beg the question: is this a post-war drama or a little girl's dark fantasy film? I would say the film tries to be both, utilizing some parallels and overlaps in order to justify mixing the two. But I feel this is the greatest downfall of the film because there's not have enough room in its 2 hour running time to handle both.If I had to choose I would have opted for the fantasy film. Not just because visually that was often more inventive, or because it offers more escape, but because it would have been more effective at addressing the themes that are hit over our head in the non-fantasy scenes. It is far for more effective for us to gain understanding of what is wrong in post-war Spain from the perspective of innocent eyes, like those of Ofelia, then see it directly. Think of "Alice in Wonderland" or the kids of "The Secret Garden". They are not aware of what war really is, or how military politics play in. All they know is that they'd prefer to live in a fantasy world where they are a princess whose real father is waiting for them through a portal, then have to live in the real, depressing, world. When Ofelia is given the challenges and set on her journey there is plenty of opportunity to inform us through the creatures she meets, the environment in the fantasy world, and the rewards at the end as to how she feels and views the real world. Instead the filmmakers have to cut back and forth showcasing Vidal's brutality, Carmen's pregnancy troubles, and war in general. Each of these showcased scenes could have easily been hinted at and then left to be shown in the fantasy world. We don't need multiple torture scenes, near miscarriages, and rebel shootouts to let us know what is wrong in this world. So although I am making a suggestion as to another way to have made the film, I am merely pointing out that there are two films struggling to be heard and, together, they don't mix well enough to work.READ more at www.spinandstir.com.
This is not a good movie, it's an okay movie.The Devil's Backbone was a masterpiece; it made me into a Del Toro fan and, since then, his films have gone rapidly downhill.Del Toro's technique is sloppy and amateurish in this film. I can't count how many times the camera tracked into a dark object and bam! there we were in a different shot or scene.This is the work of a hack, plain and simple.I don't hate this film, it does have some great moments, but not nearly enough to justify the hub-bub, I just hate the pseudo-intellectuals that suddenly think they're film connoisseurs that are talking about it everywhere I go. It's not bad, but let's not kid ourselves, it's not high art either.This movie just has a HUGE marketing push and it finally gives U.S. audiences a foreign film that they like and that makes them feel smart.Good for you America, you can read... now get some taste.


                
Critics and audiences would be eager to tell you that Guillermo Del Toro's Fantasy/War drama "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best modern fairy tales since (Insert Tim Burton flick here). But make sure to ignore these claims, for they would be based on lies. Further examination reveals that "Pan's Labyrinth" is in fact as inartistic and intellectually spurious as they come. This film was made by a Grad A PHONY, and here's why.Fantasy scenes are annoyingly superfluous, having little to no connection to the war happening around her (which is, of course, presented in completely black and white terms with the honourable reds fighting off the despicable fascists). We are expected to believe that Ophelia created this world around her to escape from the harsh reality of war, but in the end it is clear that the ambiguity is simply a redundant 'open ending' to the story that leaves the filmmakers thinking they were oh so smart to allow the audience to see it one way or the other. The attempt to weave together two threads of graphic violence and childlike fairytale comes across as amateurish. Why does one want to watch something that is presented as a fairy tale (it doesn't matter that it's a dark one, so was Alice in Wonderland) when it feels like a mere afterthought to the human drama that is unfolding? The film's attempt to mesh these together by including horror elements in the fairy tale parts is cheap popcorn schlock. A predictable monster with a wobbly walk, a giant toad (creative), and a tree root. Big whoop.I found Del Toro's attempts to blend fantasy and reality to be quite ham fisted and lazy. There was practically a total of three fantastical things in this movie, and none of them were that creative or imaginative, except for the baby eating demon with hands for eyes. But even that was just a ridiculous premise and essentially served no other purpose other than to look strange. All of the 'tasks' that Ofelia goes through in no way challenge her character or reveal any insight into the conflict of the film. There are no riddles, no real challenges, just basically follow some simple directions and everything just happens magically and for no discernible reason. Not to mention the connection between the 'real' world and the fantasy land is annoyingly superfluous, and at worst, entirely pointless.The moral of the film should have been that the fear of the imagination/fairytale is far less reprehensible than the evil of man. Unfortunately, the battlefield scenes and Captain Vidal are completely one note. One half on the battlefield, one half in fantasy land, neither truly working. Both sides of this film are half baked. He should have concentrated on one aspect. If there is one thing Guillermo really revels in, it is the graphic violence that sadistically blunts any point the film could have made, from the over-the-top demolition of a man's face with a wine bottle, the execution of a child, to the melodramatic way everyone hangs in the air for 2 seconds after having their brains blown out before dropping dead.The film paints its depiction of evil in broad strokes of black and white, particularly with the one dimensional character of Captain Vidal. Of course, the honourable Republicans are completely valiant and noble. It is laughably one-sided. There is really no point of connection between the two universes, as they share little poetic relationship between one another. Del Toro should either have made a war drama, or a child's fantasy. The result at his poor attempt to combine the two was basically him trying to have his cake and eat it too.Eventually, the gratuitous gore and paper thin characterizations just made the film a chore to sit through. I'd rather watch Spirit of the Beehive than sit through PL again. If this film wasn't in Spanish, we wouldn't think it was so artsy.
I saw it yesterday and I would like to say what I think here. I do not think this is a good movie. I did not liked the screenplay and the cinematography. The screenplay was somewhat dull for me, like if it was not exactly finished. The characters are way too dumb to be real and the mistakes they make does not fit on their own personality. Taking for granted the Doctor that says to the rebels that it is impossible to win against the captain and some time later he sign his own death sentence offending the captain in front of his men. The lighting is good, but the film is too cold for the movie. The outdoor scenes are very plain due to the lack of color saturation. I believe the Pan was a very colorful character but one cannot see this due to the overall coldness of the shooting. The movie is not bad either, but in my opinion it has serious flaws and if this was a typical Hollywood production instead of a cult movie the criticism would be unforgiving.
It's sad the such a distortioned and stereotyped depicting of the 1940's Spain become the main protagonist of the movie. The "real" characters of the movie become more fantastic than the fauns and fairies of the tale.That fairy tale visioned by the little girl which should have been the engine of the movie, start to stutter in the middle of the trip to stalled completely at the end. The "happy" end is just a quick fix for a story that wasn't working and was difficult to develop all the way.The mis-en-scène was very good, so was the art direction and Ofelia's role. But the whole result of the movie was very disappointing for a film with such nice effects and good film-making.


                
well, we saw this film over the long weekend. I was under the impression by my fellow movie mate, that is was a lord of the ring type movie-and he was dead wrong. this movie is a dark and twisted tale, and I did not care for it myself. I hate sub titles, by the end of the film I was sick from reading all of the bunk. the story was strange and bizarre, and you had to read too much into the plot-or lack there of. it was dark and just plain silly at times. I have seen many films-this was the most horrific as far as violence goes ( too much violence is Not a good thing) not for some one with a weak stomach. see if it you want a headache by the end of the show or maybe rent it, with the option to turn it off 2/3 of the way through


                
This is a strange movie. In some regards, it is very well made -- acting, direction, editing are very well done. But I hope you don't see this movie for these reasons -- because the story is sick, sick, sick.The violence of the war portion of the movie is over-the-top. There is so much disgusting unnecessary violence that it merits its own description: sicko-bleedo. As other critical reviews here have said, the war story has no redeeming qualities, no characters that I would want to meet and talk with. Likewise the fantasy story is without value, only a pastiche of fantasy elements that never come into a living, breathing life.What is more troubling to me is the very high rating and awards this twisted movie has gotten. I am concerned about what is happening to the taste of American moviegoers. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It has perfected my growing concerns -- I no longer trust the IMDb rating system to guide me.This movie is without soul; or rather, perhaps it has a soul, dark, noxious, cold. A slouching beast. What Yeats says applies here: "the ceremony of innocence is drowned"; the child is unable to live alive in either world. Better to read his poem.


                
I was disappointed with El Laberinto del Fauno. I was expecting a different film from all of the reviews I had read, including the many Oscar nominations.I actually left about an hour into the film because I was so disgusted by the unnecessary violence, and I just couldn't handle the graphic murders. A man being beaten in the face with a bottle until he was dead is not something that any human needs to see. In Canada it was rated as 14A, and should have been rated R.This film's trailers and reviews exposed it as a whimsical adult fairy tale, although it contained more death than a James Bond movie.Though I though the movie was Nightmare worthy, Ivana Baquero was very believable and did a fantastic job in playing Ofelia.


                
After watching the trailer I expected a fairy tail movie with a bunch of nice CG and lovely imagery. Instead I had to endure two hours of boring, old school military ignorance mixed with violent historic gun battles, and a main character with the IQ of a rotten tomato. Where was all the magic promised in the ads?I also failed to see how this movie was anything more then a boring one.from here on I am just adding lines so it works to submit this thingbla bla bla -------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

I was very surprised to see this movie getting so many good reviews and nominations after I saw a sneak preview last night. While I consider myself open minded, especially to fantasy content, I thought this movie was pretty funny. Funny in the sense of having the urge to laugh without being able to stop it. While I really liked the "real" part of the story I totally disliked the "fantasy" part of it. I convinced myself at first, that this was the only way for the girl to escape from the horrible and cruel reality but then it was too strange on the other hand to be just that. The real-world storyline would have made a great movie, exciting and full of statements about the human condition, but the other part was ridiculous. The cinematography wasn't bad in every single scene for itself, but put together it was a little bit overdone. Too many panning shots and repetitions in the camera movements. I really liked the sadistic fascist stepfather character, because it was not a pure monster but a character you could believe in. I have to admit, that the characters were all very well written and the actors underlined this by a very good performance but this horrible story! I can't get over it. I really had to laugh out loudly when I saw the child-eating monster with eyes in his hand. And the fact that the girl had to eat the grapes, leading to just another violent episode, was just unnecessary. And that is exactly the point. This "fairy-tale" was completely ruined by violence and gross scenes. There the fantasy should have been a contrast to the violent reality, which was crass but realistic and believable. Instead it was topped by the fantasy world. And this is exactly why I came to the conclusion that this wasn't just a little girls attempt to flee reality. (besides the complete lack of rational behavior or logic in some of the characters actions). All in all it was a combination of good actors, bad story and overdone cinematography that leads me to only one advice: DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE!
Long mystified by this film's grand reputation, I watched it for the second time yesterday, and the nicest thing I can think to say, really, is: I don't get it. Maybe that's because I can't easily dismiss plot devices and plot holes, even if they're part of an elaborate fantasy. Guillermo del Toro is trying to have it both ways-- Brothers Grimm-style fantasy and the actual Spanish Civil War. Unfortunately, the fantasy is a virtuoso display of grotesque characters and a relish of cruelty that makes Hannibal Lecter seem like a faintly decadent gourmand, while the Spanish Civil War was no more real to me in this film than WWII was in the brilliant opening sequence of Del Toro's pure fantasy, "Hellboy."At no point did I take the human characters seriously, especially not the relentlessly evil Colonel (Sergi López). He's the equivalent of Grimms' cruel stepmothers, which is as thin as fantasy gets. Three particular things bothered me, not all of which can be written off as fantasy or a child's viewpoint -- if it is a child's viewpoint. Adolescent Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is the heroine, but powerful Pan (Doug Jones) is the voice-over narrator.1. When the mother (Ariadna Gil) tells her daughter that real life is hard, not like the fairy tales that Ofelia devours, I waited for some evidence to support such a claim. Ofelia's fairy tales are gruesome and repellent-- as bad or worse as anything in real life. 2. Toward the end, the housekeeper (Maribel Verdú) viciously stabs the Colonel, first in the back, then chest, shoulder, and mouth. The wounds leave him at her mercy-- but she doesn't finish him off. Given her risky loyalty to the rebels he's battling, and her willingness to stab him four times, the only reason for stopping short of murder has to be to set up more brutality. So the Colonel survives only to be almost-killed again. Indeed, he emerges from the quadruple stabbing strong as ever except for a bloody shirt, a bandaged lip, and a firearm. If you'll notice, the plot wouldn't change an iota if she hadn't stabbed him at all. The same is true a little later, when Ofelia poisons the Colonel. He staggers a bit in his bloody shirt, but in the next scene, he's back in fine form, gun in hand.3. The movie really lost me at the end. When the godlike character on the throne says to Bardo Ofelia, "Arise, my daughter. Come. You have spilled your own blood rather than the blood of an innocent. That was the final task and the most important." The blood she spared was that of her infant brother. But she's, what?, 12? That's not an innocent? Given that the actress who played Ofelia was at "the bud-stage of breast development," as Humbert said of Lolita, I actually wondered if puberty is being referenced there, as the loss of innocence, the end of childhood. Probably not, since it's not an issue anywhere else in the movie. Anyway, the point is, in war, most if not all children are innocent.I have not yet seen del Toro's latest, The Shape of Water, which is getting high praise as I write. But at this point, with the dominance of sensational visuals over coherent ideas in his work, I'm beginning to think Guillermo del Toro is Spanish for Tim Burton.
