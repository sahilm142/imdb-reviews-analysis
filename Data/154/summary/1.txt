 well if this isn't the American Nightmare

 8.3 rating on this movie? how?

 Is this supposed to be good ?

 Absolute Trash

 If you need some stereotype in your life go and see Warrior

 an 8.3? 8.3? 8.3? 8.3? 8.3? But no, it can not be, there is no way...no, no, no, no, I will not accept sheeples' scores

 It's not worth more than 5.5 rating

 I created this account specifically to review this film...

 Horrid Movie

 Cheesy & corny, but proves a huge point

 Fantastic Jean-Claude Van Damme movie from the early 90's!

 Are You Kidding Me!?!? This Got An 8.3 Rating!! This Movie Is Terrible!

 Oh dear

 Boring Waste Of Time Don't waste your money

 neither a motivational movie nor a entertaining(Time waste)

 Awful

 Worst ending ever

 Brenden should have died

 excellent movie ... ruined

 One of the most over rated films I've ever seen

 Don't they check sound quality before releasing?

 One more American lousy movie

 Waste of 2 hours

 A no one beating professional fighters??

 Are you kidding me
