 Expectations unmet. Not bad, but not a game-changer either.

 Casting error

 An Adaptation of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead

 Billionaire Cartoon

 It is interesting but...

 Its not one of those shows that is getting better with every episode

 Started strong, but...

 Bravado, Four Letter Words, Threats

 who cast John Malkovich?

 Season 3 letdown

 Like all tales of moral and ethical turpitude, there is seduction in the air.
