Read review of another user so I decided to check it out - looked interesting but soon found it very difficult to understand what she was saying. Repeated it many times at higher volumes still not clear. She mumbles. Then a scene came up, still in the first few minutes of the pilot where she was eating and mumbling eating and mumbling. That was enough for me.Hopefully the producers of this venture will understand that an ability to speak from a stage and be heard in the back rows is a prerequisite for a leading roll in a new series. If I was going to say how bad it was, I would have to say that it is "Submarine (2010)" bad. When the movie is released with an another actor reading the lines of the primary character.It is not issue with the actor's accent because other actors have accents - its a lack of energy placed into the annunciation by the actor and perhaps the frustration of the director to get a better performance from the actor and a greater emphasis is being placed on just finishing the shot and moving on. Sad that a show's creator's efforts and a writer's talents cannot be successful delivered to an audience - it looked promising.
