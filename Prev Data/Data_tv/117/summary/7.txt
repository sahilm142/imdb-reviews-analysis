 Shameless US/UK Comparison

 Highs and lows but mostly good.

 Preferred earlier seasons

 The series title says it all

 To anyone that thinks it went off the deep end

 William H Macy is making a Freddo

 Great show but not realistic and a relies on shock

 Good

 Would have given a much higher rating, but......

 William H. Macy is the weak link
