 It's Just a House

 One of the finest films I've ever seen

 Another Feast For The Eyes

 What a joy to watch

 A Surrealistic Adventure Full of Sentiments

 Families should "Catch Up".

 Almost perfect if not for:

 Looks fantastic. Slight plot niggles!

 No one is too old to live an adventure

 Dream never dies...

 A perfect 10 except for just two things...

 Best first ten minutes of any film

 An all out fun ride

 Up

 Up soars with adventure above the rest!

 A masterful tale with meaning to boot!

 "I have just met you and I love you!"

 A Movie Made for 3D Animation- Great Fantasy Film Overall

 Pixar keep on going Up

 Remembering its genre, it is a remarkable achievement.

 A humane story amid a color riot

 Buoyed dreams

 The beauty of pixar just a bit more "grown-up"

 I can't believe an animated movie made me cry....

 Delightful, sweet and charming : another Pixar classic
