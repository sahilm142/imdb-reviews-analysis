 The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times

 My favourite movie

 An adventure story, replacing six-shooters or swords with laser guns and horses with rockers<U+0085>

 A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away<U+0085>

 Though not as fresh and eye opening today,it's still a great film.

 The beginning of hope

 The first fantasy

 Simplistic Sophistication Makes for Universal Admiration and Appeal

 What really gets me

 Brilliant, entertaining space epic of good versus evil

 Star Wars felt big even before it was

 A classic tale of heroism, of magic and revenge

 An ultimate classic that still holds up.

 game changer, but the saga peaked at the start

 Classic Science Fiction

 This film holds up

 Luke Skywalker joins the Force to fight against Darth Vader and the evil empire in order to bring peace in the universe.

 This will be a day long remembered - a review 33 years in the making

 A break from the cynical films of the 1970s

 Pure uncut escapism

 My favorite movie

 great film

 The First of a great series

 A Long Time Ago, It Started

 Easily the best movie in the Star Wars-saga
