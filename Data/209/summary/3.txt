 An overly long, grim and obvious drama with a lack of characters

 plot holes that could swallow Nevada

 Was I watching a different film to most other people?

 A thriller for dumb people

 not good as the trailer

 The 7 Deadly Sins of PRISONERS

 Great promise but lazy execution

 Below average.

 Prejudiced story about Justice for the few. **warning spoilers**

 The most predictable, depressing genre of movie on the planet

 Good Actors, Good Acting, bad film

 Definitely went too far

 Wow, that's one really overrated movie

 Disappointing

 A real dud

 Maze of Plot Holes

 Could have been a good film

 Stupid and Boring

 Good film until the awful ending

 Good Actors ,Random Story, Bad Acting , Bad End

 Experienced movie watcher

 A Dark, Ugly Nightmare

 Mostly Well Executed Film I felt was Seriously Unrealistic and in Poor Taste
