 Requiem for a disappointment...

 confusing "high" art with substance

 un-believable

 Style cannot make up unoriginal substance

 Wanna-be art; really just crap

 a wannabe Trainspotting

 Truly Unpleasant

 Way, way, way over rated

 Tries too hard.

 Absent: most things that make film great!

 Longest anti-drug ad you'll see in your life.

 Brilliantly awful

 'Reefer Madness' with technical flourishes: the subject deserves better handling

 depressing morality tale with sledgehammer shock tactic approach but nothing new to offer

 Great Ending! (Warning: Spoilers)

 Unnecessarily grotesque

 very odd

 over-editing

 Overglamorized after-school special.

 High on the incredulity scale.

 Decent but should not be in the top 100.

 Nonsensical feel-bad move

 over-hyped

 An interesting project that disappears up its creative arse

 D-E-P-R-E-S-S-I-N-G!!!
