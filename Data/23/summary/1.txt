 An overrated but sporadically very good suspense thriller

 Very Overrated, dare i say "mediocre" film

 Silence of the Hams

 The psychopathology is all wrong.

 ham ham and more ham

 One of the most overrated movies ever.

 This movie SUCKED

 sickening, disturbing to the human spirit

 I hate this movie with a passion

 One word: boooooooooring

 Decent movie but WAY to overrated

 The Silence of the Lambs is an engrossing picture with no ending.

 Worst actress of all time....

 A movie that I despised.

 sophisticated and suave

 I hate this movie
