I suppose there is nothing wrong with the Ron Howard school of myth-making. But for me it is so tedious and masturbatory that I can't sit through it. As much as I loved the Apollo missions this markup is just too ludicrous to be taken seriously. The first episodes are actually not too bad. But as the initial favorable reviews came in the producers must have felt they'd gained ehough Spielberg-Glow powers to call in scriptwriters from every cornball corner of the middle-American galaxy. Too bad, it is a story worth telling. I listened to the audiobook which is straight-forward accounting of history vastly superior to this mushy mash-up.
