 I couldn't stay awake

 Dishonest Hollywood fluff

 Somebody please help me

 A decent movie, a poor Tolkien adaptation

 Utter Failure

 Would You Die Already!

 A great disappointment

 Average at best, not worthy of a spot in top 250 films

 Action movie yes, a classic ? not in my life

 Peter Jackson, not Tolkien, knows best??? Whatever. Awful!

 WHAT A JOKE!

 An adaptation of the book?

 Silly and Unsubtle

 Poorly adapted...

 The most over-hyped movie of all-time.

 Lousy and seemingly endless!

 Down with Ring Fanatics!

 Very overrated!!

 BEST FILM EVER?? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SMOKING???

 Another special effects disaster

 Not for the weak-stomached - this schlock will make you puke

 Thinly disguised b-movie

 MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!

 Poor movie

 bad execution
