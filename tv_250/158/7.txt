Dragon Ball is a Anime based on a Manga by Akira Toryiama (say that 3 times fast)Unlike it's sequel it Actually has quite the charm Goku,Yamcha,Tien,Krillin,Roshi,etc are all likable characters and that's why it's so enjoyable! The fights are also a high point in this show I love the fight with the final villains (not gonna spoil it) and how it makes you feel for the characters is amazing!However despite all that good listed above there are many flaws for example The plot isn't the best it's better then the one in the sequel but is fairly simple If you came for a good plot then this isn't for you.Another one is well in the grand scheme of things in anime it doesn't even come close to many other Shonenes such as ''Naruto,One Piece'' or non anime's like Avatar the last air benderHowever this show is worth checking out and I recommend it
