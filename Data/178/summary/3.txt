 I am astonished by the reviews and score

 Overrated, not great

 Disappointing

 A Great Story, Poorly Told

 Too much drama

 Should be shown at SciFi channel!

 Gratuitous blood and gore

 Cheesy movie with flaws in the scenario

 This movie should have been called Full Employment for Australian Actors

 Just cut the rope...

 Almost a so bad it's good.

 It Never Ends!!

 Hot Shots! realism

 Terrific story but very poor movie

 Well the combat scenes are good at least....

 Sharknado of War Films

 Ultra-violence, Shameless Copying

 Absolute Mel Gibson, Ruins Absolutely

 More dross than Doss

 Warning spoilers !!

 Hypocritical film
