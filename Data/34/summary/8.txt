 Great work

 Biography of a Repentant Nazi

 Excellent but curiously unmoving

 Woah !!! That was disturbing

 Life Transformation

 The power of education

 Brutal History X!

 A strong 8

 Disturbing and powerful

 Good enough to merit watching

 Great until the end

 Norton's acting delivers the sheer loss that racism can truly bring

 very emotional, very good

 what is the film trying to say??

 American History X

 Top Notch Film

 Powerful movie

 Amazing, upon first glance.

 Norton's best performance, but he flies solo in this one

 An excellent, and visual portrayal of consequences of racism.

 one of Nortons best movies

 Where no man has gone before.

 Very good lessons
