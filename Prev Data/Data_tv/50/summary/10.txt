 The series ended with Spacey's departure

 Pioneering Perfection

 An American Twist on a British Classic

 As good as the original

 Complete Captivation

 Best political drama since the West Wing

 Great, great, great

 a nauseating program about how sausage is made

 Season six doesn't suck

 The high rating is for 1-5. 6 is a disaster.

 House of Cards Review

 Best Show Not Actually on TV...A Modern Masterpiece

 A Must see

 Ridiculous User Ratings

 Satirical, Conniving, Savvy, Intellectual

 Fantastic!

 One of the most detail-orientated shows ever.

 An excellent political drama that shouldn't be missed.

 Love every season even more than the proceeding one

 Why watch A House of Cards (Hint: You already know it)

 Best political drama i've ever seen in my life

 In today's TV Landscape... H.O.C.'s is a very welcome GAME CHANGER!

 Unrealistic supremacy

 Time to face reality.

 And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
