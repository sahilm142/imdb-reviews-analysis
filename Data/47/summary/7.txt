 one of the best children's movies from my child hood

 Great

 Very good, But not Disney's best like everyone claims

 Would you believe its dated!

 A classic, but..

 Very good

 The Lion King is very good

 good movie

 No bad, but it could be a lot better.

 Its a Disney classic.

 Scar is such a great disney villain

 Fantastic Animation (with a capital "A").... Superb voices!

 One of the Great Disney Films of the Early 1990s

 From a person who generally does not enjoy a Disney musical this one was pretty good.

 Fairly Overrated (Especially compared to other movies)

 Strong and engaging animation film that has its issues and its messages but delivers on an entertaining level above all else.

 The end of an era...

 Lovable lions....

 One of the most important animated films ever

 to be, or not to be, that is the question?

 Pure Disney magic

 90's Bambi

 Just some thoughts on Scar (possible spoilers)

 I'm Supposed To Hate Disney Movies...

 "Slimy, yet satisfying."
