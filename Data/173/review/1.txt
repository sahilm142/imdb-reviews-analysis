*SPOILERS*First of all, let me warn you. I've always detested Tarantino, so I didnt'go see this film free of prejudice.That said, I can't think of a worse film I've seen lately, except "The Matrix Reloaded". The reason is that Tarantino shows too much violence, and that he doesn't show anything else. "But that's the point!" some will say. The point of what? Ok, lets' make a film and let's show a rape and say that that's the point. Does that mean that the film is good?Tarantino has always been overrated (I disliked "Pulp Fiction" as well). The reason is that he manages to feel unconventional and artsy, so many will feel smart by saying that he's a genius, that his films are masterpieces and all that crap. The plain truth is that he's either a sadistic voyeur or a cunning man who's found a way to make pots of money by exploiting people's naivety. Or both.Although I don't like gore or black humour, I sometimes appreciate it (eg some films with Vincent Price). The point is trivial, but worth making: black humour has to be, well, humorous. The problem with Tarantino is that he's nothing. A vacuum.Some reviewers have said that if you don't understand what this film is about, you just won't get it; that it's a mockery and so on. The problem is that if one treats himself to shallow, uninspired, unoriginal, uninventive films, who are shot chiefly for the purpose of using some glitzy special effects and for solvin someone's money problems for the rest of his life, you may find such a film creative or inspired, instead of just the trick it is.Tarantino is in quotations. He quotes all the time. But a film full of quotations and references is a trick that is worth doing once or twice. After that, it can't hide any more the outright lack of creativity that hides behind the references.If you watch a gory b-movie (or any b-movie, for that matter), you may like it, even love it, but you'd never go so far as to claim it's a work of "art". Tarantino is "hip" (for the time being), so it's fashionable to call this lame director a genius.But time will tell.Remember David Lynch.
Spoiler Alert!!! I like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The story line was strong in RD and less so in PF. PF, though, had interesting sub-plots that loosely wove together to make a good movie.I also see the genius in the dialog in RD and in the characters in Pulp Fiction. I was expecting to see something in this movie.Unfortunately, Kill Bill was not interesting, nor genius and did not have a plot. Basically, the main character was screwed over in a previous time in her life and made a top 5 hit-list of people from which to extract revenge.The way she extracts revenge is to engage in hand-to-hand or martial weapon on weapon combat. Of course, the protagonist wins the fights and the people are checked off the list.I think Luci Liu (sp?) is the 3rd person on the list. The movie goes into a 20 minute section on how she gets a Okinawan curved sword. Now armed with the best weapon, she takes on Liu's whole team of trained martial artists - and whips them all single handedly. I'm talking 20, 30, 40 individuals who all attack her at the same time in the same room. She still wins.Then, she battles the "board leader", and after sufficient scenery changes, she wins again.Each of these battles is full of graphic violence and blood, as you'd expect from the director (I won't try to spell his name). But, you can only show an arm getting lopped off and the resulting gieser of blood so many times. Wait, my mistake, you can show it for 2 hours if you are the movie Kill Bill.After the Liu's character is killed, #3 is checked off and the movie ends.There is no plot. The special effects and battle scenes were state of the art, but do not make a movie.I have no interest in "Part 2" because I have no interest in any of the characters or in more film about Uma killing people with swords. 2 hours was 1.5 hours too much.Two thumbs down. Don't believe the (if any) hype.
If Tarantino is a genius, then I was a genius at age twelve.  With dialog like `silly rabbit, trix are for kids,' I don't understand why people fawn over this juvenile imbecile.  His `homages' are just blatant rip offs of movies that we've already seen .  Some of which, are so dumb that only Tarantino could be impressed by them. Kill Bill is just an idiotic excuse for teenage mentality violence.  How dare they call this excellent film making.


                
I don't know what people like about this movie. Everyone told me to see it: the critics, my aunt and the kids I went with. However, I was in for a major surprise. The kids I was with didn't even enjoy the gratutious blood or the "really cool" ninja action. This type of movie (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon clone) is getting really old and I wish other moviegoers would start to agree. I really can't think of too much I liked about this movie other than one side character who was particularily interesting. However, she will not be enough reason to go to see part two (I have a feeling she'll make a comeback). Quentin Tarantino is just getting worse with every movie. As a 13 year old boy said tome as we walked out, "It's like they were trying to be funny, but it really wasn't funny. It was just stupid."
******Spoilers*****and a lot of them too****Since I am not a brainwashed cult follower of Quentin I was able to actually see the movie before rating it as the best thing ever made.
The first minutes were incredible, and I was having the time of my life. Opening scene in black and white bloodied Uma, then fade to black, melancholy music, fading out to perfection, suburbia (toys in yard, nice pretty house) then we have a funny as hell chick fight which is made all the better by a little kid that just stays there.. and says nothing. Basically the imagery is great and sets a mood. Then we have a flashback to the wedding, followed by a hospital scene giving some background of what just happened. And it ends. The moment you see black mamba telling her big toe to move while the camera repeats this a few times, you have a problem. The first thing you realize in the frames after we finally stop zooming on the toes, is that well, this is nothing more than a Charlie's Angels rip. Concept and idea. Ok there is still time for salvation right? Not really. Because then comes an anime scene that has no purpose at all, and unless you are an anime fan, it will simply suck. Lots of animated blood, still motion drawings and all other things we have seen in countless anime toons on cartoon network come to life. You can safely skip it, not like something valuable will occur. Which is the problem with this whole movie. It has no coherence. You can watch it at any point and not miss a thing. But it gets worse. Next on the murder list is the same girl we saw in the anime scene, and she is in Japan. So Black Mamba goes to Japan, and what follows for the other half of the movie is mindless kung fu that is bad, a lot of stupid time wasting moments of Japanese people speaking Japanese wise words, which are translated in annoying captions. Actually that would have been a nice touch, but they literally NEVER end. Japanese. Subtititles. More useless preaching. Wise men advice. Captions. Japanese. Captions. Repeat.
Although it is basically badly executed kung fu, even it suffers from some pretty obvious faults. Booze drinking schoolgirl uniform wearing underage female guard? Come on. And just to mention the tie wearing, sword swinging guards (samurai?) that just keep on coming. Please its a parody. A pathetic attempt to mix the infamous Japanese gangs of the 80s and 90s with ancient kung fu and traditions. At least that's the best I could make of it.
I am not going to guess what that movie was trying to be because it clearly had no point. It started great, it fell apart in about 2 minutes. Literally 2 minutes and that is even sadder. Save your time, watch the first thirty minutes, then go rent a real kung fu flick to fill in the rest.
Just goes to prove how moronic most present day movie-goers are. How anyone could give this a rating above 3 is totally beyond me. The movie is badly written and directed, end of story. The visuals are just a compendium of clichés stolen from countless other films. The plot is just any excuse for a bunch of over-the-top scenes of martial arts violence stolen from every bad 'B' martial arts film in existence. The only exception being the bad 'B' martial arts films are 50 times more entertaining than this overblown garbage-fest. And if I were Uma or Lucy or any of the other actors, I would be embarrassed to see my name on the credits. If you want to see a good film of this nature, see Peter Jackson's Dead Alive or Sam Raimi's Evil Dead. Those are at least fun, over-the-top violent films. The chances of my seeing part 2 after this are 0 to none. At least I didn't pay anything to see it, because that's what it was worth.
That there are so many sheep out there whose goodwill towards Tarantino extends towards giving this film anything other than a firm thumbs down. What a mess. A genuinely embarrassing effort with terrible characters, wooden performances and no plot to speak of all covered up with glossy production design and ludicrous fight sequences. Most critics agree it is his worst film by a country mile.I am prepared that the whole thing should be redeemed by Kill Bill 2. But this on its own, Kill Bill 1 is rated so highly on IMDb that it makes the Top 250 above films such as Butch Cassidy, Life of Brian, Annie Hall to name just three. That is because there are a lot of complete idiots out there. Hopefully this will go towards redressing the balance


                
So there is a lot of cult movie hype about how great Kill Bill is.....well, the first scene was just a shot of Uma Therman's incredibly beat up face which put a bad taste in my mouth. I gave it some time to get going, but all in all, this, even in its edited form, was such a violently grotesque movie, that I quickly decided it was not for me. I even had TiVo-ed Vol. 2 of the series, but if its anything like the first volume, I don't want anything to do with it. Sure there are plenty of violent movies, but this is just plain gross. So if you ask me, I wouldn't ever ever ever recommend it. I doubt there will be a cleaner version of it too, because it appears that the whole movie is going to be grossly violent. Who likes to look at Uma Therman, anyway? She freaks me out without portraying a white trash assassin in a movie.Of course I can see how this is very much a homage to the old-school 70's era martial arts movies, but I just cannot get past the blatant violence. I'm all for realism, but do I really need to know exactly what it is like to see hundreds of people killed all in different ways? The answer is no, thank you.
I'm a fan of QT and much admire his earlier films, but sorry sports fans, Kill Bill is a tedious piece of junk. That Tarantino planned at one point to release both "volumes" as one three-hour film is astonishing. After the first hundred severed limbs, I couldn't stop yawning. With its inexorable cartoon violence; the predictable BS posturing of virtually every major character; and the obvious trajectory of its threadbare plot, Bill is technically flawless, emotionally antiseptic, and dramatically dormant. Clearly, QT has spent himself.  To be fair, Reservoir Dogs was a masterpiece; Pulp Fiction, audacious and brilliant...tick tock tick tock... Then Jackie Brown, a nice adaptation, but hardly earth shaking.  And now comes Bill, which owes everything to cheesy, grade-C, 1970s Japanese fight-flicks.  Buckets of blood and meat-grinding mayhem do not of themselves make for scintillating cinema.  The trick that eludes Tarantino is how to keep the viewers' attention while he attempts a hybrid of Seven Samauri and the World Wrestling Federation.  The sensual aspects alone should have been enough to sustain interest, but no.  Ultimately, Bill becomes an exercise in fever-pitched tedium.  Perfecting the cinematic equivalent of crap is hardly an achievement, no matter how well-crafted the montages.


                
This could have been a great movie if Quentin Tarantino had not directed. He really has no idea how to film martial arts scenes. (The second volume, which contains very little fighting, is terrific).One reviewer on IMDb wrote that a good martial arts scene makes you wish it would keep going on. For instance, you could watch 3 hours of one continuous Jackie Chan fight scene and never get tired. I would add that another quality is that is stimulates the little, imaginative, childish nerve in all of us and makes us want to do martial arts. This movie had neither quality. The fight scenes were embarrassing--I was cringing, waiting for them to end. They looked ugly and absurd.There was, however, some kind of strange, perverse beauty in how quickly the Bride could kill. Had Q.T. focused on that, he could have compressed this into about 20 minutes, and combined both movies. There was no real plot, and the dialogue was horrendous, so compression could only help.Not only were the fight scenes choreographed badly, they were filmed badly as well. The battle with the crazy 88s: Too many people on the screen, poor camera work, and then Q.T. makes it even harder to see whats going on with stupid tricks, like going black and white.An English professor of mine gave me some wise advice, saying "A good artist knows what to leave out." Too many things should have been left out because they had no point, and did not move the plot. For instance, the Bride sitting on airplanes and people driving places filmed in what I suppose was meant to be an "artsy" way added 20+ minutes to the film. When an artist indulges himself and not his audience, he insults his audience.
Some people might like this! People who love watching arms & legs being cut and blood spread all over will love this... I really wonder how this movie is getting such high ratings.. Just because of producer & actress? I haven't seen a more serious trash in a very long time! I was so relieved when the movie finished! The first time in a long time I felt like asking for my money back.. Such a disgrace for filmmaking!I've read here some reviews saying that some people bash it because they do not understand it?! What is there to understand? And really how sick someone must be to enjoy a "bloody master piece" as you call it?


                
I caught Mr. Tarantino's latest piece at the Stockholm Film Festival and I was greatly disappointed, to put it mildly. This film is a piece of sh*t. There's just no two ways about it. It stinks.The characters are flatter than racoons on a highway, and the depth and development of the story is put to shame by most Italian operas. There is no trace of the intricate story building of Pulp Fiction, nor of the empathy for the characters sometimes found in Jackie Brown.All we get here is an endless orgy of über-cool nasty people in designer clothing cutting off feet on highly stylized stage sets, with fountaineous gushes of blood the high-point of the fun.The action scenes are tired, bleak copies only. They have already been done better in countless asian genre movies. Uma Thurman fights a large number of black-suited opponents at the same time? Well, wasn't that already done in Matrix II? It's not really funny the second time around, is it?There is no longer any originality in Tarantino's work. Everything is borrowed, everything is an hommage to something or other. But with no focus of its own, no vision to guide it along, the movie just disintegrates into a hodge-podge of stolen scenes and stolen ideas. Kill Bill just doesn't have a "soul". It is empty, void, a pointless excursion into excessive, stupid violence.With this movie, Tarantino has finally proven his critics right. Now, he really is just another panderer of speculative ultra violence.


                
The past several years have been amazing for the film industry. Amazing in that never before in the history of the craft have so many highly financed and talented houses produced such incredible pieces of garbage. The only thing worse than this film is the fact that people are supporting it.The creation and success of this gratuitous rubbish masquerading as film is hard and disappointing proof that our nation is being overtaken by the stupid. Welcome to generation-perpleXed!Q.T.: seek help. Also, please don't reproduce. Same goes for the fans of this film.Fans of real film: Instead of spending your money here, donate it to genetic research. Maybe DNA scientists can unlock the 'stupid' gene and create a treatment which could be administered to the suffering at the next Q.T. showing.
ZERO of 10! Avoid!


                
Gone is Tarantinos stylish dialogue. It's hard to believe the man that kept us entertained with a conversation about a cheeseburger is the same guy responsible for this.It's in desperate need of editing. There's so much that should have been cut, apart from the end fight the movie lacks pace and feels stretched. Talk about Miramax cashing in! :(Unfortunately unless you're in HK you will be watching a censored version which switches to B&W in the final fight as soon as the blood starts flowing. Thankfully fans should be able to pickup a R3 Uncut DVD.The only thing I did enjoy was the music, end fight (colour would have been nice!) and surprisingly (the part I was most sceptical about) the anime.
Save your money, its only half a movie and not a very good one at that.


                
I'm so glad that I didn't go to the cinema to see "Kill Bill". I mean, I should like Quentin Tarantino's films. I thought that "Reservoir Dogs" and "Jackie Brown" were superb and I sort of liked "Pulp Fiction". Tarantino hadn't done much for a while before "Kill Bill" so there was a high level of expectation before the film's release.What put me off the cinema release was the "Volume One" tag. I didn't want to pay to sit through a film that I wasn't going to like and that only took me halfway through the story. Now that the film has made it to TV in the UK, I'm disappointed to tell you that my suspicions were correct.Major problem: Kill Bill Filler - (1) The faux anime sequence that gives you the back story of Lucy Liu's character. Presumably the budget wouldn't stretch to having piece done by a real Japanese anime studio, so we get some American guy's version of what he thinks anime should look like. Wrong. Just to pile on the disappointment, it's predictable and pointless, a complete waste of screen time. (2) Tarantino also drags us back to the blood-drenched chapel too many times. OK, The Bride's been left for dead by a bunch of murderers, Quentin. We've got that. Can we move on please? (3) The Bride emerging from her coma, la la, drone drone, sexual perversion, violence, drag drag, shuffle shuffle, more violence, pimp my ride, drag drag, wiggle your toe, yawn, wake me up when it's over. I'm not sure how long all this filler guff goes on for but I knew that I'd been watching for ALMOST 2 HOURS OH GOD THE PAIN by the time the credits rolled.The action sequences are impressively staged but are too "stagey" to be exciting. In particular, the showdown with the Crazy 88 gang plays out like the climax of a TV Batman episode. The bride deals with wave upon wave of sword-wielding goons before reaching the "Boss Level" and despatching Lucy Liu's character in a couple of minutes. After watching a Japanese schoolgirl and the entire Tokyo Branch of the Reservoir Dogs Fan Club line up to get slaughtered, I was expecting something more interesting and involving. Tarantino's dialogue is well written and well observed, and he has a knack for creating fully-formed characters in short order. Unfortunately in "Kill Bill" he has eschewed the intelligent side of his film making skills in favour of crude splatter, pointless-endless violence and more cheap TV/film references than you can throw a katana at. This is what happens when you let a film geek loose with a big budget and carte-blanche. It's one of the few times that I've wished the Hollywood Suits had reined in a writer/director. "Kill Bill"? More like "Overkill, Bill". You'll have to look elsewhere to see a good example of Quentin Tarantino's talent.Finally, there's the issue of the supposedly Star Trek Klingon proverb used in the opening titles. (A) "Revenge is a dish which is best served cold" is used in "Star Trek II" by Khan, a genetically-engineered human renegade, not by a Klingon. (B) the phrase "La vengeance est un plat qui se mange froid" was originally coined by Pierre Ambroise Francois Choderios de LaClos in his classic novel, "Les Liasons Dangereuses". If you're going to use an over-quoted phrase, Quentin, at least acknowledge the correct author.
I am a real movie fan whose two favorite movies are "The Sand Pebbles" and "Flight of the Phoenix" (the 1965 original, not the pathetic recent remake with Dennis Quaid trying to better Jimmy Stewart). I was excited when a friend gave me Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2 on DVD for Christmas. Last night my SO and I watched Vol. 1. Or tried to. This is easily the most loathsome, gratuitously violent and sickening film I've ever tried, and the ONLY gift DVD I've shut off part way through.I don't know what compels anyone to make a film like this, nor makes otherwise intelligent people praise such a work. By the time we got to chapter 4 -- the animated segment in which a child watches her parents being slaughtered like animals by sadistic killers -- we had had it. By unanimous consent, we switched it off and put both DVDs in the trash.I can't truly express how horrid and disgusting is this film, devoid of any entertainment value except for the mentally ill. If you have not seen it, don't. If you have been given a DVD, pitch it. That this film has been honored says a lot about Hollywood, and none of what it says is flattering.Ugh!


                
I heard a lot of hype over the release of this movie.  The previews and commercials promised heavy kung-fu action in a charlies angels fashion. What I ended up with was a movie heavy on the vulgar language filled with short moments of violence for shock value only.  Other things that didn't sit too well were the cutting in an out of anime shorts.  Very annoying retro harmonica music and the fact that there will be more of these kill bill films coming.  I haven't seen such an over-hyped piece of garbage since Titanic.I'm sure this movie has its fan base but for hollywood to market it as a flashy chick martial arts flick is just wrong.


                
This is supposed to be one of the 100 best films ever (as presently in the IMDB poll)? I don't understand this - actually, I did not expect to ever watch such an awful movie in my life. So, why is it so bad? Because it leaves you completely cold. The story (if you want to call it story) is ridiculous. Yes, there are some surprises, beautifully arranged scenes and laughs, some original moments too. Tarantino obviously was in command of many tricks and means and links to other movies (as you expect), but to what end? I guess that any film is bad that does not show real characters. I guess "Kill Bill" is utterly inhuman - not due to its excessive violence (which is annoying nevertheless), but because it's not about human beings.
Surely, Tarantino had lots of fun when making this movie. Watch it if you like stupid mangas.


                
There are two things that stand out about this movie.  One is that it is the epitome of gratuitus violence and is only for those that want to sacrifice story for gory special effects. The second important point is that the movie was deliberately chopped in half in order to cash in on those drooling gore seekers that are too ignorant to realize they are being had.  I expected more substance from Tarantino than mindless violence.  Pulp fiction had lots of violence but it had it's place in that movie.  This film is pandering to the lowest common denominator.  Save your money.


                
Quentin Tarantino is the most over rated movie director ever. He basically makes the same film over and over again with a different title. Excessive violence, vile bad language and childish humor, but absolutely nothing else. What is Kill Bill? Is it suppose to be an action movie? Kung fu? Japanese sword movie? Parody? Spoof? Whatever it is suppose to be it fails at every level.Uma Thurman is awful and doesn't fit the part at all. Lucy Liu is the only stand out actress but I wish she hadn't made this silly movie as she is much better than that.Mr Tarantino really needs to grow up and the movie going public needs to stop falling for his silly movies.Or if you must watch his movies, just watch one because they are all the same anyway.


                
So many similarities between this QT movie and Sergio Leone's action films (once upon a time in the west; the good, the bad and the ugly). The storyline, the action, the soundtrack etc... There's nothing wrong in trying to imitate (or cover) a great classic, but what's wrong is the out-of-taste disgusting butchery and repulsive gore that prevails in this movie. It could have been as good (if not better) if the 'butchery' scenes have been made less explicit. For this reason I give Kill Bill a low rating.


                
Frequently boring, extremely disjointed, and way too self-congratulatory. My biggest personal pet peeve was that it was very noncinematic in its heavy use of  voiceover narration, on-screen titles, and speechifying by characters. I like film to convey points of plot and character and mood and attitude through imagery and action... that's what the medium excels at, no? To have these points conveyed through narration and bad dialogue is inexcusable to me. As for the vaunted action sequences... yes, they are well done, but I found myself wanting to go home and watch all of a Leone western, or a early-70's Japanese pop-Samurai film, or "Battle Royale," or one of my favorite HK action flicks, rather than Tarantino's far-too-short pastiches of same. I so desperately want this film to bomb at the box office. If this travesty spawns imitators, I'm packing it in and bidding farewell to multiplex cinema. On a positive note, Uma was enjoyable in the lead and Lucy Liu made a fine villainess. It was great to see Sonny Chiba on the big screen, also.


                
Kill Bill is an extremely pointless movie.  Bad acting, bad editing, poor character development, some fight scenes were OK but nothing compared to Zatoichi films, old Jet Li films or even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's empty, it's hollow and it's much worse than Jackie Brown.  The stylised violence is so ridiculous that the audience laughs at it.  What is this world coming to when people laugh when someone's head gets cut off? What is the point of all the violence anyway?  This movie is a sociopathic juvenile fantasy and there is no way that it came from the heart of an artist. I've heard several comments about how Kill Bill is an homage to kung fu and anime movies, and this may have been QT's intent. Unfortunately for him, it comes across as stereotyping and an insult to kung fu movies at best, and appropriation of voice and prejudicial at worse. Yes, Tarantino can put together a great soundtrack and a slick, stylized pa ckage, but this movie has zero substance.  If Kill Bill is the emperor, then he has no clothes, he is up there on the screen buck naked and boy is he ugly.  Don't believe the hype. And does anyone else get the feeling that vol 1 and 2 are just one movie cut in half so we can pay twice to see it?


                
Calvin: Isn't it strange that evolution would give us a sense of humor? It's weird that we have a physiological response to absurdity. We laugh at nonsense.Hobbes, walking away: I suppose if we couldn't laugh at things that don't make sense, we couldn't react to a lot of life.Calvin, now alone: I can't tell if that's funny or really scary.*There will be spoilers in here* Many audience members at the sneak preview screening of "Kill Bill vol.1" felt compelled to laugh a the absurd senselessness of this film. The movie seems to play as a spoof and I wished it was at times so that I could laugh along with the grotesque display of constant dismemberments, beheadings and occasional disembowelments I was watching.  However there is little comical about this film.  It decides to focus on things such as raping women in comas, a pre-teen girl killing a man while she's having sex with him, a little girl being dowsed in her mother's blood (and another little girl watching her mother die in a knife fight) as well as the good old 'sword chopping off the top of a head to expose brain' shot.  At least Tarantino didn't use the slowly falling apart body/head cliché.  A memorable laugh getter from the audience is from a women writhing in pain on the floor after her arm is severed.  She is seen in the background of numerous shots in a pool of her blood, much like Mr. Orange in `Reservoir Dogs'.  Nobody laughs at Mr. Orange's predicament because you feel for the character and the situation he's in, however the woman in `Kill Bill' got an awkward chuckle from the audience do to the nonsense that was being experienced.The movie is chocked full of horrific images that have no purpose but to move the numbingly simplistic plot towards the next gory visual explosion. And all without the witty dialogue that Tarantino's other films have possessed.I won't be recommending this film to anyone, and neither are the other five people I went to see it with.
Before you can fairly review 'Kill Bill' please watch some true Asian cinema first. Such as: The Killer, Hard Boiled, Bullet in the Head, Shogun Asassin, Lone Wolf series, Ninja Scroll, Fist of the North Star, Crying Freeman, Blood, Invincible Shaolin, Master Killer, Legend of the Wolf, Five Deadly Venoms, Battle Royale and I don't recommend it, but the Guinea Pig series. Then, honestly see if you don't say Kill Bill is simply a poor copy of truly gritty cinema. Hell, QT even got Woo Ping, probably the best stunt choreographer of all time, thats why the fight scenes are so good, in essence he copied everything from the best of Asian cinema, except a good story. Liking Kill Bill is like liking frozen pizza, then one day going to Italy and tasting the real deal, big difference. I have seen all the movies I mentioned, and each surpasses Kill Bill in violence, story, choreography, or all three, people are heaping undue praise on QT. Real creativity is watching 'Hidden Fortress' then making 'Star Wars', but that was in a galaxy far,far, away. Hollywood nowadays is "the asians have a movie called Ringu, I hear its scary" "well let's copy it for America" "Ringu 2?" "copy that too!" "Ju-on" "copy!!", and the zombie moviegoers are none the wiser. Want to see an AMAZING movie? City Of God, its what QT wished he could have made. Some reviewers need to expand their viewing habits, there's a world of good movies out there. And if you can't read subtitles, there's always night school.
