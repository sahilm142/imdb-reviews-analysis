 There's no reason to watch without Kevin Spacey.

 Unhinged

 The worst season one could only imagine

 3rd season is a big failure

 Stop fooling us

 What a bore it became

 Good Acting Bad Script

 Three Star Rating for Season 6 Only

 Season 6

 I wanted to believe... (No, really!)

 5 Seasons would rank at a 9. Season 6 should never have been.

 Really Want to Like This, but I am shocked it is so popular upon Viewing.

 3 Stars just because first season was great.

 I feel cheated

 Should have got rid of it

 "house of sissies"

 This is one of the most overrated shows ever.

 gradual weakness on story

 Not as good as the 5 other Seasons

 Very good show but very bad at the same time

 Silliness

 not as good as the original English series

 Bloated, glacial pacing, one note

 Diminishing returns

 Changed my mind
