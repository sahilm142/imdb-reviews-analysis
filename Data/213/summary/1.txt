 Riddled with plot holes that ruined the experience

 Terrible

 Do not watch

 Crap with a Capital K!

 How is this movie so highly rated?

 Just awful, does not deserve any of the praise.

 Not worthy of all the praise

 Why the dark and sad episode?

 Yet another empty, depressing failure of an X-Men movie

 Your heroes are NOT invincible

 So bad..

 I can't believe how bad was the movie

 spare yourself the pain and don't watch this

 Worst movie ever

 Slash Everyone In Sight And Get This Over With

 Logan is a BIG down-step of X-men franchise

 Terminaverine

 Dumb and dumber,raises a dysfunctional half mute kid

 lame sell out

 Child Abuse

 An all out sh*t movie!

 Violent, Exploitative, Stupid

 Heartbreaking

 Good acting and potential that is wasted

 Logan goes Bogan
