 If you only see one film this century...

 An Artistic Masterpiece & Also A Joy To Watch

 A movie of redemption.

 Sublime, beautiful silent romance

 Cinematic Magic Realism

 A work of art about the permanence of love and the temporary nature of lust...

 Perfection

 An Absolute Masterpiece

 A gem of the silent era

 One of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen - and it's 80+ years old!

 Sunrise is that rare thing, a film that is equally technically and emotionally astonishing, with neither of those elements detracting from one another

 Silent Symphony

 Stays with you forever

 A powerful love story

 It made me cry...which is very rare

 As gorgeous as they say

 Absolute Apex of Silent film and The One to see before you die

 Glad to know this flick is SO well loved!

 The Farmer Takes His Wife

 No Finer Film Sound or Silent

 One of the greatest and original films in movie history.

 Such a simple and beautiful masterpiece.

 Greatest movie ever made?

 One of the most powerful films ever.
