 A movie that embraces the worst in humanity

 The greatest trick Kevin Spacey ever pulled...

 The zenith of self-consciously pseudo-profound inanity!

 Everything that's wrong with Hollywood, distilled into two horrible hours. Spoilers.

 Look closer...oops! Too close!

 Hollywood PC pandering and propaganda

 American Beauty isn't

 Pretentious and senseless

 Ridiculous

 Extremely Disappointing

 This is the most over-rated film i have ever seen

 What Is Up With This Film?

 I can't imagine a more trite film.

 Empty filmmaking

 Over-rated rubbish

 It's time to start over.

 American Stereotypes

 This film is a fraud...

 Extremely poor excuse for a movie not to mention a waste of good money.

 Hollywood's contemptuous view of "Flyover Country"

 One of the most over rated movies ever.

 Pretentious film that `borrows' from "The Ice Storm"......

 Look closer...and see how you've been duped

 sexist and unrealistic

 Possibly the most overrated movie of all time
