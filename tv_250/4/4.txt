Looking more like Trials of Life on steroids, this well-photographed look at Earth is replete with beautiful imagery, startling vistas, unusual close-ups and oddles of animal death. I didn't buy Trials of Life for that very reason, who wants to see a killer whale torturing a seal for 10 minutes, or as in this production, see wolves hunt prey, polar bears die in an effort to stave off starving by being punctured in a nest of Walrus, or birds swooping down to kill other birds, or worst of all, a group of orphan penguin babies slowly freezing to death, eyes of ice, dying before our eyes. This is not entertainment people, this is badly produced documentary posing as entertainment.Sigourney Weaver has a marvelous acting voice, but several hours of Ripleyesque monotone isn't pleasant. She was not the best choice for a narrator (too bad Richard Kiley wasn't still alive).And lastly, how many times does the phrase "for the first time" have to crop up in the narration? Once, twice? How about 5 or 6 times an episode, not to mention the bad editing and preachy environmentalist closing each episode has.Don't get me wrong. I love the animal imagery, like the weird birds in the rain forest, or the polar bear babies, or the penguin babies, or the oryx battles, but they should leave the death scenes on the cutting room floor. Yes, I know there is both life and death, but in this case, death spoils the appeal of the show.
