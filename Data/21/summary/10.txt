 Stunning - in every sense of the word

 "One of the best films you'll ever see!"--Roger Ebert, does it live up to the hype?

 Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling

 Cidade De Deus

 One of the best unseen foreign films

 City of God was Incredible

 an exillerating ride through the life of gangsters

 From the first moment to the last this movie is enthralling!

 The Other (Sad) Side of the Wonderful City of Rio de Janeiro

 Of how a chicken escaped alive

 A Mindblowing Masterpiece!

 The Best Film Ever Made

 The Three-Body Problem

 Easily my favourite movie of all time!

 Just... fantastic.

 Visceral and Fabulous

 a mixture of brilliance and utter disturbance

 A Moving, Powerful, and Compelling Story

 It leaves the judgments to the viewer

 The best Brazilian movie ever made !

 Great!

 Exceptional

 Filmmaking at its FINEST

 A movie that was born classic

 Amazing, Take-Your-Breath-Away Work of Art!
