 awful

 Bored to death

 10 minutes of story .. 50 minutes of brooding slow motion.

 What a load of rubbish

 Poor man's Boardwalk Empire

 Music KO'd me

 A dull, slow story wrapped in many layers of cosplay

 HORRIBLE

 How is it possible for a seemingly big budget series to be so ignorant ?

 season4 epic fail!!!!

 Not well informed
