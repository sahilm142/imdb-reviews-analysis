One-punch man starts with an intriguing twist on the shounen genre of anime in the first episode but after that it does nothing with it. The main joke of the show is repeated over the entire show while only being funny the first 2-3 times. The main character Saitama has no likable or distinct characteristics apart from the fact that he is simple (in the head) and bald. The animation is fantastic which really shows in the fight scenes. Most of the musical tracks aren't very impressive except its opening theme titled The Hero. In my opinion the shown best asset is its varied and creative in both design and personalities side characters which saved this show from me giving it a 3 star rating too bad the show never does anything decent with them apart from put them in "cool fights". This is a gag series based around a huge joke (which explains the stereotypical universe) and should be viewed as such but from a story perspective it does not hold up in any way as it has no story,continuity,character development,advancement of the non-existent plot or personality in any of the characters beyond what you see on the surface.


                
The concept is clever, but the execution is very poor. ~80% of the show feels like filler, and too much time is spent on uninteresting and unentertaining characters. Lots of loose ends after the show ends, too. There were some funny highlights, and I can see why people would like the show, but ultimately, shows like Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto and The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. do a much better job at keeping it fresh and fun. I feel like a lot of potential went to waste here.
