I gave the first episode a pass, premiers can be tough to judge as they set up the premise and characters. I was looking forward to this week's episode to see if they built on the momentum, or if it was going to bog down in a mire of formulaic cop show drivel. Sadly, it has. The writing is stagnant, and the acting forced. I found the detective pair, have they even said their names, lackluster and at times painful to watch. The young mom in the April 16 episode gave one of the worst acting performances I've seen on TV in a long while.The pacing of the show, at times, grinds to a halt. Swicthing between the story lines, at times for only a quick moment, causes the show to be quite fractured and hard to follow. I found myself often zoning out as the show just sludged its way through the hour.The interaction between Sherman (The Rookie) and Cooper (The training officer) should have been the main focus of the show. This is where Southland shines, but alas, it's only a sliver of what we get each week.The energy of Southland needs to ramp up exponentially or I for one will be finding something else to watch at 10pm on Thursdays.


                
There is just entirely too much going on in this film. While it may be an accurate representation of what police have to face on a daily basis, the audience is given far too many situations to comprehend.We're faced with a rookie cop paired with a veteran, drug dealing, shootings, a kidnapping of a young girl, more shootings, etc. It's just too much to endure.Regina King has come a long way. She is now a lady cop, but I question her fitness for the role. She still looked like she could pass for a high school student, old enough to be in a fight and yelling getting off of me!
