***SPOILERS HEREIN***American History X is a film filled with clichés and melodrama.  I am astounded that it is considered by IMDb users to be among the top 250 films ever made, let alone the top 100.Edward Norton's performance was good, considering the material, and Edward Furlong is also a decent actor.  However, the other performances here were third rate and totally over the top.   Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney acted as though he were performing in a community theatre production of Shakespeare.  Totally unbelievable.Speaking of unbelievability, how about, for starters, the incredibly lame scene wherein the movie's title is used as a line of dialogue?  So stilted and corny I almost turned the movie off right then and there.  (After seeing the end, I wish I had, but hindsight is always 20/20...)Let's move on then, to the absolutely asinine basketball game.  What the hell was this, West Side Story?  I expected at any moment that they were going to start singing and dancing, doing the splits in an effort to get each other off their turf. I mean, come ONNNNN.  Then, when the white boys won, the black guys said, "Oh, gee whiz!" and turned around and left, never to return?  PLEASE!  I didn't buy it for a second, and I can't believe anyone else did.On to my next grievance.  Norton's co-worker in the prison laundry was sent to prison for six years because he dropped a television on a cop's foot and it was considered assault.  He says he was caught because the store that he stole the TV from was right next to a donut shop filled with cops.  This movie supposedly tries to teach the viewer a lesson about how wrong it is to stereotype, but the whole thing is full of nothing BUT stereotypes.Most annoying in my opinion, however, was the score.  The music constantly drowned out the dialogue (which, considering the writing, was probably a blessing). I abhor films that insult my intelligence by continuously attempting to manipulate my emotions with music.  If you want me to be moved by your film, cut out the sappy music, and give me good directing, good performances, and a believable story.  Don't try making me feel moved by music that's ten times louder than the dialogue because you can't make a decent film.The ultimate insult in this film is the ending.  Absolutely beyond ridiculous.  Totally beyond moronic.  The kid that Edward Furlong blew cigarette smoke at is now going to shoot him in the face in the school bathroom?  Is he mentally retarded? Why not just shoot him in the middle of a police station, perhaps one full of white guys and black guys making angry faces at each other while fat cops sit around eating donuts?  At least a stealthy drive-by shooting would have been more realistic, if blowing smoke in someone's face is really an offense worthy of death.  Additionally, what was up with there being no paramedics in the bathroom when a child had just been shot? They are just going to leave him there with his head in the urinal??? PLEASE!!!!Overall, this is an awful, awful, AWFUL movie.  Predictable, trite, with the most offensively contrived ending I have seen in quite some time.  I knew what was going to happen, and was appalled when it did.  Not because it shocked me or made me think, but because I couldn't believe the filmmakers thought I was really stupid enough to buy it.What a piece of trash.  * out of *****.  Norton's acting couldn't come close to saving this steaming pile.
Making a movie about racism is a very easy way to tap into an audiences pre-existing righteous anger without the need to really explore the subject, treat it with respect or develop any kind of understanding around it. AHX knows this, so advances a paper thin plot with any number of ludicrous clichés, cardboard characters and dopy narrative devices. Edward Norton is no longer the Universes least convincing skinhead (stand up, Elijah Wood), but this movie stretches credibility way past breaking point.The movie doesn't actually try to analyse racism on the more subtle, insidious way in which it exists in most peoples lives. Sure, there are neo-nazi and black power groups around, but this isn't most people's experience of racist behaviour. Only at the end of the movie do we get any hint this, when we see Dereks father discussing his pejudices over the dinner table. But this is very fleeting and it doesn't really give adequate justification for why Derek decided to go down this road in the first place. The movie should have spent far more time looking responsibly at the root causes of such peoples actions and ideologies - but that isn't as easy or as sensationalist as portraying all racists as maniacal cult-heads or separationists. The presence of characters like Stacy Keach's Manson-esquire demagogue serves the questionable purpose of allowing audience members to distance themselves entirely from these kinds of beleifs. Most people I think struggle to some degree with inherited prejudices as a result of ethnicity, class, geography, economic status etc, but films like this pander to our solipsistic view of ourselves as utterly non-judgemental by suggesting that racism only occurs amongst the lunatic fringe.Additionally Tony Kaye more or less disowned the finished product, claiming that Edward Norton used his star clout to have the film re-edited so that it was more to his liking. The main point of contention seems to have been that Kaye felt the film should have had 'an adequate black voice'. I'm not quite sure what was exactly meant by 'adequate', but I can totally agree that the films narrow scope shifts sympathy onto the white protagonists in a confusing and dubious way. Because almost all of the black characters are so unlikeable, aggressive and one dimensional, with no context to explain their actions, and because one of them ends the film by murdering Furlongs character (a child) for pretty much no discernible reason, it's hard not to feel like we are expected to empathise with Derek and possibly feel like his original agenda was justified. AS well as this, when a 'liberal' character like Murray is portrayed as an ineffectual, idealistic fool, you begin to wonder why the film is so intent on making a violent, near-psychopathic skinhead into some kind of marginalised voice of reason.Films that attempt to tackle the race issue in modern society will always fail to deliver as long as they are content to sit back and simply push buttons in order to generate a calculated response. The overwhelming majority of people in society know racism is a bad thing, but most ignore how endemic it is. Pinning it all on some gun totin' extremist hooligans, then not even being able to properly decide who you are sympathising with is not the mark of accomplished, mature filmmaking.
I found it hard to enjoy this film due to the overuse of tacky advertising techniques like slow motion (that were too slow), black and white for the flashbacks and general obvious editing and camera work - like when he has been raped in the shower and is lying on the floor. We see a close up of his Nazi Swastika (as if to hammer home the obvious point). This film tries to be poetic but doesn't succeed. After leaving the cinema, I had forgotten everything. This film doesn't even get close to a film such as The Haine, which had a much stronger build up of characters and story, and leaves a significant impact on the viewer, who can identify with the characters. They seem real. In American History X even the characters seem like cliches picked out from other films.
Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It reeks from start to finish, which is all the more painful because it was supposed to be good. Edward Norton sounds and looks more like the president of the Yale Republican Club than a white supremacist skinhead - the movies truly fatal flaw considering he's the linchpin of the whole thing. Elliot Gould as a woolly, ineffectual liberal is a stereotype, one of many in the cast.More troubling than the acting, though, is the direction, which could charitably be called confused. How else to explain why we end up rooting for the skinheads to beat the black guys in a basketball game to determine who will stay off the public courts of Venice for good. How else to explain that the skinheads actually win? On the Venice courts, where the level of play is so high that Ron Shelton actually set his own movie there ("White Men Can't Jump")? This scene is symbolic of how completely out of touch this movie is, how it ignores basic realities to construct its own while purporting to tell the truth, and how confused its storytelling and direction are. If racism is so bad, why are the majority of the black characters so unlikable, and why do the white supremacist characters seem so much more sympathetic and their actions so much more understandable? These concerns would be mere quibbles if the movie didn't claim to be so much more than it actually is. It fails to convey its message, and it fails artistically. Everything about it just sucks.


                
American History X tries teach us all a lesson about racism.  However, what it really teaches us is no matter how much talent you have (Edward Norton and Tony Kaye), you can still make an awful and pretentious movie.  The movie pulls off the tremendous feat of preaching more than a Baptist sermon, while simultaneously boring you to tears.  Tony Kaye was right to try to take his name off of it.


                
A few minor disconnects in the plot? Where are the connects? Everybody's just responding to the volatility of the subject and to Ed Norton's charisma. The rest of this patched-together nonsense is about as meaningful as a 93-minute Nike ad. That director has no idea what he's doing, and won't be heard from again, except as a neurotic nuisance. Talk about the emperor's new clothes! If everyone's so hot on "powerful", see "Slam" and discuss that one for a change.


                
I'm a bit bewildered by the praise heaped upon this film. Ed Norton does a good job and was just coming into his own at this point. His acting was not at the level it is today though. Furlong earned his money but did not shine in his role. Balk utterly failed to rise on this cinematic occasion and Keach showed up for the check. The story, the underlying message and personal transformation of Norton's character should be considered the pillars of this film. I however staunchly disagree with its position at number 61 in the top 250 films. Ponder for a moment that Spartacus is over 100 films below American History X, that alone should give you pause. It would be accurate to say that votes from the younger, more internet savvy, could be held accountable for such an imbalance. Those who felt that Eminem deserved an Oscar for 8 Mile. In both instances the story had a degree of truth and realism but Oscars are for a chosen few. I urge generation x and generation next to take more than a mere cursory look at the fellow top 250. Did Norton deliver the role with the same intensity as Brando? "Contemplate this on the tree of woe." James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom Conan the Barbarian (1982)


                
For it's appeal this movie relied entirely on dramatics based on pseudo racial tensions -- just like you see in almost all everyday boring media -- and the dramatics take on the same worn out theme of white supremacy aimed at the underprivileged black. Of course classism and other infinitely weightier issues are ignored in this type of black-and-white scenario. This issue is so overdone and so inaccurate that movies portraying it are at once passe and dangerously erroneous from a social standpoint.If you like drama that rams its theme home by beating you over the head with theatrics, and if you are uneducated enough to believe that simple discrimination results from something as superficial as skin color, then you will probably like this movie and even think it's profound. If you appreciate the subtle beauty in life and understand how nearly all issues have depth beyond their specious veneer, this movie will just be another tired rendition added to the multitude of preceding ones that pivot from the same worn and ridiculous theme -- racism.


                
****Spoilers*****AHX begins and ends with violence committed by the African-Americans against the white people, mainly the neo-nazis of the film. IMO this creates a kind of frame for this film that got me thinking about another film with similar narrative and semantic problems. The D.W. Griffith film The Birth of Nation, aka. The Klansmen came to my mind and back when that film was made there really was racism around, and guess what, there still is. Everyone remembers the glorious battle scenes of Griffiths' film but how many remember the horribly racistic depiction of african american slaves portrayed in that film.To me AHX suffers from the same symptom, trying to tell an epic story of some type but ultimately succumbing to racism because they simply hadn't done enough thinking about the subject matter that they had chosen. I really despise people who take everything that comes out of Hollywood as some kind of gospel that has to be studied and deified, IMO if it smacks of racism it's good to keep a distance to it. This film fails to say anything substancial about racism, it only succeeds in introducing the subject but it is as if the audience is being left waiting for a sequel, not because the original was so good but because the original failed to tell a good and complete story. And believe me, I have personally witnessed enough racism to know that one can easily make a really gripping and thoughtful film about racism, even without resorting to shock-tactics such as this film does.
This film reminds me of that tv-series Oz that tries so very hard to be 'topical' and 'philosophical' and 'gritty and in-your-face realistic' but fails to do any of them. Both, Oz and this film, only succeed in being a kind of soap opera that caters to the sick minds of the ones with an appetite for violence. Violence does not a story make.
One of the worst films I've ever seen.There is just one degree, the first. It's a postal card, without thoughts, without vision, and full of clichés !!!


                
It's rare that I turn down an opportunity to see a film for free.  It's even more rare that I regret having done so.  American History X was so strikingly bad though that I'm considering an attempt to sue for my wasted time. :-)The Plot:  Give the audience some credit!  American History X was painfully heavy-handed.  The word, "Duh," sprang to mind (and often mouth) every few seconds.  Challenge us...make us thing...leave some loose ends.  Ed Furlong's 18-hour redemption plan?  Please!The Cinematography:  I don't know who's to blame; my guess is Tony Kaye. How could something smack of pretension and look like an MTV show?  Cut, pan, cut, pan, slow-mo, black-and-white.  The camera work is symbolic of the film.  Kaye never visually engages the characters and perhaps that's part of the reason that AHX is so ineffectual.Ed Norton did what he could with a weak script and a poor director. Unfortunately, the most impressive thing about the movie was the way Norton changed his body for the role.  Tony Kaye (understandly) tried to remove his name from this "opus" and claimed that Norton was responsible for the editing.  If that's true, let's hope Ed Norton sticks to acting and Tony Kaye goes back to music videos.


                
As a Jew, I must say this production is seemingly straight out of the Frankfurt School of thought and should be revealed as the subversive Jewish Agitprop X that it is. Sadly, this film has shortcomings that range from the acting, to the direction, and even the post editing. But most importantly, the film utterly fails in its attempt to escape the infantile, pedestrian stereotypes that mire the picture in a laughably obvious attempt to drive an anti-white political narrative, not make an entertaining movie with any integrity whatsoever. This film goes out of its way to make the "groundbreaking" assertion that neo Nazis are misguided. Thanks, Hollywood Jews; I was wondering about that! But it makes no attempt to honestly investigate the legitimate (yes, legitimate) reasons behind white pride movements in general and uses epithetic, out-of-place "dialogue" to tacitly delegitimize a father's attempts to explain to his son what is justifiably wrong with liberal fascists trying to issue reparations for past injustices. The more prominent motifs in this film are clearly disturbing: 1. Blacks have no autonomy or agency and thusly cannot be held accountable for their overtly disproportional criminality. "They are merely products of social injustice and poverty." Real racism in action, my goy friends. 2. Black racism against whites should be accepted while only white racism, which we are led to believe is rampant "just under the surface", should be detested. 3. Whites should feel guilty for transgressions they did not personally commit because after all...white privilege, institutional racism, microaggressions, and other incredibly nebulous "sociological contrivances." 4. While all non-Caucasian groups that celebrate a racial identity are to be exalted, any pride among people of European descent is to be viewed with moral pessimism, abhorrent disgust and outright social rejection without the benefit of a civil discussion. I'm not technically "white"; but I can appreciate the innumerable gifts Caucasians have given the world. It's too bad so many of my fellow Jews in the movie industry take every opportunity to slander the descendants (especially males) of a group who produced a country that provides blacks the most hospitable environment to make something of themselves...or be their own worst enemy. That's freedom and I love the right not only to succeed, but also to fail. Failures make us who we are- for better or worse. This film hopefully makes someone better as it failed both technically and morally.


                
American History X is a very contrived and unrealistic soapbox movie against racism. The purpose of the movie is simple: beat viewers over the head with a simplistic message that they all already agree with in the first place! Namely, "Racism is bad!" Everyone already knows racism is bad, so a movie comprised of 2 hours worth of strung-together ridiculous contrivances that exists solely for the purpose to push the message "Racism is bad" is not exactly a work of art. Nor is it food for thought. This movie won't tell anyone anything that they don't *already know*, therefore the existence of the movie is pointless.Edward Norton plays a hardcore Nazi skinhead. He *looks* the part, but as soon as he opens his mouth, any chance of him being believable in that role is utterly destroyed. Edward Norton talks like - and has the demeanour of - a computer geek. There is no way to reasonably be immersed in believing he is a hardcore Nazi skinhead. For this reason I'm going to have to say Edward Norton gives a terrible performance in this movie. *Good* actors can change their voice, demeanour, and the aura they give off. Edward Norton cannot. He uses the exact same voice, and has the exact same wimpy computer geek demeanour/aura in American History X as he does in every single movie role he ever does. It bewilders me why such a bad actor - with no range whatsoever - is so popular. It actually makes this movie be *unintentionally hilarious* to see such a buffed guy be so incredibly wimpy and non-threatening.Edward Furlong plays his little brother. Furlong gives a good performance as always, however, he isn't given anything to work with. All his lines are very generic and bland.Avery Brooks gives an okay performance as the school principal, but there is nothing special about it. He's exactly the same in this movie as he is as Sisko in Deep Space Nine, or the gangster in the movie The Big Hit. Actually it seems Avery Brooks has actually *dialed down* his intensity in American History X; an intensity he has in all those other roles but *not* in American History X. So I must conclude that Brooks' performance in American History X is worse than usual.Edward Norton is supposed to be playing an extremely smart individual, yet his actions in this movie are anything but. He foolishly sets up a chain of events where if he had any intelligence at all, he would have foreseen that that chain of events would be sure to lead to his rape in prison. He also would easily have avoided prison in the first place if he had any intelligence. He also would have been able to prevent the bad ending his brother receives if he had any intelligence. Yet he sticks around the neighborhood like a moron at the end of the movie, which is what allows for his brother to be murdered.The ending of the movie is ridiculous, and actually ends up *reinforcing* the (incorrect) idea that Norton's character's original beliefs in this movie are accurate. The movie exists to say "Racism is bad!" in big flashing NEON letters. However, the ending of this movie (perhaps inadvertently) completely destroys this message by implying that Norton's character was right to be a Nazi skinhead. The ending of the movie has a Black guy murdering Furlong's character for no reason. Furlong blew smoke in his face earlier in the movie, but that is not a reason to shoot someone dead over (maybe a beat down at the very most). It is not something someone would do in real life. Yet this movie (perhaps racistly) has a Black kid killing a White kid for no reason whatsoever, which lends (tragically!) undeserved credibility to idea that the Nazi beliefs are correct and Norton's character was wrong to abandon them. This movie can't even get it's own very basic message right.0/10.
What an irritatingly simplistic and utterly unbelievable film this was. From the first to the last scene I was just amazed at how unnatural the scenario unfolded and how jaw-droppingly convenient every plot turn was laid out the viewer to mercifully accept. I just don't understand what people find entertaining about this sort of movie. The social commentary was laughable and at best lacking, the score obnoxiously present and far too much actors overacted to the point of it being a parody.All it takes is one preachy racist lecture from dad at the breakfast table to make a seemingly intelligent young man a skinhead...what? Even the average daytime soap creates a better backdrop than this. Blacks simply giving up their turf over a lost game of hoops? On what true story on what planet was this movie based again? *Ugh*This movie could have been made by Ikea; during construction everything is completely spelled out for you, but that which should be holding it together is randomly missing.3.5 / 10


                
Ed Norton in the lead role is more wooden than ever. He's meant to be portraying an evil skin head, and does so with his usual monotone voice and terrible acting skills, then we see Ed reformed, and he still has that monotone mahogany effect.This came out many years after higher learning and it just wasn't anywhere near touching that. Just a horrible film, terrible, and surprise surprise the miscreants of IMDb have voted it all the way into the top 100....ugh.It irritates me when people say this is a realistic film, it's far from it, in fact I found it very very Hollywood, and just awful.


                
This film had been highly recommended to me as a 'must-see' by a friend of mine as it was apparently so thought-provoking and powerful.The only thing that this film provoked in me was anger and disappointment - not with the subject matter, but with the film makers, and this type of film in general.If this film had been put before us in a realistic and more balanced, politically-unbiased way, then it would have perhaps got its message across much more effectively.In terms of realism - virtually every character in the film is a ridiculous stereotype. The funniest example of non-realism has to be the black v white basketball match could not have been depicted any less realistically if they had tried.The scene: A group of skinheads (who as far as we know have never played the game before) challenge the blacks (who seem to spend the majority of their lives playing the game) to a gentlemanly basketball challenge, whereby whoever loses has to immediately vacate the premises and never come back. Of course the skinheads narrowly win, and the losers politely vacate the area without so much as an "M.F." being uttered.Yeah right...The overall impression I got from this film was that it was just another crude anti-white, anti-democratic, socialist rant-fest along the lines of other similar films (Romper Stomper etc), and the message it puts across is this: If you are a white man who prefers the company of his own kind and dislikes black people, then you are a brainwashed, monumentally unintelligent loser who is incapable of reasoning or making any judgements for yourself. You idolise an insane 1930's Austrian dictator and there is a high probability that you are a homosexual rapist.If you are a black man who prefers the company of his own kind and dislikes white people, then that is totally acceptable and cool. If you want to be obnoxious and confrontational to the white folks, and go around shooting them through the head for no good reason, that is understandable because they are all probably horrid racists and deserve it.This film should be burned along with the small-minded chumps that made it.


                
American History X has a good message. Hate and racism is very bad. Unfortunately, so is the movie. I can't believe that this movie is considered such a masterpiece. I'm not even sure if this movie is serious or not. Is it a piece of liberal propaganda, or is it a satirical comedy made by a conservative who wanted to show us how many liberals see the world? Most likely it's propaganda...but sometimes it's hard to tell.Because most of the time, it's not even about real racism. Except for some hateful comments, most of what Derek (and his father) says during the dinner table scenes isn't shocking at all. A black person could have said the exact same thing. The filmmakers took valid political positions and added a small pinch of Adolf.According to American History X, you're racist if you're against affirmative action. The movie also seems to say that black people are animals. They're not responsible for their own actions. They commit acts like rioting and looting because they're scared of white people or angry because of the oppression. The movie is mostly remembered for two things: the gay prison scene and the curb stomping. Everyone is talking about those two scenes when they bring up the movie. I almost think the filmmakers did it on purpose, they added shocking stuff so that people would talk about it. I remember that all the "cool" kids bragged about having seen the part where the nazi is violated in the shower.There's also a completely pointless sex scene right before the curb stomping. I wonder why the director thought that was a good idea. But then I remember all of the other bizarre stuff in the movie. Derek's transformation from nice young man to a neo-nazi is not convincing at all. "It's nagger bullshot, son!" "Gee, dad, I guess you're right! Racism is awesome!" And his transformation from a neo-nazi to Gandhi. "Haha, a funny magical negro! Who knew that black people had the ability to tell jokes? And he hates the KKK too, what are the odds? We have so much in common..!" At the end of the movie, Derek's brother is shot to death by a black kid. It's just a pointless and depressing ending. It doesn't offer any hope at all. It's sad that American History X is one of the most popular movies about racism. Imagine if they made a movie about real racism, without magical negroes, fake neo-Nazis, liberal propaganda and unnecessary graphic violence and sex. A movie that treated black people like humans. The real Nazis here are the filmmakers. American History X is just a piece of propaganda made by a modern-day Goebbels, designed to make viewers think that conservatives are Nazis and that black people are helpless animals.
It is doubtful whether this disturbing and horrifying film should ever have been made. It is nauseatingly violent, but then so are the kind of people it is based upon. No sensitive person should try to see this, as it is far, far too horrible. The violence is so sickening that it is intolerable. The entire project is of questionable integrity, even though in the latter half, some justification is offered when there is a major change of heart and mind by the lead character. Edward Norton, one of the world's most versatile film actors, gives another staggering performance, as does Edward Furlong as his younger brother. It is all very well done, but should it have been done, that is the question. This film portrays in a way no mainstream film has ever done the extremes and depths of racist hate cults, and we are left with nothing to speculate about as far as American Neo-Nazis are concerned. By the time you have sat through this, you have seen more swastikas than you could find in 'Triumph of the Will', but these are up close and personal, like Norton's tattooed on his chest. The scenes in prison are so far beyond appalling that we run out of shocked adjectives. If you ever wanted to know how Neo-Nazis think, because you just couldn't wait, here it all is. But have plenty of vomit bags handy. I am inclined to think that this is a piece of exploitation masquerading as a serious social and psychological study. Why not make a film about suicide bombers and decapitating people next? But why stop there? There is always bayoneting babies to move onto after that. Can this sort of thing be justified? The fact that it is a well-made film makes it worse. I think our 'need to know' is spurious, and that the people who made this film are all deeply, deeply sick, and should be ashamed of themselves. This film will only stimulate crazies to emulate the insane racists, and I bet tattoo artists get a lot more business after this. Also, the racist attitudes portrayed and statements made in the film are so disgustingly offensive that no one has ever plumbed such depths in a film, and I believe that such unspeakable evil should not be given publicity, and that such maggot-ridden and rotten things should not be brought out into the light. It is a fallacy to think that by showing them anything constructive can be achieved. Elliott Gould in the film looked shell-shocked at the horror of it all. I know how he feels. He should have walked out of the film, not just out of the house. What was he doing, lending his name to this?


                
It can be compared with a pick-pocket who after stealing a wallet starts yelling: Catch that thief, catch that thief!If I were a member of Arian Nation I'd screen this movie as a powerful recruiting tool. All the Nazis wannabes would join with tears in their eyes.A few examples: 1)ALL the fights and trouble are started by African-Americans. 2) Koreans play dirty and get stores from real Americans (please tell me what on earth is a real American) just to fire white employees and hire only illegal immigrants. 3) Hispanics are depicted as bunch of wet-backs who enter the US illegally just to be exploited by greedy Koreans.I have only read twenty comments about this still-born and nobody seems to realize that Nazis are equaled to African-Americans. That is, there are two matching sides, two gangs: on the one hand a bunch of obnoxious nazi skinheads, on the other African-Americans. Not to mention that every relevant African-American character on this movie (by relevant I mean a character who can be seen during ten seconds or more) is a punk, an out-law or a member of gang, -or like Dr. Sweeney, a former member of a gang. Also it should be noted that the director of this thing, underhandedly but also coarsely, drops the idea that the nazi violence is some sort of a reaction against a preceding insult: Nazis are bad, but nazi violence is what you get when African-Americans, Koreans and Mexicans move to your neighborhood, get the all the jobs, win the basket-ball plays and date attractive white women.Intentions behind this libel remind me of the Nazis from the movie Bullet Proof Monk who set a Human Right organization in order to hide their actual intentions.And last but not least, have you counted all those shower slow motion takes. What is this, a shampoo TV commercial?!


                
I can't imagine how people can be moved by such an over-simple and stupid message about racism and intolerance. The moral content of the film is shadeless. Each character is either all good or all bad !!!The whole passage in jail is completely stupid. How a pro nazi can suddenly (after two days) get on well with a black man while pressing clothes together.Such a poor movie...


                
Yeah, it's stunning, all right -- in the way a cattleprod up the old wazoo is stunning. Alleged director Tony Kaye should be grateful to New Line for taking away this ad-hoc piece o' crud, which he admits he winged from a script he never even liked. (Gods of videotape and DVD, please spare us his cut, which he never completed, by the way.) From the very first frames, it's clear that Kaye has no rapport with his actors, and has zero idea how to get decent, let alone consistent, performances out of them. As the buffed-up skinhead leader, Norton tries hard, but he has three different personalities in the film, with the transitions between them either patently phony or (mostly) non-existent. A worthy subject, but this "X"ecrable effort proves why some people are cut out to do 30-second commercials and not grandiose "masterpieces". In short, this guy makes Oliver Stone look the subtlest man on the planet. For all you message- seekers, here's the flick's big payoff: "Hate is baggage". There, you've just been saved eight bucks and two tortured hours.


                
Lame, lame, lame. Poorly directed, muddled piece of garbage. Ed Norton's performance is only slightly embarrassing. Over-simplified message that is at once sensational and boring.


                
Oh how original. A bad young neo-nazi goes to prison, has some experiences and mellows out. Oops, too late. Unrealistic dialogue sounds like the movie was written as a warning for school kiddies. And Edward Norton is the prettiest skinhead I've ever seen.


                
This is nothing but the same mainstream ideology disguised as "edgy", "daring" entertainment. Regardless of one's politics, to see this as anything but agit-prop for hip teenagers is remarkably ignorant. The story is boring and unbelievable, the acting is stiff and unbelievable, and the directing is obvious and amateur.


                
I worked at a video store at the time of this movies release. At first i wasn't interested, then as boredom set in I read the back. It sounded different from the average movie(and I've seen a lot). I took it home to watch. I, for the 2 hours of the play, was mesmerized by the transformation Derek Vinyard had to undergo. My comment is more of a question. Its obvious the movie could have gone on for another hour, to explaining what happened or didn't happen. And I think viewers should see this. I am a white male. I have had many black friends. Some of whom have been better friends than most. The problem of racism will go on long after my lifetime. It doesn't just effect blacks. It affects everyone, both sides of the fence. We need to come together. We need...love.
