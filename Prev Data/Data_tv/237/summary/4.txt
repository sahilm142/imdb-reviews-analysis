 all the negative reviews have something in common.

 Not expected.

 On point!

 It's everything we hoped for!

 Fun, emotional and binge-worthy!

 A true ray of sunshine in a bleak world

 Super fun and touching!

 So happy this show is back

 Powerful show that shows true power of LGBT community!

 Good show to be honest

 Love the show

 This show made me smile, laugh and ugly cry. The Best!

 God Bless Gays

 Socially Conscious Middleground

 Why Be Sad About The Current State Of America When You Could Watch Queer Eyes

 I LOVE THIS SHOW

 Refreshingly Human!

 So well adjusted to the time changes!

 Bye, Bye Binging!

 Pure heart

 My patience wore thin

 Fifteen years and nothing changed.

 Yaaas!
