This movie is about a massive escape from a German prison camp. Unlike the fast paced and intriguing "Stalag 17", this movie is plodding, dull, and yet no more realistic. Everyone looks squeaky clean, which already makes it lack any of the realism of the Holden-Brand classic.A lot of big name stars are in this, led by the contemplative Richard Attenborough. The film tries to draw us into the lives of James Garner and Steve McQueen, but loses us terribly. Every war cliché is in this movie. And the director probably caved in to McQueen's insistence upon the use of motor vehicles, giving us another stupid, boring motorcycle chase no one cares about, except McQueen's red neck club. Even Garner has to get into the driving act by somehow getting a German plane. So much for realism. To top it off, we are treated to the usual cliché of kill the nearsighted man, Hollywood's favorite whipping post, and the subject of heinous prejudice unequaled.You really have to plod through this ordeal. You won't really care about anything or anyone, and will try to occasionally watch between around the house chores, but don't bother. It isn't worth it.
