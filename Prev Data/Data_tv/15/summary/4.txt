 What went wrong?

 Highly overrated and insulting

 Questionable Idea Poorly Executed

 Season 1, pretty good; Season 2, dull and clichéd: Awful

 Pleasssssssssssssssssse

 Just another detective TV show, its not Sherlock Holmes like the book

 No idea why this show is ranked this high

 Come for the first two seasons, leave for the third.

 Season 2 Left a Sour Taste in My Mouth
