A Guy need bicycle for his job sold his bed cover to get a bikebike got stolenhe and his son search the stolen bikecan't get it backTHE ENDOver-rated movie. I can't see why people consider this a masterpiece, more like a piece of crap. Totally over-rated. Thank God I watched this in 4x speed, don't wanna waste more time in this movie.There are many other film deserving the place in Top 250 like Titanic or Avatar. I hope this movie will lose the place in top 250 one day.
Compared to a mindless display of special effects and violence, any serious film about the human condition is welcome. "The Bicycle Thief" is most certainly a serious film about poverty and desperation, and perhaps it was strikingly dramatic at the time it was made - but I do not regard it as a truly great film because the characters do not come alive for me at all. I feel sorry for the main character in a generic kind of way, but that is all. The few details we have about him and his family are kind of arbitrary and vague, so I never felt as if I had gotten to know him as a person. In short, this is a serious film about a difficult time and the desperation of the people who lived through it, but it was neither as informative about that time as a documentary would have been nor as engaging as a dramatic vehicle should have been.
