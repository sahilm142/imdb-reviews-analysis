... is you have to act obnoxious.Don't get me wrong. I love Stephen Colbert. I think the Colbert is second only to the Daily Show in terms of being the greatest show currently on air.However, while I never tire of Jon & the Daily Show, I have to admit Stephen can get a little tiring. Jon has other correspondents but Stephen has to carry the show alone. Stephen is also a little stuck as sort of a one-trick pony. He has to play the same character the same way all the time. And when that character is a moronic ego maniacal bombastic rightwing nutjob a**hole (a la Rush L. & Bill O'R.) that can get a bit tiring.The repeating segments are funny. The Daily "WORD" is hilarious. The threat down (usually BEARS!); the "better know a district"; the "wag of the finger/tip of the hat" segments are something to look forward to each week. He does rely too much on Yahoo news for funny news bits, not so amusing when I've already read them that day.However my biggest disappointment (and I subtracted an entire star for that)is the increasing product placement on the show.I don't know if Stephen has made some sort of deal where he's actually getting paid or what --but he has started promoting brands like (goldenpalace, kraft, etc.) at first I excused it as "he's probably satirizing Rush's pushing of Snapple", but IMHO it's crossing the line into actually advertising. And I'm getting sick of hearing about his B&J ice cream flavor.I find the recent trend to try to do product placement so people don't realize they're watching adds to be really offensive. I hope this doesn't increase.


                
This show was great. I really miss it. Stephen Colbert was awesome on this show, with some wicked smart and funny sketches and interviews. I wish this was still on. I do like him taking over for Letterman he just isn't very funny yet.
