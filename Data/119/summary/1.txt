 Actors do age, so do the movies and this one is the perfect example

 Definitely not worth 4 Oscars,if any..

 Poor and forgettable

 Second most overrated film of all time

 less than meets the eye and even less the ear

 Who ever gave this film an Oscar is unforgivable!!!!

 Clint Eastwood is such a BAD director!

 Jist Plain Ridiklus

 Cinematic Torture

 This Film won 4 Oscars ... and i'm not sure how that's possible (FULL OF SPOILERS)

 For guys only

 Slow, boring and a typical Academy winner.
