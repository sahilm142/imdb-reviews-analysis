Charlie Chaplin was funny. Charles Laughton was witty. As good as 'Witness For The Prosecution' is---Agatha Christie's story, the other actors, the technical expertise---the Oscar-nominated Laughton is THE reason to see this film. What he brings to Billy Wilder's 1957 courtroom thriller is his tremendous wit and intellect. It's a serious story, but the dark-comic tag team of Wilder/Laughton upgraded the film from "a good courtroom mystery" to "a classic of the courtroom genre".The headlining star, Tyrone Power, sure doesn't help them very much. He plays anguish about as smoothly as ripped sandpaper...and anguish is the unfortunate emotion he's got to play for most of the picture. Power has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. His wife (Marlene Dietrich) seems to be doing all she can to sell him out, appearing as...drum roll, please, drummer man...the star witness for the prosecution. Laughton is the brilliant (and ailing) English barrister defending Power. The plot twists 'n' turns a dozen ways from Sunday, just as it always does in Christie's best work.Amongst all the talk of bloody murder, there are running gags about cigars and alcohol. More dark wit---Laughton's character's poor health might cause him to drop dead at any moment. Wilder weaved thrills and smiles as well as any director. In this, he was wise to anchor the supporting cast with mainstays of the stiff upper lip. John Williams and Ian Wolfe (Hirsch from "WKRP"), not to mention Laughton's control-freak assistant Elsa Lanchester (who was also CL's real-life wife), are bloody good.Movies of this type have been ripped off so often that students of the "don't give away the ending" class are bound to figure it out. I did. That hardly mattered because there were STILL more surprises to come. Through all that plot, Dietrich winds up being the most fascinating character. Project back and you'll realize how well her performance works. But she & Power are merely the star attractions in 'Witness For The Prosecution'. The main dish is Charles Laughton. Considering how ironic and cynical our society has become, it's stunning that brilliant old pros like Wilder and Laughton aren't more popular today. After this movie, they've become personal heroes of mine.
Billy Wilder is a director with an understanding of cinema that is almost unmatched throughout the medium's entire history - that's why his films are always so good. Witness for the Prosecution is yet another highlight in the great director's history, and it proves that courtroom dramas can be both riveting and a great opportunity for some first rate comedy. Wilder's film features one of the most well paced plots I've ever seen in a film, and it's a plot that includes some very finely tuned twists. Towards the end, Wilder bombards us with twist after twist, each one both making sense and topping the one before it. In a time when people are impressed by films such as 'The Sixth Sense', Billy Wilder still shows us how to skilfully attribute a twist into a film's plot. The plot itself follows the story of Sir Wilfrid Robarts; an ace defence lawyer that has been told that his health won't allow him to tackle anything more than mundane cases, but is brought back into the fray when a case involving the murder of an elderly woman comes into his hands. Wilfrid must now juggle the case and his health as he attempts to keep the young man from being sent down.Like all Wilder films, this one is a very pleasurable viewing. Wilder manages to find a middle ground between substance and entertainment, and so this is a film that will please fans of both aspects. The film is deliriously entertaining throughout, with some truly great lines of dialogue (most of which is very quotable) and every twist adds a new level to the story. The substance comes from a multitude of angles, and themes of love, health, sacrifice and most notably, justice, are all more than prevalent. The acting is certainly of note in Witness for the Prosecution. Charles Laughton is absolutely sublime as the undermining and stubborn Wilfrid Robarts; his performance is very strong, and makes up the backbone of the film. The main supporting performance comes from Marlene Dietrich. I'm not a big fan of hers; despite having a great pair of legs, she just doesn't do anything for me, but in this film she brings sufficient coldness to her character and really makes it her own. The final main performance comes from Tyrone Power; he isn't as great as the other two, but does enough with his character to ensure he's believable. Highly recommended viewing!


                
Entertaining suspense movie packs thrills , intrigue , twists and turns ; being realized in Hitchcock style . As the tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses including sensational acting , enjoyable dialog and interesting screenplay from start to finish . Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is detained on suspicion of killing an elderly acquaintance . He employs an experienced but aging barrister, Sir Wilfrid (Charles Lawton) as his defense attorney who is recovering from a severe heart attack . The ill advocate at law is attended by a nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester , they were real-life husband and wife). Excellent film packs drama , emotion , suspense and plot twists . This agreeable and often intriguing picture from master of comedy has a memorable scene after another . It contains interesting intrigue based on Agatha Christie's novel , fun intrigue , amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The film followed the basic story of Agatha Christie's play, but director and co-screenwriter Billy Wilder opened up the story by including numerous scenes that did not take place solely in the courtroom, as the play had, and changed the emphasis from "Leonard Vole" to "Sir Wilfrid Robarts¨. Top-notch and unforgettable performance from Charles Laughton as the peculiar as well as intelligent barrister , throwing himself into the role with dedication and delight . Nice acting by Tyrone Power , this would be his last complete film , he would die of a heart attack while on the set of his next film (Salomon) less than one year after release of this one . Sensational support cast , including familiar faces such as Elsa Lanchester , John Williams , Henry Daniell , Ruta Lee , Torin Thatcher and veteran Ian Wolfe . Special mention for Una O'Connor , this was Una O'Connor's last big screen motion picture and she was the only member of the original Broadway cast of the play to repeat her role on film . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Russell Harlan . The producers were so concerned about the financial success of the film that during the credits, an announcer urges the audience not to reveal the film's ending to anyone . Lavishly produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and Edward Small , as the courtroom setting, which cost $75,000 to build, was a recreation of an actual courtroom in London's Central Criminal Courts , The Old Bailey. The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines , amusing dialogues , humor and entertaining intrigue . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , this ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Witness for prosecution¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching .

Alfred Hitchcock once remarked that he often had fans approaching him to say how much they enjoyed 'Witness for the Prosecution (1957).' Knowing Hitch's wicked sense of humour, he probably would have gone along with it, but that doesn't change the fact that the film belongs to Billy Wilder, however reminiscent of a Hitchcock picture it might be. Adapted from a short story, and subsequently a play, by mystery author Agatha Christie, the film has a distinct theatrical feel to it, the story gradually unfolding mostly through dialogue, with the occasional important flashback. Just as 'Witness for the Prosecution' feels like the work of the Master of Suspense, it noticeably lacks the classy style of the actual director, with the confines of the courtroom drama perhaps unsuited to Wilder's trademark sparkling repartee {though Charles Laughton certainly gets in a few masterful wise-cracks}. Nevertheless, it is a genuinely thrilling and engaging mystery with an ensemble of terrific characters.Charles Laughton's Sir Wilfrid Robarts is an outrageously entertaining creation. Though having only recently recovered from a crippling heart attack, the attorney maintains a constant state of grumpiness, gruffly dismissing the well-meaning instructions of his insistent nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's wife, Elsa Lanchester). Though his health often causes him problems, and he hardly seems to be paying attention in the courtroom, Sir Wilfrid is the finest defence lawyer that the city has to offer, a shrewd and calculating legal genius, and a firm believer in the judicial process. When an agitated and seemingly-innocent young man, Leonard Steven Vole (Tyrone Power), is charged for the murder of an older lady friend (Norma Varden), our weary hero commits himself to proving the man's innocence in court, even though their chances of acquittal are seriously marred when the accused man's German "wife" (Marlene Dietrich) testifies against him.Much too often, time has ruined some of cinema's greatest twist-endings, and it always grieves me to have the finales of classic thrillers spoiled before I have the opportunity to watch them. In the case of 'Witness for the Prosecution,' I can happily say that I was caught completely off-guard, having not even been aware that the film contained a twist. Better yet, Agatha Christie manages, in the story's final moments, to cram in a quick succession of unexpected plot-turns, with the ending leaving us stunned and dazed, feeling as foolish and devastated as Sir Wilfrid must have been when he realised that he had just unknowingly rescued a certain murderer from punishment. Most definitely in the top five courtroom films I've ever seen, Billy Wilder's 'Witness for the Prosecution' is a different kind of classic for its legendary director, and a motion picture that, yes, I'm sure even Hitchcock would have loved.
I just finished watching Live Free and Die Harder for the second time. I was blown away by the special effects, and Bruce Willis' capability to take more punishment than a human could be expected to and live.After that I wanted something that had the same fireworks but done with acting and not special effects. This film fit the bill nicely.The acting in this film was so spectacular that calls for every superlative in the book. While I have watched Billy Wilder direct comedy, I never expected to see him do something that rivals Hitchcock. In fact, if you didn't know it was Wilder beforehand, you would easily call this a Hitchcock film.Tyrone Power as the defendant was so smooth that you knew he was a guilty man. You just knew it, even though he kept denying it. He was perfect as the cad that preys on elderly women. Marlene Dietrich gave what I thought was the performance of a lifetime as his wife. She definitely provided the fireworks and the surprises to this film. Charles Laughton as the barrister that tried the case was magnificent. There are not enough words to describe the performance he provided. Supreme enjoyment every time he opened his mouth. Of course, you cannot ignore Elsa Lanchester as the nurse that failed miserably at trying to control Laughton after a heart attack. The two of them provided so much humor to this film that one would want to see it again and again just for that.Nothing can be said about the film without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. It is well worth the time in finding it on cable or adding it to your queue.


                
This Billy Wilder-directed adaptation of Agatha's Christie's Witness For the Prosecution features Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton, and these three leads could easily have appeared in a 1937 version, except that Christie hadn't written it yet, and so this film is from 1957. It's a story about a man on trial for the murder of a woman he'd only fairly recently become acquainted with who left him a large sum of money in her will, and who has a flimsy alibi as to his whereabouts on the night of the murder, and is in very deep trouble indeed. Fortunately for him, a first rate lawyer has agreed to take his case, and all kinds of complications ensue till the surprise ending, in which everything comes together, but not as the first time viewer might have expected.There's a lot of good and bad in the film. The good is a tight script; and a a bravura performance from Laughton as the lawyer (okay, barrister) with health problems; Laughton's real life wife, Elsa Lanchester, as his nurse, is delightful; Tyrone Power, as the accused, is nicely enigmatic and ambiguous; Marlene Dietrich, as Power's neglected war bride wife brings her own special brand of charisma to her role; while John Williams, Una O'Connor, Henry Daniell and Ian Wolfe are all splendid in supporting parts. As to the bad, the movie is dull looking, resembling an episode of a television series of its time. It lacks the fine tuning of the best of Hitchcock, or for that matter Billy Wilder. The pacing could be better. While I wouldn't call the movie slow moving it never at any point really catches fire. It feels rather chilly throughout. There's not much in the art direction or the photography to draw the viewer in. Wilder serves his material and doesn't bring much of himself to the party.What keeps the thing humming is its plot, which is a good one. Ty Power uses his charm skillfully in his early scenes, yet seems to lose focus later on. Laughton brings gravitas to his role but somehow fails to bring the much needed moral authority his character presumably possesses, which is absent from the actor's performance. Too often Laughton just seems to be indulging himself, which is fun to watch but not really right for his character. Dietrich seems to be working extra hard and actually convinces me that she is or could be Power's wife.Overall, Witness For the Prosecution feels like a "leisure movie" for its director. Wilder wasn't exactly slumming when he made it, but he wasn't running on six cylinders, either. It plays well enough, keeps the viewer's attention, yet lacks a certain heart, fire, intensity, something that might have elevated it to the level of a classic. It's definitely worth a peek if one likes murder mysteries, but it's not in the same league as Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder, which is a far more engaging movie. There's no flamboyance and little style to Witness. As a footnote it's worth mentioning that this was Tyrone Power's last or nearly last movie. He shows himself to good advantage, as it mustn't have been easy to for this middle-aged former matinée idol to have played a murder suspect named Leonard Vole. Power was clearly moving in a character star direction, and doing well at it. Had he lived longer and continued in the same vein he might have given Dirk Bogarde a run for his money over the next decade.


                
The combination of Agatha Christie's play, Billy Wilder's fluid direction, and superlative performances by Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Tyrone Power combine to make this film quite extraordinary, if outré. Laughton plays a brandy-swilling English barrister defending Power on the charge of murder; Dietrich is Power's German wife, who claims her husband is guilty; Elsa Lanchester (never better) is Laughton's devoted nurse and John Williams (superior, as always) is his legal assistant. Don't be put off by the powdered wigs or the legalese; Wilder keeps this intriguing case peppered with amusing incident, and the double-twist finale is staged with aplomb. If it's a bit over-the-top, that's forgivable, for the picture is full of "actors" (on the surface and undercover) and everyone here has a grand time. *** from ****


                
Christie is one of our most treasured and adventuresome experimenters in narrative twisting and knotting. She's a master of taking popular material and packaging it in complex ways that are accessible. Wilder is a master on the converse: taking sometimes complex material and packaging it in simply accessible ways.There's a mismatch that works against the material in these two strengths. Still, Wilder pulls off what is the best Christie adaptation in the sense that he retains the possibility of figuring things out, though Deitrich's disguise is pretty thin.Christie tried every way she could map of shifting our expectations of who is providing truthful elements of what we see, or think we see. In this case, it is folded into a play within the play in the form of acting for the benefit of a jury. The twists are in the liar, the intent and the guilt.Funny thing about Wilder. He made competent movies of all types, including the two folded masterpieces: this and "Sunset Blvd." But he doesn't seem to have captured a lot of subsequent filmmakers in his wake, while Christie has, By the hundreds.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.
The perfect movie for insomniacs like myself who caught this epic courtroom drama on TCM commercial free with no interruptions.Our story begins with a renown British Barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts played by Charles Laughton. Sir Roberts, stout yet refined complete with monocle recovering from a recent heart ailment is cared for by his personal nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster) who was in reality Laughton's real Wife. The arguments and condescending quips being thrown by Sir Roberts at the overbearing nurse was probably as close to the real home life of the Laughton's as you can get. Enter the distressed, accused, and care-warned Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power). Miss Plimsoll strongly objects to her personal patient taking on any cases after Sir Robert's ailment. Sir Roberts hears out Voles statement as the accused claims his innocents to the murder of Mrs. Emily French a rich older woman who was fond with Vole, infatuated as to go so far as to make him the beneficiary to her will. I Personally enjoyed the credible performance here by Power as I the viewer, was convinced of his innocence done so naturally and humbly, Unparalleled acting. Sir Roberts takes the case under the consternation of his dictatorial nurse yet smooth as silk in his retorts to his nurse were just as caustic which gave the film comic relief throughout the entire film entwined in this unique murder trial. Vole claims to Sir Roberts that his Wife would testify on his behalf. Enter the cold, self assured Mrs. Christine Vole (Marlene Dietrich) who tells Roberts and his colleagues a different story which quashes any alibi's for Vole. Vole is arrested swiftly and detained. The flashback scenes in Post-War Germany when Leonard talks about how a ceiling fell on him during his first meeting with Christine at a makeshift nightclub packed with eager G.I.'s who attacked her, ripped her pants. Dietrich showcases her talents with song and accordion. The trial begins with a cavalcade of familiar British heavy's known for television work in the 60's. Familiars like John Williams as Brogan Moore, (Robert's right hand in legal matters), who temporarily replaced Sebastian Cabot as the butler on the sit-com Family Affair. William exposure on American television was wide spread with a popular commercial for decades about classical masterpieces. Henry Daniell as Mayhew known to TV viewers as a frequent player in Boris Karloff's Thriller. Other familiars actors not born on the British Isles despite the queens tongue are Ian Wolfe as Carter known for his roles in Star Trek. The ever present Torin Thatcher as the Prosecutor Myers who was frequent guest on Science fiction related shows. Lost in Space,Time Tunnel, Voyage to the Bottom of The Sea and Star Trek. FYI last film for Tyrone Power who died a year later of a massive heart attack and last film for veteran actress Una O'Conner. Fabulous ending with tremendous shock value which felt like a Hitchcock film but Billy Wilder always gets lost in this masterpiece. His best directorial to date, but the book by Agatha Christy had more impact than the film but doesn't Hollywood always water-down screen plays to suit actors and budget. Laughton's performance was outstanding and that comedic timing impeccable.
Witness for the Prosecution (1957)Billy Wilder is one of the three or four really great directors coming out of post-war Hollywood. "Double Indemnity" and "Sunset Blvd" and even "The Apartment" are flawless films. Flawless and brilliant, visually flashy, inventive, and touching. And Wilder was more prolific as a writer than a director, and in "Witness for the Prosecution" there is less of the cinematic genius and more of the literary one. He had one of the great popular storytellers of Britain of the time at his side, too--Agatha Christie. In fact, it's an expanded version of one of her stories. Some of the repartee between the leading lawyer, played by Charles Laughton, and his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester, is especially funny when you know they were married at the time.The other great actress here of course is Marlene Dietrich, who is cold and clever and virtuosic. They even have a flashback so she can play, twenty-five years after the fact, the kind of entertaining role she was known for in the days of Josef von Sternberg (as in "The Blue Angel"--the little nightclub in "Witness" is even called the Blue Lantern). The key to the whole story is the plot, which is smart and believable. The acting is lively, and the whole enterprise is far funnier than you'd expect (even the judge is witty). There are twists and then more twists. If the camera-work isn't Billy Wilder's best, it is still fluid and functional. (We can't blame the cameraman, the brilliant Russell Harlan, who did any number of visually astonishing movies, like "Gun Crazy," for starters.) As much as this is a very British seeming film, and of course Christie is very British in her material and style, the whole enterprise was filmed in California. You'll never know it, however. A terrific film.


                
It's stunning! great work in screenplay and directed by accuracy and obsession in detail!


                
No need to recap plot or consensus points. In many years of movie viewing I've never seen an uglier mug fill up the screen as often as Laughton's. Congratulations to Hollywood for breaking the pretty-face rule. But it's really no problem since it's Laughton's grumpily forceful manner that commands attention. Then there's his real life wife, Lanchester. Their scenes together are absolutely delicious I wonder how they were at home. The screenplay is a champ at byplay without clouding the plot. In fact it's hard to guess where the murder mystery is going until the final surprise upshot, so the audience stays fully engaged. And for an enclosed courtroom drama, it's a real challenge to keep viewer attention focused. Yet the writers do, mainly with vividly drawn characters. On the whole, there's more character revelation than development as the drama plays out in the present tense courtroom. And since there's no action to speak of, the compelling result amounts a real triumph of both actors and writers combined. In passinggood to see movie vets like Daniell, Wolfe, and Varden picking up screen time and paydays. But thank goodness, O'Connor's snarling old lady doesn't play anyone's grandmother. Otherwise she could ruin the whole idea.


                
***SPOILERS****Recovering from a near-fatal heart-attack British barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, Charles Laughton,is under doctor's orders to keep away from being involved in anything stressful like defending a client facing the death penalty. As soon as Sir Wilfrid is back in his London law office he's faced with what he's told, by his doctor and colleagues, to avoid a man on trial for his life and against his, and those working for him, better judgment Sir Wilford takes the case.Agreeing to defend Leonard Vole, Tyrone Power, in the murder of Emily French, Norma Varden, a lady friend of his Sir Wilfrid feels certain that Vole is telling the truth in that he had nothing to do with Mrs. French's murder. It's that Vole is so open to where he was at the time of her murder by him being at home with his German-born wife Christine, Marlena Dietrich. There's also the fact that he was never arrested or served time for anything of a criminal nature in his life. Vole in fact even did admit that he knew Mrs. French and was at her home a number of times trying to get her to finance a new egg-beater that he invented and was only on the best terms with her. So why would he murder her unless it was a crime of passion which was very unlikely for the happily married Leonard Vole.At the trial things suddenly start to go a bit sour for Vole in that he was in Mrs. French's will giving him most of her saving some 80,000 pound sterling! Mrs. French housekeeper Mrs. McKenzie, Una O'Connor, also throws a wrench in the defenses wheels to get Vole off by saying that she heard him and her late employer Mr. French have a violent augment just minutes before she found her dead in the living room. Sir Wilfrid easily dismisses Mrs. McKenzie's accusations by showing the judge and jury that she's very hard of hearing so how could she have overheard Vole and Mrs. French arguing with the door to the living room, four inches of thick oak wood, shut tight. There's also the fact that Mrs. McKenzie didn't receive the 80,000 pound sterling, that she felt that she deserved, was a good reason for her to want Vole to get, what she feels, what so rightfully deserves life imprisonment or even worse, or better, the rope.The big surprise at the trial is when Vole's loving wife Christine suddenly shows up to be a witness for the prosecution against her husband. Christine totally contradicts the story that she told Sir Wilfrid about Vole being at home with her when the crime was committed. Christina's testimony put her husband at the scene of the crime and even worse he actually told her that he in fact did kill Mrs. French. There's also the fact that Christine wasn't legally married to Vole, she was still married to a German national, which made it legally possible that she could testify against him.Stunned that he's somehow being set up to take the fall, through the gallows trapdoor, by Christine and whoever he thinks she's involved with, her lover?, the betrayed and emotionally drained Volve almost has a breakdown right in the courtroom. With lawyer Sir Wilfrid being left with no one to contradict Christine's utterly damaging testimony it's all but a forgone conclusion that his client Leonard Vole will be convicted of first degree murder. Just when everything seems lost for the defense an unexpected surprise witness turns up who not only has the goods on Christine, in proving that she lied under oath, but also has a score of love letters in Christine's handwriting, to her secret lover Max, showing the real reason why she's railroading her confused and befuddled husbands neck straight into the hangman's noose.The movie has a number of wild and unexpected surprises in it that culminates with the mother of all surprise endings as well as double-crosses that just about blows everyone, most of all the just recovered heart-attack victim Sir Wilfrid, away. Almost speechless at what transpired before his own eyes Sir Wilfrid in effect unknowingly gave those who later engineered this outrage of the British justice system. Sir Wilfrid gave them that idea by bringing up how unrealistic and dangerous it would be to Vole's chances of being found innocent with his wife testifying in his favor which in effect, by some strange and convoluted reason, lead her to testify against him!The surprise witness who engineered the mind boggling ending of the movie and convinced the jury and everyone else in the courtroom of Vole's obvious innocence in Mrs. Frenchs murder was not the biggest surprise in the film. The really big one was saved after the trial was over and it was that what made the movie the both shocking and effective as well as the financial and critical success that it turned out to be.


                
The best thing about the film is not the witty dialogues or the amazing character development or the brilliant Charles Laughton, it's the ending. Not in the way that it's a completely surprising twist (which it was even though it was hidden in plain sight), but in the way that how politically progressive the twist was. By feeding the social stigma up till then, never losing focus on how exactly it is portrayed and suddenly exposing the truth of it and letting the viewers know why a lot of it is actually portrayed the way it is in the film. I think this may get a higher rating from me after I give it time to sink in.


                
I grew up reading her novels and it was a pleasure to watch it act out on screen.Her stories are always simple, and its the same here - A guy befriends an older woman in the hopes that she might sponsor his invention (an egg beater). She is murdered. He was the last person that she saw. Evidence is scant.What Agatha Christie does is build up full characters and give us nearly full information. When the movie is done, and we look back, its the simplicity that absolutely stands out. She is like a brilliant engineer.And there is beautiful heart touching love included in its core. Just go see it, its more fulfilling that an Avengers movie.


                
Serio-Comic Play by acclaimed Writer Agatha Christie that was hugely Successful, made into a Movie by the ever enjoyable Billy Wilder. Most of the Charm here is from the Actors and all are in Fantastic Form. There are very few Cinematic flourishes and it plays more like a Play than a Movie.It is undeniably Witty and holds the interest and has Twists and Turns that are the Author's trademark. It takes place in England ("where's my wig?") but that Tradition only adds to the backdrop of all the Silliness that takes place from Laughton and Lancaster. The Power/Dietrich combo provide the Serious part and Marlene is Stunning if Tyrone Suffers a bit from Miscasting, but still manages to pull it off in His Last Screen Role.The combination of the Talent involved made this a surefire Success and it has a Regal Reputation. Your Enjoyment will no doubt be Determined on Your Taste and Tolerance for this type of Crime/Comedy/Romp with its Dialog driven, enclosed Theatrical Restraints, and High-Brow Hubristic Humor.


                
For a movie released in 1957 this is quite an exceptional cinematic masterpiece.Except for Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power who displayed horrendous amounts of Overacting the entire cast was fantabulous.Charles Laughton's splendid performance coupled with Francis Compton's witty retorts make for compelling reasons for someone to watch the movie.A great legal thriller with the some typically 50's sensibilities and some uncharacteristically smart witticisms for that era...I recommend it to anyone who like good cinema....go ahead!


                
Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is wonderful due to skilled stage actors, especially Charles Laughton, allowed to "do their thing.""Their thing" isn't seen any more in the present age (2009) because stage plays have almost disappeared and are only a memory supported by a great film like this, and that's a shame. Camera tricks, movie magic, light shows, special effects and pyrotechnics, virtuoso editing never contributed to good stage acting and good stage presentations.Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is good because writing and the acting are allowed to dominate the movie in a setting (mostly a British "Old Bailey" large courtroom) which is well designed and plausible, but which doesn't change, and certainly never becomes the star of the movie.The actors and the story carry the movie. The script allows actors to declaim at length, and with actors as good as most in Witness For The Prosecution (1957), that'a a treat.The only actor who doesn't carry his part of the movie is Tyrone Power (1914 - 1958), then only one year away from his early death from a heart attack at age 44, and obviously overweight and in bad physical health and without energy or power his part called for.He was used anyway because he was "good box office" in spite of his obvious bad health and need to avoid movie stardom pressures and challenges.Heartless Hollywood strikes again, as so often in movie history.He turned the lead role of "Leonard Vole" in the movie down at first, then accepted when he was offered $300,000 plus a percentage of the movie's profits. He is seen with his top suit coat button attached to hide his pot belly and protruding stomach, since a normal front middle button attachment wasn't possible.Every other actor in the movie shines, except Tyrone Power, and the others are so good, and the script is so good and allows great actors to perform without interruption, one wonders why the success formula wasn't repeated much or ever after Witness For The Prosecution (1957) was made.One answer may be that the times changed..... "the theater" (i.e. the world of dramatic stage plays performed by skilled actors) disappeared, sadly. The actors seen in The Witness For The Prosecution (1957) were mostly older actors trained before WWII in England at a time when "the theater" was still alive and well there, and actors were taught their trade with the expectation there would always be a place and need for good actor work on the stage. This expectation was never the case with the movies. Movies don't depend on good actors the way the stage always did, just as movies don't depend on good writing which isn't needed for "good box office" due in part to the low tastes of many younger moviegoers whose money supports the movie industry.

Set in London, Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is charged with the murder of a wealthy older woman and retains the services of a noted but ailing barrister Sir William Robarts (Charles Laughton). The tension rises though when Vole's wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich) who was initially prepared to provide an alibi for her husband is called as a witness for the prosecution.In a role created for the film Elsa Lanchester plays Robarts exasperating nurse Miss Plimsoll, Laughton and Lanchester were husband and wife. The film is based on a short story and later play by Agatha Christie and directed by the multiple Oscar winner Billy Wilder. Whether the credit is due more to Christie or Wilder is immaterial as the film creates a wonderful sense of anticipation, tension and suspense as the story is revealed.In addition the film features a wonderful starring performance by Charles Laughton and strong support all the principles; Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and, Elsa Lanchester. The film also features the last screen appearance of the memorable character actress Una O'Connor who plays the murder victims housekeeper..While the film did not win any Oscars it did garner an impressive six nominations including; Best Picture, Best Actor (Charles Laughton), Best Supporting Actress (Elsa Lanchester), Best Director, Best Editing and Best Sound.
Although a little boring at times (I'm only 14 so I suppose it's understandable) this was a very, very good movie. The script is absolutely superb - very witty and intelligent. I found the start a bit slow and boring - but once it got into the courtroom it went zooming off. The twists and plot turns are extremely good and creative; all actors shine in their roles, especially Marlene Dietrich. It's the first movie I've ever seen her in and I was sort of surprised at the way she talks but she definitely can do all sorts of roles! Tyrone Power was very good as well - first movie I've seen him in! I was really impressed with the script, acting and twists. Add all these ingredients together and you've got a great movie.


                
8 out of 10. Quite witty, particularly the exchanges between peppy Elsa Lanchester and sulky Charles Laughton, real-life husband and wife. Laughton is coaxed out of recuperation from an illness to defend handsome young Tyrone Power, indicted for the murder of a wealthy old lady. Marlene Dietrich is quite good. Great little twist ending. Good fun.


                
Witness For the Prosecution is a modest, meticulous, intelligent and analytical little Agatha Christie yarn with rich, interesting characters, eloquent arguments in and out of court, and a story pointing for you to look one way while it reaches for the light switch with the other arm, turning off the lights and making you scramble with curiosity and determination. It works beautifully the way the perfectly satisfactory mystery, caper, or crime should be organized. The film is strictly for the purpose of logically plodding through a very baffling murder case, and is devoid completely of emotion, because the film is not at all driven by its characters. It's all about the mechanics of the story and its twists, and thus the reactions of its characters. It's the perfect dry English mystery.Charles Laughton is the highest point of the film, the unlikely hero of the picture, an old and fat barrister with a rebellious disdain for his health and an unpleasant attitude. He is one of the most likable protagonists I've seen in quite awhile. Tyrone Power is brilliant, however, in a supporting role as the truly and completely befuddling defendant, who is simply the most unsure thing about the mystery as we weave through it nervously. He's wonderful. Marlene Dietrich, in her big role, plays a most interesting and provocative piece of the puzzle, yet her performance is as dry as a raisin. In any point where she shows any sort of emotion, facially she seems quite the same. I'd love to see what she's like when she witnesses a fatal car wreck. The same? But she is a great mood control, as Christie's story is a masterpiece of cold English guess-who.Wilder's direction is a careful change of step for him, a very clean and distanced piece of film-making. Feeling is given to pace, scenery, and story, but not a charged passion given to the people as well like with The Lost Weekend or Stalag 17. It's that neat, elegant thriller we all love to watch in a comfy chair in the living room with a blanket and a fire.


                
Aa a writer, I am neither a fan of Billy Wilder nor of Agatha Christie. But I must agree with the majority of viewers who in the case of "Witness For the prosecution" found the central character played by Charles Laughton to be a valuable and ethical hero for the proceedings, and I must further second their positive reactions to the logic, fun and intriguing twists introduced into the trial depicted and into Laughton's attempts to figure out who actually did the crime. On the surface, the film appears to have the advantage of an unusually skilled cast and a director who worked on the screenplay himself from Larry Marcus's adaptation of a Christie shorter work, with Harry Kurnitz. The cinematographer was the skilled Russell Harlan, art director Alexander Trauner and set decorator Howard Bristol. Costumes were provided by Edith Head with the music being composed by Matty Melneck. But the showpiece here is Wilder's fluid directing of a complex story-line. When Sir Wilfrid Robarts, cautioned by his doctors not to take on anything strenuous ignores those orders, obviously an interesting case, and one promising legal 'fireworks' may be in order. The barrister's client, Leonard Vole, is being accused of murder and swears he did not do the crime. Elsa Lanchester is Sir Wilfrid' nurse, cautioning him and insisting on medical regularities that interfere with his pursuit of the truth and of an acquittal for his client, played curiously flat and somewhat as an habitual repressing liar by Tyrone Power. Also in the cast are such fine performers as Henry Daniell, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, Norma Varden, Una O'Connor, Francis Compton, Philip Tonge, Ruta Lee, Franklyn Farnum. and J. Pat O'Malley, among others. The plot revolves about the testimony of Vole's German wife, played with bite and intelligence by Marlene Dietrich, then fifty, the eponymous witness. Fireworks in court are nothing when set beside the issue of Laughton's health and the plot-twists that come fast and furious near the ending. This is a superior film which makes a dramatic work out of a mystery short story adventure; this focus change turns the attention of the viewer from the solution of a baffling murder to the confrontations among those involved in the case--opposing barristers, witnesses, authorities, Laughton, Dietrich, Power and everyone concerned. This is not a great film,m but it always an intelligently written, swift-paced and entertaining piece of Hitchcock-style film-making. The B/W format is a distinct asset here, as is the very-fine acting in general. Certainly one of Wilder's best directorial achievements.


                
I was rather surprised to discover just how good this is, not quite the masterpiece that is Double Indemnity but surely preferable to the rather stiff Sunset Boulevard. Based upon an Agatha Christie short story and play, it was suggested to Wilder by Marlena Deitrich and he developed it with great skill, beefing up the role to be taken (over!) by Charles Laughton and introducing the notion of his recent heart attack and need for accompanying nurse, providing a fine role for Elsa Lanchester. Laughton is fantastic and clearly prevented from going over the top by the director, Tyrone Power is perfectly adequate in this his final film and Dietrich looks very good and tries very hard but is one of those actors who just does it and you either like it or don't. Didn't get the feeling Wilder has much say over her interpretation but it still works. it works because the director has such a grip on the whole and as he himself has said the Christie construction is so sound. Very entertaining with amusing asides and many a wondrous twist to a seemingly simple tale.


                
A really well thought out film that keeps you guessing throughout. With a really solid end
