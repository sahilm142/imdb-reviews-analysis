 Excellent!

 Breathtakingly good show

 Netflix gamble is a definite winner!

 Lives up to the potential, Feels like an HBO Production

 I knew it... Pathetic...

 First three episodes: No expense spared

 Unbelievably Fantastic... the kind of in depth show you pray for

 What a huge let down after some excellent seasons

 Acting is top notch

 Fantastic show - ignore the hysteria!

 Great five seasons!

 Interesting and Realistic Series.

 Season 2

 Fantastic show - ignore the hysteria!

 Brilliant Work On The Subject I Hate. <U+2666> 94%

 Brilliant!

 HOC S1-5 S6 doesn't exist

 Loved seasons 1-5

 Incredible. Exceeded my expectations.

 Excellent original series from Netflix.

 Astonishingly good

 Togetherness of The Best And The Worst

 Quality of a TV drama but...

 Anyone can wear a ring, but only Underwood uses it as a mallet.

 A "Love to hate" relationship.
