 Movie Odyssey Review #022.1: Passion of Joan of Arc

 The real history in every lines!!!

 One of the best female performances in the cinema's history

 extremely good, artsy but dated movie

 better if you watch it more than once

 That Male Attire

 A film so heartbreakingly realistic and brutally honest it might even bring tears to your eyes

 One of the Most Formally Striking Movies I've Ever Seen

 The Passion In Christ

 Breathtaking Performance in a Religion-Based film.

 One of the All-Time Greatest Movies

 Filled with visual power

 The Nerve, The Vision

 Voices of Light score

 I am very impressed with the excellence of this 75 year old film

 One of the better movies of the silent era

 Beautifully shot work in the art of facial expression
