 Remember Those Hollywood Studio Epics? Me Either. But We're Covered.

 A Powerful Blow

 There Will Be Blood - Amateur Review

 Anderson's best film since Hard Eight

 Brooding masterpiece from Paul Thomas Anderson.

 Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job playing a maniacal and, shall I say, oily character

 Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance of his career.

 Unconventional brilliance

 Shot at Greatness!

 A real thinking persons movie, very profound!!!

 This is one of the greatest performances I've seen in a long time; it is so great that it is absolutely terrifying at times.

 Superbly-acted American epic

 A modern fable of greed that is both gorgeous and terrifying...

 Why So Many People Hate This Excellent Movie...

 Milkshake?

 There will be a Mr. Anderson ...

 A Modern Masterpiece

 A very powerful film and different on the subject

 Floored. Period.

 Worth Your Time

 So, ladies and gentlemen... if I say I'm an oil man you will agree.

 One of its kind

 It's All Daniel Day-Lewis ...And Rightfully So

 Oh Yes, There Will Be Blood

 There won't be much talking, though ... (SPOILERS)
