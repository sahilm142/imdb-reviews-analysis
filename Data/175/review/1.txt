One of Hitchcock's worst.The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for.I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons.Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.
This was an average movie.Not more not less.The camera angles and shadow techniques of Hitchcock saved the film and turned a bad movie into a fair one.Best picture Oscar?I don't think so.The acting was also good and the actors had to do as much as their skills would allow to bring life to a limited screenplay.......


                
If there was an Oscar for most boring picture, Rebecca surely deserves it. Rebecca made my fall asleep. Besides being boring, the film had no story and a lack of suspense. Hitchcock at his worst. Again, this film is boring. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
