 The best TV series in Romanian Language, or: as good as it gets

 Finally a Romanian TV series worth watching!

 Romanian gem

 great director in need of a better scriptwriter

 Romanian sopranos

 Changed my perspective about Romanian cinematography

 Captivating story

 A hidden gem

 A definitely must watch for Romanian TV show enthusiasts

 Sooo, Romania did it!

 Following the American action/drama formula

 Surprise

 Good for Romanian action/drama/crime TV Series, but too much cliché

 Brutal yet clever and genuine.

 Great first season with a poor follow up

 Relu Oncescu is no Tony Soprano

 The best romanian movie ever

 Wow

 Great first season and a fantastic second one

 Surprisingly meaty and catchy series with comic elements

 It's a pity you stopped shooting this gorgeous series
