A young girl's five emotions try to solve her identity crisis caused by moving, but when the wrong levers in brain's control center are pushed, things go awry. That synopsis made me push watching this further and further ahead to, but I loved Docter's masterpiece "Up" so I had to watch this in a theater while I still could. Me and my partner thought, well, not really expecting much, so it will probably be OK. But oh what a disappointment it was. OK, I admit we are not teens. And love Japanese animation. And I do not appreciate Disney because of their marketing bonanza and ill-fitting gender stereotypes. But this film is so chock-full of fantasy-killing and misguided ideological messages that I am flabbergasted. It is beyond me how so little viewers find offense with the messages, and that these are thoroughly inappropriate for kids. Like for instance: 1) You are not in control of your emotions, your emotions control you. 2) Thought and reason have no influence at all on your decisions. 3) If you do not keep your emotions in check, you will lose your memories. If you lose your memories, you will become emotionally unresponsive. 4) There is only one good emotion (joy). There are four negative ones (sadness, anger, disgust, fear). That is it. That is what everyone feels. To hell with love. Or desire. Or curiosity. Or faith. 5) In order to grow up, your joyful memories have to become sad memories. Why? Good question. That is the climax of the movie and there is no explanation why this should be the case.None of this makes any sense. The whole plot is completely incoherent. These messages hold no educational value whatsoever. And strangely this seems to be more obvious to children than to adults - I heard a boy asking his parents what any of that was supposed to mean. This is obviously made and marketed for tech-savvy young parents who think they should take their kids to something more "challenging" than "Planes 2". The parents look like what an ad exec at Disney imagines Google employees to look like - mom wears cute specs, dad a hipster beard and it is set in San Francisco on top of that. The whole thing is probably the most in-your-face marketing device posing for a movie that I have ever seen. And everybody seems to be literally buying it.Well, not everybody. Some of the reviewers here do have similar issues, so all is not lost for the human race. If you care for an alternative story about a girl away from home struggling to adapt, there is the fantastic new Ghibli feature "When Marnie was there". That film has everything "Inside Out" has not: a story, believable characters, imagination, mystery, and most importantly: heart.


                
Because the complexity of our brain, Inside Out had to add A LOT of scenes on "how our brain works". Plus, they had to think of how they're going to draw and make it for kids. There was WAY too much going on in this movie and because of that you can't grasp the feeling of it. One scene would be about 5 minutes long and then BAM! you're onto the next one. Solving problems after problems very quickly. The movie wasn't that great. It was more of a drag movie than anything. The characters were awful mainly because they all looked the same in everyone's head. Jokes were typical... Wasn't that funny either, I didn't laugh much. Plus it's the "ugh, that character annoys me so much." type of movie.


                
No. This is not an original idea. It is a done-to-death movie idea. It was done by Herman's Head, by Osmosis Jones, and by almost every "Fantastic Voyage" episode of God only knows how many Saturday morning cartoons.And all of them, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, did it better than Inside Out.First of all, the characters. They are QUITE LITERALLY ONE-DIMENSIONAL. Instead of opting for personifications of complex concepts like the id and the ego or conflicting mindsets idealist, the pragmatist and the narcissist, Pixar chooses to dumb the concept down as much as possible and gives us personified emotions.The setting? Yes, it's beautifully animated, but again: It's nothing we haven't seen done before and done better, both with a better interpretation AND with more humor.The plot? What plot?There is literally not a single original idea in this entire movie. Even the imaginary friend, which should have been where Pixar flexed their creative muscles the most, looks like something they stole out of the Jim Henson Wing of the Puppet Museum.So what does that leave? The countless "Easter egg" references to other Pixar movies. Which, more and more, seem less like things they thought would be fun to throw in and more like an endless barrage of reminders that. . .THIS IS PIXAR AND THAT MEANS YOU STUPID SHEEP ARE SUPPOSED TO LOVE THIS CRAP!!!!And it's that last point that ultimately pisses me off the most, because the sad fact is that they probably don't even need to badger their audiences into thinking this crap is not crap.If any animation company other than Pixar had come out with this crap, it would have tanked at the box office hard enough to close the studio. But because it's Pixar, it's cleaning up at the box office, being lauded over by critic after critic for the "originality" of ideas that were shamelessly stolen, and will very likely walk away with yet another undeserved Oscar for Best Animated Feature.No, this is not a great movie. This is freaking crap. And if we don't call this movie out for the freaking crap that it is and stop giving Pixar money, praise and accolades no matter what kind of crap they give us, we can forget about ever seeing movies anywhere near the same quality as Up, The Incredibles or WALl-E ever again.


                
I can't believe I'm saying this about a movie made by an animation studio I've admired since John Lasseter's first computer animation short "Luxo Jr." back in the '80's.But I had to see this movie from all the positive reviews plus I'm a big Lewis Black fan. But the story amounted to what appeared to be a high end PBS type educational public service announcement about getting to know the workings of the mind and emotions but in the most micromanaged, compartmentalized, explain the obvious so much it distracts from the real story and that being a bit sappy and contrived one at best. "Implied" was not on the screenwriter's mind when they penned this story.I mean I had to struggle keeping track of the differences of short term memory vs long term in the form of glowing orbs distinguished by various colors. I felt like I needed to take notes on the symbols representing stages of childhood emotional growth such as the "goofy" stage. YIKES! Everything that was explained lost its entertainment impact that I was left wondering why or which I should pay attention to, the story? the characters? or how the brain works? I chose none of the above and walked out of the theater.
There have been plenty of cartoon-movies that, even though they weren't geared toward me, at least had something of interest. 'Inside Out' has nothing. Just saw it last night....and not once did anything peak my interest even for a minute. If any man likes this movie, I just wouldn't know what to say.It's just a bunch of emotion-cartoon-characters chasing emotion-balls around inside of the girl's head. Boring, annoying, and extremely childish movie. Sure a very small child might like it. Maybe women like the concept of these battling emotions. But for the average guy....trust me, it's of zero interest. It's not clever. It's very childish and intended for children 8 and under.


                
This movie needs a warning that it is not suitable for those suffering from Depression.I suffer from depression as a result of PTSD. As I felt a darkness coming over me today, I decided I needed to leave the house and thought I would go see a movie to cheer up. Looking at the movies playing at my local cinema, there was a choice of two. I saw a warning about Graphic Violence on "Spy" and decided it would be suitable, but having seen the trailer for "Inside Out" and being a huge Disney fan, I decided to go see it.The movie was so hard on me, my Service Dog spent half the movie trying to pull me out of the theatre. She does that when she feels that my PTSD has been triggered.I have discussed the movie with several other Service Dog handlers, and they have thanked me for the warning, as well as with friends I know suffer from depression, or have family members who do.They MUST put a warning on this movie that it may trigger emotional response in patients with Depression. I am thankful for my Service Dog and support network, because I came out of the movie an emotional disaster. I went to the movies for entertainment because I was feeling down - I never expected a Disney animated movie to throw me further into depression.Please take this into consideration. Someone with less supports than myself could come out of a screening so emotionally depleted they could do themselves harm.


                
I was really looking forward to watching this movie, especially as there's increasingly open dialogue about mental health and psychology these days (yay!), but talk about a let down. I mean, what a let down.Joy is simply annoying. I tried to think that perhaps the character was bossy and pushy to show that happiness always tries to prevail but I just wanted the character to die in that pit of forgetfulness.And that's the best story the filmmakers could come up with? It's like they've run out of imagination! Maybe Pixar's problem is being part of Disney, which can churn out cookie-cutter movie after formulaic movie. I mean, you've got some of the best talent in the world and mountains of money, and yet you can't come up with a friggin' decent story! For this movie, the makers could have made ANYTHING happen in the brain, which is in itself an endless container of possibilities, and yet they chose to have the two main emotions wander around lost in memory storage for most of the movie. Perhaps Imagination Land in the movie represents the imagination of the filmmakers: it's puny and boring - French fries, a house of cards, an imaginary boyfriend. The place looked like some desolate Vegas amusement park about to be shut down. It was depressing.Then we start to see the parents' emotions but only a few times. You either do that consistently or you don't do it at all. And it seems adults would have more emotions than children. Anyway, it doesn't seem to make a difference. As an adult I couldn't be fooled by weakness of this movie, and I imagine kids would be bored and have no idea what's going on anyway.Two stars for visuals!
This, movie is over rated. With a 98% on rotten tomatoes and a 8.4 on IMDb.Well no I cant take this. It's predictable and cliché'. The plot: We begin with Riley being born and joy, in the only emotion (Because we all know when a baby is born they are happy. (NOT)And after a couple of seconds the other emotions come.Before I get into detail.. I want to point out the mistakes and cliché's.Why is the memories in third person. Shouldn't they be in POV?Why is Rileys memories is third person. Shouldn't they be POV? I remember memories in POV, no in third person.... I remember my memories in POV.In the movie Joy and Sadness, are out of HQ( I'll explain the plot later)And while they were there, later on when joy needed to go back to HQ to make Riley happy, the family island falls apart as soon as she needs to go... So cliché' Also in the movie, Joy says"We love our little girl, would could go wrong." And then a sale sign appears, near the house and they are moving. Didn't see that coming.. (not)OK the plot... Is okay.The plot is that sadness touches the core memories and when she touches it; it turns blue (blue is for sadness) and if she touched it for to long, it would be come a sad core memory. And Joy stops her and they get stuck in the tube where the memories go. That meaning that she has no happy feelings..Okay.... The ending is leading to Inside Out 2...At the end Riley is going to her hockey game and Joy says."We love our, girl what could go wrong..."2/10 bad movie I would not watch.
It seems like the message that the writers of "Inside Out" were trying to pass on to its audience (adults and children alike) was "It's OK to feel sad when traumatic events happen in your life." But instead, it came across more as "Feeling optimistic and trying to be happy in the face of adversity isn't realistic and is actually harmful to your mental well-being, Sadness is IMPORTANT and you have to let your Sadness run free when bad things happen." The core concept of the movie-- personifying the emotions that drive us-- is an interesting one, but they run into a major problem. By personifying an emotion like Sadness, you take something that is a tragically everyday part of life, and turn it into a cute green lump with her own personality and emotions. So instead of being an abstract concept that really sucks to experience, Sadness is now somebody you have to root for and cheer on. So when the climax of the movie hits, the film-makers are trying to get you to cheer Sadness on. Go Sadness, we're on your side, feel important and save the day! Meanwhile, Riley, the actual girl, has Sadness take over her mind, corrupting her happy memories that shape her entire personality, and realistically the experience would leave the girl with depression that she has to spend the rest of her life treating. But hey, that green blob get's to feel special for a while, so it's all good, right? Hurrah, kid's movie! Inside Out does have plenty of funny moments, and a solid voice cast, but it is ultimately majorly dragged down by both a script that tries to be deep and insightful but completely bungles the execution, and a story that feels artificially drawn out, making the hour-and-a-half run-time drag at times, making the movie possibly Pixar's worst (though to be fair, I haven't seen either of the Cars movies yet).
I will admit I was done after about an hour and walked out, not even caring enough to get a comp ticket for another film.Is a movie that dwells on looking inside of yourself to find more of yourself what society really needs right now? Aren't we all a little too self-absorbed and a little too much of a production as it is? I don't get the premise, but whatever, if it is funny it is funny... but it isn't funny or cute or quality. Amy Poehler is a bully dressed in pleasantries (as is becoming her typecast), the rest of the cast was much better but the writing was stiff and felt like a bad skit from SNL, the laughs are forced and you really don't care about much other than when it will be done. It tries to be smart and deep but sounds like that person you know who loves to recite facts and news without much else, and you find yourself with the blank half-smile stare you reserve for when JWs are at your door and you forgot to pretend you aren't home.Don't get me wrong, I love animated film done right, I was impressed by "Wreck It Ralph" and "Up" where the voice acting along with the story and writing fit perfectly, this is nothing near those films. If you find "Tom and Jerry" type antics as the pinnacle of animated film, this is the film for you, if you are looking for something both with a strong story and characters and voices to match, skip it and don't believe the high rating.
I don't want to watch it again,, just foolishness and waste of time
Why do people even like this movie. It's boring beyond belief, and it's extremely stupid. Now your probably saying "this dude doesn't like kids movies". Well I actually do. I have watched so much and this one is so well loved that I am just disgusted. I give it a 2 and not a 1 because the animation was good and that's it


                
Call me late to the draw, but this two-year-old film Inside Out has me more upset than its preteen protagonist, Riley.Why was Riley upset? Why am I upset?All of Riley's emotions are purely reactive. They are simply responses to external stimuli, not the least of which are the emotions of her parents. This misplaced emphasis on externals is surprising, given the professed aim of the film: to look at human experience from the inside out."There's absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now," states one emotion mater-of-factly to another.Every experience may be an opportunity for either joy or sadness. But the film makes it look as if we are controlled by emotions, and it is circumstances which control us through our emotional responses to them.Problem with the film: the film conflates joy with happiness and joy with love. These are not the same thing.Another problem with the film: even memories are cast as amenable to reordering, disposal and forgottenness.Our core memories shape our realities, which are presented as simply a reflection of our perceptions accumulated and understood over time. Our personalities are shaped by memories which influence our response to what we perceive as or experiences day-to-day. When Joy and Sadness go missing, everything goes haywire. Personality "Islands" are depicted as unstable; they shake and fall and crash to the ground. Imaginary friends like the elephant-teddy-bear Bing Bong are depicted as ridiculous and incredible.Abstract thought is depicted as imaginary (!!). (So much for the history of human experience, culture and civilization . . .)Ultimately, experiences are depicted as meaningless as soon as they are forgotten.**SPOILER ALERT** Riley, through no fault of her own, is driven to react with anger and run away from home.The entirety of her personality is depicted as responsive and reactive—responsive to the emotions with which she is presented and reactive to the circumstances which she encounters. The idea is that giving Joy an inordinate place is unreality. All emotions are important and therefore to be valued and given an airing.In the end, Sadness DOES have a purpose. She helps Riley (and us) process life.There IS a moral to the story. Rather than trying to "fix" emotions, we should accept them and process them as they present themselves to us. (Perhaps this is why the tireless Joy is presented as a bit of an egocentric.)But if all emotions are equally valuable, why give priority to Joy? And if Joy is not given priority, we are opening ourselves up to a very Sad, Fearful, Angry and Disgusted alternate universe.Perhaps that encapsulates my feelings on the matter. Angry and Disgusted.When the plot resolves, **SPOILER ALERT** it is only by coming to terms with the grief over her childhood hockey disappointments and her imaginary friend Bing Bong's sacrifice through Sadness that Riley's redemption and Joy's return to the Control Center of the brain are made possible. Sadness has a part to play, after all. I do admit that it's okay to feel. I do think that childhood memories play an important part in the formation of personality. And I do value the role of Sadness in the processing of these and other emotions. But I feel less Joy than Anger, less Sadness than Disgust as this film draws to a close. The assumption of the movie that troubles me the most is that emotions are presented as the primary processors of reality. Emotions are all there is. Imagination is nonsensical and problematic. There is no soul beyond the emotions—no reason to speak of. I do appreciate the film for its playfulness, creativity and colour. As a spectacle, it is appealing though not spectacular. And I do like the repetitive running joke about TripleDent gum . . .But this is not a children's movie, not the adventure reel of delightful music and happy endings we have come to know and love. Only Sadness can bring Riley back to feeling. And therein lies a major flaw in the central message of the film—it is on the centrality of circumstance, not emotions, that our final focus is placed. The film ends convincing us less of the validity of emotions than of the pressures of circumstance. Joy does not win; Sadness does. In this sense the film is not a comedy.Nor is it an accurate representation of reality, inside or out.
First time I write a review, but this "movie" has made me to. Only gave 2 for the animation, otherwise, it would have been 1 when considering the enjoy factor it provided. The story is way too boring, the "mind" characters are devastatingly annoying. Not funny enough for a children movie. The message it tries to communicate is overly artificial, contrived and shallow. I terribly regret wasting the time watching it, waiting for it to become better. It was a real pain watching it, in the end. Cannot understand how it has a rating over 8.
