Considered one of the best of Hitchcock's films I find that I'm not that big a fan of the film. Its not that it's a bad movie, rather I think that the film has been ripped off and re-staged so many times that any power the film might have had is rather dissipated. Its kind of like watching Citizen Kane or some other film that is said to have changed the way movies are done and finding that they don't play all that well. The reason is, like North by Northwest that they changed the rules and have been so copied it hard to see what was so revolutionary about them. As it stands now the story of Cary Grant being mistaken for someone else and having to flee from both the police and the bad guys is exciting, especially in its set pieces, but the rest of it isn't anything special and has the feel of been there and done that especially when compared with Hitchcock's other films. Most certainly worth seeing, just be prepared to wonder what all the shouting is about.
`North by Northwest', written by Ernest Lehman and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, stars Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who finds himself embroiled in a particularly nasty case of mistaken identity. He finds himself being mistaken for a gentleman who is wrapped up in some dirty dealings with Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) and various other unsavory thugs under Vandamm's employ.  He also meets up with Hitchcock's requisite blonde femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and surrounded by this cast of characters makes a cross-country adventure where his life is threatened several times; all the while with Thornhill having to depend on his wits to keep him alive.
While `North by Northwest' is a good film, I don't consider it to be one of his best, which, at least in my small circle of rabid film friends/relatives, is fairly sacrilegious.  I enjoy the vibrancy of the script and the lush cinematography, but there are a couple of things that cause the film to fall short of excellence on my personal Hitchcock scale. Mainly, there's the matter of James Mason as the villain.  Mason is a great actor, and has been in some really good films, so his talents were wasted as the tepid Vandamm.  There simply really wasn't a part for him in the film; rather, most of the relatively `juicy' bits were relegated to Martin Landau. It seemed that the concentration was solely on Grant's character, which in most cases is adequate, but in a suspense film, I personally like to see the villain have a more pervasive presence.  Of course, there are some masterful elements to this film.  The infamous cornfield scene is truly masterful.  It isn't even the shot of the crop duster chasing down Grant <U+0096> the image that gets me every time is the very quick shot of Grant standing across the dusty road from the gentleman waiting for the bus.  As he is sizing him up, trying to figure out if he is the man that he has traveled a long distance to see, Hitchcock frames the shot much like a classic western.  There are many shots like this that, if frozen, would make a compelling photograph.  I can also acknowledge, while I am not as much a fan of Hitchcock's comedic moments as I am of the more dark or horrifying ones, that the comic timing with which Grant delivers his lines is excellent.  His charisma certainly adds a spark to the film, and there are times when he is so smooth that even if something was completely unbelievable I had to laugh and say, `Hey, it's Cary Grant <U+0096> what do you expect?'`North by Northwest' was made in 1959 and is more akin to the whimsical and much-eschewed `The Trouble with Harry' than his more story-driven films of the 1940's and his horrifying masterpiece a year later, 1960's, `Psycho'. While I acknowledge that `North by Northwest' is a good film, it doesn't even make my personal `Hitchcock Top Ten' on which his darker films dwell. However, it's kind of the way I feel about the Coen Brothers <U+0096> even a simply `good' film of theirs is usually much better than the average film, so a slightly above-average Hitchcock film like `North by Northwest' garners at least three stars from me.--Shelly


                
WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
One of the better efforts from Alfred Hitchcock, a man who directed extremely well but generally chose substandard material.There's a frightening lack of innovation on display here. There are the usual aerial shots, and some panning upwards, though nothing as groundbreaking as forward zoom/reverse tracking. Though as with Psycho, this is a film that doesn't need any such gimmickry.The humour involved in any Hitchcock endeavour <U+0096> his English sense of detached irony meeting the players' American Vaudevillian <U+0096> jars as usual, though Cary Grant does better than most with some witty lines. It starts almost like a comic version of The Trial, with Grant caught in a fight for his life and with reasons he can't fathom. Things soon touch on vague Vertigo territory, with a "meet a duplicitous woman in a hotel room" sequence. By the end, though, the whole thing has been wrapped up as one of the director's ultimately straightest <U+0096> and therefore most accessible <U+0096> works.Occasionally, the dialogue is a little trite <U+0096> "War is Hell, Mr.Thornhill, even when it's a cold one" <U+0096> though generally the script is quite snappy and sharp for this kind of thing. The shorthand characterisation is exemplified by Grant saying to Eva Marie Saint: "The moment I meet an attractive woman I have to start pretending I have no desire to make love to her." Wouldn't it be great if lines like that worked in real life? They don't, I've tried it. Worst scene is the crushingly bad exposition where the FBI discusses the plot. "Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan, created to divert suspicion from our actual agent." All the people in the room knew about this event, so why does the Professor (Leo G. Carroll, not a good performance) need to describe it, and the elaborate movements for the ruse? Okay, it's to relay the information to the viewers, we all know that, but it's so badly done. The only high point is that before the Professor starts this clumsy dialogue sequence his shoe squeaks on the floor and it sounds like he's just broken wind. Maybe that was Hitchcock's sly comment on the script? The situation is also redeemed slightly by having the Professor later explain the plot to Grant... only to have it drowned out for the viewers by the sound of an aeroplane. The revelation of the microfilm in the statue is also delivered less than plausibly, though this again may be Hitchcock's lazy sense of humour. Avoid the need for screen realism by presenting it as a joke.Yet despite these problems, it still largely stands up, though it's always a shock to see black actors cast only as porters or auction menials. The colour is also washed-out, and the use of filmed and scenic backdrops more than a little obvious. Though mere technicalities shouldn't prevent enjoyment of a reasonably fast-paced plot, and it does contain a passable recreation of Mount Rushmore on it's $4 million budget. This is a film that's over forty years old, after all. The crop duster attack is a sequence that has been ripped off/homaged in more films and television than can be counted, an infamous segment. And of course, the swirling, dizzying theme is brilliant. It's an enjoyable light thriller, but blown up to be hailed as a classic it can only disappoint. 7/10.
I want to say first that I liked this movie. I also have to say that I expected a little bit more from a movie that's considered one of the best ever made, and one of the best (if not THE best by many people) movies ever directed by Alfred Hitchcock. I found it to be an engaging movie, most certainly. It never lost my attention. There was enough going on that I wanted to know how things were going to turn out, and there were even a few situations in which it was impossible to know who's side a particular character was on. All that worked very well for me.I was also impressed by the performances from the three primary leads. Cary Grant was quite good as Roger Thornhill, a New York City businessman who through a case of mistaken identity ends up on the run as apparently Eastern bloc agents try to pull off some sort of scheme (that isn't really revealed until close to the end of the movie.) Thornhill is maybe a little too good at times - your normal businessman who seems to take too readily to the undercover espionage business. But Grant did well as the character. James Mason was the villain Philip Vandamm and was able to offer the perfect combination of menace and charm - just enough to make his character (who could have been quite one dimensional) interesting. And, of course, there had to be a beautiful woman - in this case Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall, who becomes involved with Thornhill but is actually working for Vandamm.I'm not sure that I'd agree that this was Hitchcock's finest performance as a director. He made a movie that was engaging, but not really spellbinding, although he managed to do a good job of gradually building the suspense.Certainly,. this is a very good movie. I'd argue, though, that it's a wee bit over-rated. Still very good, though. (7/10)


                
Alfred Hitchcock's Much-Loved Classic 'North by Northwest' is An Exciting Spy-Thriller that holds tremendous appeal even after decades since its release. Hitchcock's Marvelous Direction, coupled with A Tight Screenplay & Impressive Performances, make this flick worth watching.'North by Northwest' Synopsis: A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive.The only glitch in an other-wise super film, is its lethargic pacing in the latter-hour. While the first-hour keeps you at the edge of your seat, the second-hour gets slow & slightly dull. The climax is well-done, but a sharper & faster second-hour was needed. Ernest Lehman's Screenplay is suspenseful & exciting. Hitchcock's Marvelous Treatment makes 'North by Northwest' so memorable. Cinematography & Art Design are good. Editing isn't sharp enough. Background Score is enchanting.Performance-Wise: Cary Grant is exceptional. He plays the man on the run with a sense of paranoia, which makes his performance unforgettable in many ways. Eva Marie Saint is highly efficient. James Mason is hatable all through. Jessie Royce Landis adds humor & grace to the proceedings with her flawless performance. Leo G. Carroll is effective, while Martin Landau is subtle but evil. On the whole, 'North by Northwest' isn't flawless, but worth watching nevertheless.


                
Cary Grant was certainly an excellent actor, he was able to lead some thrillers without loosing his acting humor, and "North by Northwest" is an example. Interesting that the film starts with the presence of the director Hitchcock in its first scene. Then Cary Grant became for unknown reasons a man (spy) called Kaplan, he was kidnapped at the restaurant and brought to a big house where the punishment was to get him drunk with whiskey and then left driving a car in the evening. I have no intention to give the whole story of the plot, but you may guess that after these first scenes the rest was very much complicated and if you leave the screen you risk to loose the coherence of the film and not to understand all tricky reasons given by Hitchcock. Grant had a good partner in then beautiful Eva Marie Saint, and to a lesser extent from experienced James Mason. If you wish to see an interesting film, I advise you to see this one, another Hitchcock's jewel.


                
North by Northwest, which has horrible translations to French with La mort aux trousses and German with Der unsichtbare Dritte, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movies. This vivid action-thriller and spy epic has influenced franchises like James Bond and many others. Despite a certain nostalgic charm regarding clothes, lifestyles and settings, the movie has aged quite well and is still very entertaining sixty years after its initial release and beyond.The story revolves around a charming advertising executive who is mistaken for a secret agent, kidnapped, poisoned and left for dead. He survives by chance but nobody seems to believe his story and he is instead charged with driving under the influence. The ambitious young man desires to clear his name and starts investigating. Soon enough, he is in the middle of a dangerous conflict between a shady businessman and his associates and the real government agents he has been mistaken for. Along with a mysterious woman who befriends and helps him on a train ride, he travels northwest through the United States of America to figure out what he has been involved with.North by Northwest convinces on numerous levels. The story is twisted, mysterious and dynamic as it will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The iconic action sequences have stood the test of time and are still breathtaking to watch. The unfirgettable locations are chosen with care, intellect and precision. The camera work is very precise and still an example to follow by contemporary standards. The acting performances are charismatic and especially the lead character is truly unique.There are only two minor elements that need to be criticized. The female lead character feels somewhat superficial as she almost instantly falls in love with a perfect stranger despite her pivotal role in the story. Another thing that bothered me was the abrupt ending which could have been a little bit more fluid without overstaying its welcome.Still, North by Northwest is a movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime if you like crime films in general and spy movies in particular.


                
Smashing suspense-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock stars Cary Grant as an ordinary Madison Avenue businessman who is falsely accused of being a spy and a killer, jetting all over the States to solve the tangled mystery. Even when covered with crop-dust, Grant always appears dapper and dry-as-a-martini; both he and this classy adventure hold up extremely well, with Master of Suspense Hitchcock keenly using the patented "wrong man" plot just up to a point. With its amusingly inconsequential title, the screenplay is taut yet clever and droll, and the supporting cast (including James Mason as an icily controlled villain and Martin Landau as a faintly fey henchman) does some fabulous work. Even Eva Marie Saint seems to relax here (she's quite sexy and saucy; her best line--an early one aboard the train about making love on an empty stomach--got dubbed over, which hopefully will be corrected someday). Hitch keeps it all snappy and running smoothly, done with a wink and some sly innuendo. *** from ****


                
Carey grant is really good in this movie. Plays the part really wel. It is funny and entertaining


                
This is, to me, my second favorite Hitchcock movie, next to "Vertigo". Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is kidnapped by two thugs working for a crafty criminal, played by James Mason; Grant is mistaken for purely someone else. He finds himself soon taken with Eve Kendall, a beautiful-yet-cold woman played excellently by Eva Marie Saint, who is a double agent for all practical purposes, working for the CIA(?) and the crafty criminal who must be caught. Grant is his suave self, and Eva Marie Saint is very appealing.Yes, it is easier for him to solve the mystery into which he is unvoluntarily absorbed than to win Eva Kendall's affection. The three settings (New York, Chicago, and Mount Rushmore) contribute to the intrigue of the movie. The climb around Mount Rushmore is tense, though, of course, it is not the real mount itself, just a large, convincing replica. The South Dakota scenery, however, is beautiful, the comical aspects of the movie are entertaining, and the well-constructed a la Alfred Hitchcock plot maintains well the viewers' (viewer's) attention. An outstanding cinematic feat for Mr. Hitchcock.


                
"North by Northwest" is classic 50's Hitchcock straight down the line. An ordinary man in an extraordinary situation; the female character who is not all we think she is; even the "McGuff" turns up eventually.The film, from writer Ernst Lehman, follows the lean Cary Grant from one exciting tight spot to the next as he desperately tries to convince a bunch of would-be assassins that he is not a government agent. Grant is ideal for this average-joe role and he pulls it off well, almost having too much fun. Only Jimmy Stewart could do it better. Eva Marie Saint is reasonable as the femme fatale in question, while James Mason makes for a delicious villain. A young Martin Landau lends malevolent support as one of Mason's henchman.Photographer Robert Burks goes to town with several scenes, especially the brilliant Indiana bus stop showdown. And Mt. Rushmore is perfect for Art Directors Robert Boyle and William A. Horning to display their talents.For purist Hitchcock fans, this is one of his best. The music from Hitchcock regular Bernard Hermann is dramatic.Sunday, October 3, 1998 - Astor Theatre
There are so many iconic elements to North by Northwest, from Bernard Herrmann's complicated score, to the chase scene between Cary Grant and an airplane, to Eva Marie Saint's come-on, "I don't particularly like the book I'm reading," to the location of the end action scene. While everyone has their favorite parts to the movie, mine are not the most famous. My favorite scene is when Cary Grant drunkenly phones his mother from the police station. It's easily the funniest scene in the film, and I happen to adore Cary when he's in his humorous element. My favorite line in the film has become a frequently used household phrase of my family's: James Mason, in one of his iconic villainous roles, smirks at Cary and asks, "Games . . . must we?" in his imitable accent. It's hilarious, and we frequently say, "James . . . must we?" instead when we joke about him or his movies.I don't really like North by Northwest, even though I've seen it over a dozen times. It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films, and everyone in my family really likes it, so it was one of the classics I was raised on as a kid. In general, I find Hitchcock's movies to be a little slow, and I don't think Eva Marie Saint is as appealing as her role necessitates. If it weren't for Cary and James, I'd probably never watch this movie, but their energies together are great fun to watch. They were friends in real life, and when they verbally spar, it almost feels like they're playing a-dare I say it?-game.The plot is always a very intriguing one: an innocent misunderstanding leads certain people to believe Cary Grant has a different name, and he becomes implicated in a very dangerous situation. Since Cary's entirely innocent, it's easy to root for him, but since James is so charming and funny, it's incredibly easy to root for him, too. Aren't the best stories the ones where you're torn between rooting for the bad and good guys? If you think so, you'll probably really like North by Northwest. If you don't end up liking it, then you can ask the screen, "James . . . must we?"


                
Alfred Hitchcock directs "North by Northwest", a loose remake of "The 39 Steps" and "Saboteur", two earlier thrillers by the director. The film opens with a now iconic title sequence by Saul Bass, complete with a pulse pounding Bernard Herrmann score. The angular, diagonal lines of Bass' sequence then transition into a series of bustling New York City shots, followed by the brisk introduction of Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a high flying advertising executive. Opening scenes stress Thronhill's past alcoholism and propensity for lying. This is the film's great "boy who cried wolf" joke: the film's about an untrustworthy advertising executive (who lies for a living) being repeatedly ignored when telling the truth.Hitch started his movie career in 1919, designing graphics and cards for Lasky Studios. After three years as an assistant director he directed his first feature film, "The Pleasure Garden", in Munich Germany. This was a British/German co-production, a collaboration which led to the director slowing absorbing traits from the then burgeoning German Expressionist Movement, a movement which fed off a rise in existential philosophy and various post WW1 crises. Hitch would then direct a series of silent thrillers, in which he slowly evolved his own very distinct style. This style typically mixed a little expressionism with pop modernism, high fashion and early 20th century advertising/graphic design. The demands of silent thrillers also instilled in Hitch a strong sense of pace, cutting and visual economy. At his best his films are clean, sleek and fast, whilst also oozing a gloriously operatic kind of BIG MELODRAMA, which runs almost counter to their machine-like dispassion.These conflicting traits are all found in "North by Northwest". It's at once Hitchcock's most famous thriller, and his longest, most lazily paced. Its at once an expressionist nightmare, and a slapstick popcorn comedy built around Cary Grant's own slapstick past. Its at once a lean silent thriller, and a bloated big budget production. These contrasts lend the film an interesting quality, but would also negatively influence over a century of copycat Hollywood thrillers which trawl for demographics and try madly to be everything to everyone all at once. Every year "Northwest" is released a couple dozen times under a different name, some new running man wrongly accused of something whilst tracking down a McGuffin in an attempt to solve some completely arbitrary problem. In each case the objective is the same: to construct a roller coaster plot which exists solely to facilitate action scenes.Francois Truffaut picked up on this decades ago: "The most appealing aspect of these sequences is that they're totally gratuitous. [...] It's a scene that's been drained of all plausibility or even significance. But it's precisely that gratuity - which you're criticised for - that gives the scene all of its interest and strength. How can anyone object to gratuity when it's so clearly deliberate?" Truffaut's talking about an audacious, drawn-out, near-silent "crop duster sequence" in "Northwest", which Hitchcock elevates to something special. Today, though, with the rise of set-piece cinema, virtually everything's gratuitous. Still, you can't blame Hitch for his children. "Northwest" is itself less dumb action movie than some kind of ornate, pop-modernist artifact; it's more vase than movie. Hitchcock's lines are clean, his colour coordination superb, and everything seems oh so neatly arranged. The film's art director was Robert Boyle, who in collaboration with Hitchcock gave the film its distinct look, with Frank Lloyd Wright houses, some Beaux-Art and lots of early 20th century MidWestern architecture, complete with hipped roofs, horizontal bands and ornamental rock walls. Hitchcock's aesthetic captures a kind of early 20th century American optimism; faith in industry, modernism, technology, slick ergonomics, money, decor, furnishings, top Industrial Designers (Henry Dreyfuss) and finery, even if they thematically say something else.Hitchcock saw "Northwest" primarily as a comedy ("To me it was one big joke. I practise absurdity religiously; I wanted Grant in Lincoln's nostril"), Truffaut as a nightmare, to which Hithcock also agreed ("I'm ill at ease with the ordinary"). But the film's also very very sexy, thanks to screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who wanted to write the "ultimate Hitchcock thriller" and who gives the film lots of risqué banter between Cary Grant and actress Eva Marie Saint.The film goes some interesting places, has some fabulous shots (an overhead, external shot of the United Nations Building kills you) and set pieces, but it's also mostly a bubblegum plot with a now dated finale, stiff/old hero, bad rear-projection, corny jokes and some dull conversations. The film's title is a reference to Shakespeare's "Hamlet": "I am but mad north-north-west," Hamlet says, epitomising Thronhill's own anxieties. Of course no north-northwest exists on the compass. It's a metaphor which implies that Thornhill, like Hamlet, is a little out of tune.Like "The Man Who Knew Too Much", much of the film plays with identities, charades, performances and role playing; everyone's pretending to be someone else, unsure who they or others are and appearances are constantly deceptive. Cold War paranoia – the film's about foreign spies and US counterintelligence – infuses everything, the film portraying rotten government bodies who callously throw lives away and who nurse paranoia at the expense of ordinary civilians. This is all encapsulated by climactic scenes in which our heroes dangle from the stony, uncaring faces of Presidents (a return to the climax of "Saboteur"). As if to punctuate the point, Hitchcock slips into the cast, unbilled, several victims of the blacklist (Joseph Wiseman etc).All of Hitch's films have psycho-sexual weirdness. Here Eva's mid-film betrayal of Thronhill only echoes his own misogynistic past. She turns Thronhill's sarcasm and suspicions back on him, though they do eventually fall in love. Grant's character, incidentally, is constantly being mistaken for a federal agent. He played one in Hitchcock's "Notorious". Maybe that explains it.8/10 - Worth two viewings.
Made 3 years before James Bond made spy movies extremely popular, North by Northwest sometimes comes across as a bit of a caper instead of something more serious, but it has enough going on to keep you interested, even over 136 minutes, a running time few Bond films have exceeded.Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an NY adman who lives a fast and loose lifestyle. When he's mistaken for an enigmatic spy called George Kaplan his is hurled into a partially confusing plot involving cold war traitors, secret agents and double agents. Thornhill travels up and down and across the country trying to outwit his pursuers and find out what the hell is going on, all while romancing Eva Marie Saint, with Bernard Herrmann boisterous score propelling him along.It's another one of Hitchcock's 'wrong man' thrillers, and probably the best (however, I do rate Saboteur highly). But it IS still a bit overrated. It's shot very well, in many different locations, and there's little, if anything, to dislike about it. But like many early Bond movies there are many scenes where you can easily tell that the characters are just walking on a treadmill with a rear-projection behind them instead of physically being in actual locations. It doesn't spoil anything, though it is always noticeable.


                
It's interesting for a younger generation to watch movies such as "North by Northwest" to see just how much recent movies rip off original ideas."North by Northwest" is a spectacular suspense movie (I would not classify it as a thriller or action), with a keen script and even keener delivery of the lines. Cary Grant is commanding in his role as a fugitive from the law, while Eva Marie Grant is captivating as the femme fatale.I did have my problems with the film. As with most movies of the period, it dragged on at points. While Grant and Saint have a nice on-screen chemistry, Hitchcock at times dwells too much on the duo and not enough on the intriguing storyline.Plus, the movie has unnecessary exposition. There is a lot of emphasis on making the viewer realize Grant's character is a fast-thinking businessman at the opening of the movie, but the story never gets back to that. Grant's character never really has the chance to evolve, he just simply changes.But overall, this movie triumphs because of the pace at which the viewer learns interesting details. Unlike most current Hollywood flicks in which the viewer has to wait until the end to learn anything (and the rest of the movie is spent trying to guess its secrets), "North by Northwest" lays down all its cards well before the movie's climax. The result is a story that is interesting throughout the entire film, as well as proof of Hitchcock's genius in direction.


                
This movie was very interesting! The adventure was very thrilling. Trying to find who Mr. Kaplan was and why they wanted him had me at the edge of my seat. Hitchcocks odd use of color made the screen pop with color for example the taxi. The use of the different shots and angles show a little bit more of the directors technique and letting the audience infer more about the film. Some techniques were very clever for example using a painting instead of the real house and a treadmill for people who were walking. It had you on your toes and laughing at the same time. And the scenes the director choose had meaning to it even if it seemed so simple like the ending. The film was great and worth watching.
This is one of the best thriller movies I have ever seen. Hitchcock has succeeded again in creating suspense and thrills for everyone to enjoy. The film is mainly about a advertising man who is mistaken for a government agent and is relentlessly chased around the world. Apparently the Oscars liked the film considering it gave it three nominations. I can see why this film is regarded as Hitchcock's best work. The only problem I have with this film is the abrupt ending, thinking it would be climatic it changes to a completely different location and it ruins the suspense for me. If you are going to have suspense and thrills throughout the film, don't ruin the ending by having it change and completely destroy the suspense that it builds.


                
Number 24 in the list of top movies! An advertising agent Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a non-existent and virtual government agent George Kaplan and chased around the country by agents and he finds ways to survive them all with a bit of humor and an affair with another mysterious agent Eva Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).This Alfred Hitchcock movie has the typical stamp of all Alfred Hitchcock movies. It is fast paced, it is set in urban areas, it has mystery and suspense, it has good humor and it has some good sets.Some scenes are memorable, the first when Alfred makes his cameo in the beginning of the movie when he misses catching a city bus, the glider plane scene that comes to attack Cary Grant, and the final action against the backdrop of Statues of Great American Presidents. All of them make great viewing. I could imagine with Hitchcock and Cary in their prime popularity would have raked great reviews when the movie would had been released.Today, after 48 years <U+0096> the movie still remains watch-able, pleasant, and over-all a good cinematic experience; but surely it does not give the same amount of classic mastery feel that some other Hitchcockian movies has.The drunken driving scene of Cary Grant is so poorly executed with Cary overacting to the hilt of affairs and looks so artificial, un-natural and over-dramatic. Otherwise Cary Grant has charming personality. Seeing Eva Marie Saint reminded me of Julia Roberts <U+0096> Julia Roberts rise to fame must have to do with the type of looks she has <U+0096> typical American Hollywood heroines.The music as in all Hitchcock movie is very Jazz and Mozart type <U+0096> especially in chase and action scenes.A good movie, but I won't agree it being a great classic by the master.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)


                
North by northwest is the 5th Hitchcock movie that i've seen,and knowing it's in the top 100 of the best movies ever made,i've had really high expectations..well i wasn't disappointed but i admit that it wasn't what i expected.the direction and visuals are grandiose,the camera angles and the photography,simply beautiful,especially the mount Rushmore final confrontation. But it lacks Hitchcock's taste of macabre,human satire and depth but that's mainly due to the fact that North b n was intended to be different from the earlier Hitchcock movies by having more action and less mystery and drama.this formula pleased the audiences back then but i believe that this is NOT Hitchcock's masterpiece,it has none of that subtle haunting mystery of vertigo,psycho...eva marie saint has a really great character,while cary grant can be annoying sometimes...North by northwest is more like a commercial blockbuster that's really enjoyable to watch but doesn't really linger in ur mind forever...


                
Let's get one thing straight: this film is tremendous fun.  Don't lose sight of this fact because of anything I say.  It's fun ALL THE WAY THROUGH, even when it creaks.  Moreover I can see some of the things that lead people to the ridiculous conclusion that it's a masterpiece.  Several scenes are classics in miniature - I can't really say which ones, but I suppose you already know about the crop duster sequence - then there's the priceless line Cary Grant delivers as he runs to the aeroplane on the slopes of Mt. Rushmore, so carefully led up to - and Bernard Herrmann's score is brilliant.And yet ...That damned Eve Kendall: SHE'S the McGuffin, not the "government secrets" the baddies are trying to smuggle out of the country.  (Clearly the film wants us to think she's so much more important than they are; but if it refuses to tell us what the villains want and why, how are we in any position to make a comparison?  Hitchcock's McGuffin theory led him astray here, I fear.)  The heroine of "North by Northwest" can't hold a candle to her vibrant counterpart in the original cross-country Hitchcock, "The 39 Steps" (1935).  Watch the original to see what's missing from the remake. The later film has a tendency, just a tendency, to fall asleep on its feet: it needed more poetry in its quest, more humanity in its hero, more vigour in its man hunt, less tedium in its exposition.  If I didn't know better - if I hadn't seen "Vertigo", released the previous year, or "Psycho", from the subsequent one - I'd say Hitch had ossified.


                
Just finished watching Hitchcock's "Signature Collection" which comprised: Strangers on a Train / North by Northwest / Dial M for Murder / Foreign Correspondent / Suspicion / The Wrong Man / Stage Fright / I Confess / Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Knowing that North by Northwest was the highest rated movie of the lot, I save the "best" for last.I was a little disappointed as I thought the plot, while probably original for it's time, seemed quite ordinary by today's standards. However, the strongest suit of this film is the artistic quality. Hitchcock does an extraordinary job. The camera work is fantastic, the backgrounds are stunning, and the color schemes are beautiful.I watched this movie twice. The first time I rated it a six and this time a seven. I understood it better the second time but still couldn't help notice holes in the plot. I still couldn't understand Thornhill's obsession with Eve, even though she almost got him killed by directing him to the cornfields. And I couldn't determine what was the purpose of the microfilm that fell out at the end.The villains play a confusing role in this film. I actually had to read other posters comments in order to figure out why the villains wanted Thornhill so bad.There are also some obvious continuity errors. For example, the movie starts off in New York City. Yet in the car chase we see sharp jagged mountains right next to the coast. The setting looked more like the West Coast than NYC.
When he went to Hollywood, Alfred Hitchcock made the movie Rebecca, which cost just over $ 1 million, and had a good box office run. Alfred Hitchcock just wanted to sell a ticket for the people to enjoy a good movie in a good section. After Rebecca, Mr. & Mrs. Smith also had success with the public, however it was with Strangers on a Train, Dial M for Murder, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo and obviously Rear Window that Hitchcock had its biggest hits in his Hollywood career until the mid-50's. With that Alfred Hitchcock gained a lot of strength within Hollywood, and he got a big budget for this movie, North by Northwest. North by Northwest was another commercial project that Alfred Hitchcock embraced in focus in the espionage. North by Northwest was successful at the box office, but it was not on the same wavelength as his previous projects, which I mentioned here, especially Rear Window, and the film did little more than double its own budget. So Alfred Hitchcock returned to Psycho on a more modest budget.North by Northwest, it's a good movie. It has a good suspense, the direction is very good by Alfred Hitchcock, and the performances are solid, especially Eva Marie Saint, who is perfect here. The great sin of this movie, for me, are the characters of this movie. Considering the important ideas and techniques that Alfred Hitchcock developed that could fill some books. I always expected more from this project. The problem with this film is how some of these characters were written, in this department I particularly blame Ernest Lehman. Ernest Lehman, wrote the characters in an amateur way, in which these same characters do not look anything like humans when confronted with the same situations that appear in the film. Particularly the scene with the mother of the main character, when she confronts one of the "supposed" hijackers in an elevator. From this moment, I completely lost the notion of a film with a serious focus. And to be honest, the characters surround the comedy tone many times and in many situations, particularly in some situations with the main character at a mid-train station. From that moment, I completely lost interest in this film, and I just went to look at the movie just to pass the time. And waiting for the movie to end. For a film that wanted to be serious, and this was its initial proposal with the public, the movie was loses much coherence as a film. It was a disappointment, for me.


                
The "old" movies in the Top-250 seem to me to fall squarely into two categories: true classics (Vertigo, Casablanca), and movies that are probably mostly included for nostalgic reasons and have aged quite noticeably. "North by Northwest" falls clearly into the second category. While it's by no means a bad movie, it's also by no means a real classic."North by Northwest" can best be described as a very early attempt at an action comedy. It's a fast-paced, fairly light story that clearly goes for style over substance. As such, it succeeds gloriously. There's no denying that it's a very charming movie. The lead characters are excellent, the dialog is sharp, witty, and full of memorably quotes, and some scenes like the auction are truly classic. Kudos also to the excellent musical score.Yet, I was expecting a bit more from Hitchcock. For one, "North by Northwest" is sorely lacking in suspense. Although the main characters are constantly chased and put into supposedly hazardous situations, but they always get away easily and never seem to be in any real danger, thus killing most of the suspense.The plot also doesn't really help. It's got its fair share of twists and turns, but most of them are so predictable that you can spot them from a mile away, and curiously enough most of the mystery is revealed early on, further killing any suspense that might have been there. Also, expect a fair amount of plot holes, contrivances, and a very clear deus ex machina ending. The relatively complexity of the plot might have wowed audiences one day, but not any more."North by Northwest" is perfect as a light-hearted diversion, but I have trouble seeing this as the classic it is often proclaimed to be.***1/2 out of *****
This one was good! I liked it a lot and it has a ton of charm. However, I feel like its reputation made me not like it quite as much. But that tends to happen with classics for me.


                
When it comes to Alfred Hitchcock pictures, his "MacGuffin" plot style is quite a bit overused (especially by today's standards). "North By Northwest" contains that same style of film-making. However, this film is so well-constructed otherwise that it still holds up well over time.For a basic plot summary, "North by Northwest" follows the exploits of one Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), who is mistaken for another man and happens to fall into a Cold War spy ring led by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Along the way, Thornhill is romanced (and does a fair share of the romancing) by Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose character may not be exactly who she seems.In terms of plot, this is one of Hitchcock's best...if only for the first half of the film when the mystery of "Thornhill/Kaplan" is still brewing. Once the truth is disclosed, however, the MacGuffin quickly becomes apparent and kind of turns the movie into a simply spy tale (and thus it loses a little luster).The acting is terrific, as Hitch makes the "bad guys" genuinely creepy (I mean, Martin Landau's face alone is enough to do that!) and showcases Grant & Saint throughout.Bernard Hermann's soundtrack also deserves a good chunk of the credit for keeping the latter portions of this movie interesting, as those famous Hermann strings refuse to let viewers relax even for a moment during the climactic moments.Overall, "North by Northwest" is a very good Hitchcock effort that deserves watching by any fan of the director or just cinema buffs in general. A 3.5 ranking would be my exact choice, but because of it being so well-made, I bump it up to four stars.
