 A stylish and excellent example of expert story-telling.

 Edgy, engrossing and still holds up well as a heist film over the years

 Best Tarantino-film

 Fun, amusing, and creative but doesn't really lead up to anything like it wants you to believe.

 Reservoir Dogs is loud, bloody and constantly in your face.

 Funny, cool, vulgar, violent... Tarantino's best!

 Hardened criminals on parade

 Larry, stop pointing that f****** gun at my Dad!

 This Little Doggie Bites

 99 minutes of no nonsense stuff

 A bloody mess of a great early quintessential Quentin film

 Intelligent, engaging, bold and invigorating; a great debut

 Tarantino's Only Interesting Movie

 Crash-bang-whalop from a director with something spanking new to offer.

 A Crazy, Good Movie

 Fan Favorite, Not Mine Necessarily

 The Lucky Strike

 "Are you gonna bark all day little doggy, or are you gonna bite?"

 The beauty in the simplicity of a gangster movie. By Quentin Tarantino.

 Timeless and Gripping

 An incredible debut from Tarantino

 Tarantinos Humble Beginnings

 Ultra-violent blood-fest

 "Now listen up... There's two ways we can do this job. My way or the highway!"

 Great Fun Watching Tarantino's First Effort
