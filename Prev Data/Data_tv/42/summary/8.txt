 Two very different seasons

 Nostalgia shouldn't drive a story...

 A multi-genre masterpiece by The Duffer Brothers.

 Horror filled with Nostalgia

 80's Menagerie

 I watched all 8 episodes in one big binge

 Oh, my childhood...

 A Strangely Great Sequel

 Never judge a book by its cover.

 Sequel done right

 Excellent, lacks punch on a few occasions

 Tween Peaks meets Silent Hill

 Nicely recaptures that spooky 80's feeling

 Clever 80's SciFI show that has taken the world by storm

 Great 80s Throwback campy horror genre Poltergeist meets Freddy

 A real tasty love potion

 The Music...

 Stephen King and Throwbacks: The Series

 Love it but overrated

 One to another

 Pop Culture Thoughts - Season 2

 Easily the best Netflix Original

 In it's context, brilliant. Overall, not that much.

 My god I wanted this to be a 10

 Worth watching even if you're not into sci-fi
