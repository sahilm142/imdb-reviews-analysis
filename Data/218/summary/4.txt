 It could had been much much better

 David Yates ruined the movie

 Not half as good as expected

 Deus Ex Machina - Shameful, fans deserve better

 Harry Potter and a Scripting Shallow Part 2

 Poor Adaptation

 Falls victim to the same missteps that have always plagued this series.

 J. K. Rowling is a masterful storyteller. The makers of this movie are not.

 It was just the best way of spoiling such an amazing novel

 finally this boring series is over

 Good, but not good enough
