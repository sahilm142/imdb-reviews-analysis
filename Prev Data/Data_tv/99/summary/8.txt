 The Best Star Trek series

 Hit and miss

 Intriguing, but not necessarily wowing

 A mixed bag, but good on the whole.

 Pioneers

 It's good, but it does not beat the first series.

 My favorite Star Trek Series

 This is when I got my crush on Patrick Stewart

 Occasionally too cerebral but generally exceptional.

 worthy continuation

 Certainly the most fun to watch among the Star Trek series

 Less pride and charging in, as the reins are handed over to a Brit with a French name

 Gene Roddenberry hits the spot again

 The many faces of Captain Picard

 A Visceral Sci-Fi Adventure.

 I have to tell you this in my update.
