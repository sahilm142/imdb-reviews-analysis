First of all, this movie needs editing -- at least 30 minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Secondly, the completely white subtitles (without any shadowing) were very hard to read in some of the scenes.  Lastly, the level of blood was gratuitous.With some good editing and better subtitles, I might give it a 6 or 7, but as it was released in the US, it only rates a 3 or 4 out of 10.
