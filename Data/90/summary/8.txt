 One of the first animations from Pixar

 Toy Story

 Toys Speaking

 Great Fun For Kids And Adults Alike

 Classic

 Pixar's Best!

 A born classic.. nouveau. But why R. Lee Ermey?

 In my top 25

 definitely a classic

 Hanks and Allen are hilarious even animated!

 Despite the Disney conventions, a very entertaining film.

 Entertaining, but watch out for part two!
