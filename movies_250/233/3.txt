Groundhog Day, it's a movie we watched in film appreciation class. I personally think movies should contain certain theme and messages that we can observe. However, this movie's theme is not clear for me, and do not know what messages the director wants to give to the audiences. There were some few laughing points that entertained me, but it was more like a B class comedy film.
