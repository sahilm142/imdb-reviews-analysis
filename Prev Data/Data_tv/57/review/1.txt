I admit, that I was young boy, age 15 when I watched BLACKADDER GOES FORTH. At that age, I found it very funny and great. But, I didn't know at that age what really was WWI. Shame on me.But the fresh start of this trend to spit on ourselves began in 1982 with Allo Allo TV Series (when we all Laughing loud to all heroes, victims, dead, invalids and raped women of WW2).Anyone who lost someone in WW1 or WW2 should not laugh on suffering and pain of all who participate in this wars. First, any war, especially WW1 and WW2 are everything but NOT comic and funny. I am afraid that people already forgot how frightful and disaster were those two world wars, how many people died... And for what they died. To be laugh? To made comedy about heroism and sacrifice? Did any soldier gave his or her life for nothing? Just ti be disaster today?? When I see today how rated are this 2 (noncence TV series) 8,9 and 8,4 I think they all died for nothing, for OBLIVION. I will put now by side WHY this 2 TV series did not made Germans or Austrians or Hungarians. I respect them because they got dignity and the respect their casualties of war, their victims, their soldiers. GER, AUT, HUN, JAP maybe lost the war BUT they did not lost the brain. Let me ask You, all of you, my dear friends from IMDb one simple question: What ordinary people will realize when they watched this Blackadder Goes Four (1989) shall we say 100,200, 300 years from now? This is opposite of my feelings and respect which I have to Allied Armies (UK, AUS, FRA, USA, SRB, GRE,... and all others). Ordinary man in 2115 or 2215 or 2315 (for example) WILL SEE British SOLDIER in 1914-1918 as: stupid, brainwash, sheep for slaughterhouse, moron who follows every order and die for nothing, naive soldier who don't understand why is he at the front, for what purpose. British officers will be seen 100, 200, 300 years after today like: cowards, chair warmers, madmen who loves to sent their British soldier to guaranteed death. The truth is very simple: many officers died side by side with their soldiers. They attacked together, they died together. The fought for our better future, for liberty, for free Europe, for EU today we got. I am proud that British, French, Serbian and Greek soldiers fought together at Thessaloniki border line in Nort Greece. And They break through front line in 14. Sep 1918. On 30.September Bulgaria drop weapons and capitulate. On 26.October Turkey capitulate. This front is also known as Macedonian or Salonica front line. Center Power were GER and BUL army versus UNITED KINGDOM or GREAT Britain army, France, Greek and Serbian forces with also some ITA and RUS forces. 50.000 Alied soldiers gave their lives, 60.000 Central power soldiers were killed or captured! Did they fight and died to be laugh by us in 1989 or 1999 or 2015 or anytime??? WAR is not COMEDY. War is blood, death, poor, sorrow, sadness, lost, broken lives and destroyed families. War is definitely what we saw in Blackadder 4 or Allo Allo. If you ever come to Tessaloniki PLESE visit (Allied Military Cemetery) Zeitenlik. 7.565 Serbian, 8.000 French, 3.000 Italians, 2.000 British soldiers and 400 Russian soldiers died in Macedonian Front. Is anybody laughing now? Any funny? Are you enjoy in comedy?
