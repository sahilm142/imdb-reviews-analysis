 Sluggish supernatural mystery.

 Overrated

 Didn't work for me

 The Spoiler is Willis!

 Avoidable and highly predictable!

 Lovely film but weak plot

 Disappointing

 If you can't guess the "twist" before the end ...

 A weak foundation.

 You'll just like the end, but the rest...

 Not worth the hype

 Golly gee, we sheep should praise M. Night for being unoriginal

 I see dull people.

 Good Movie undermined by a colossally bad ending

 Popular but not excellent

 Predictable and drawn out

 please

 I See Dumb People

 Paranormal Mystery

 Embarrassing, yet surprisingly dull

 I really, really tried to like this movie.

 Silly Slickness

 a waste of time

 What's the big deal? (This review may contain some spoliers)

 Clever manipulation.
