The comments for "Pulp Fiction" generally fall into one of three categories: 1) "Awesome Dude! The best movie ever!" raves that offer zero supporting analysis, apparently written by Gen-Y homeboy wanna-bes raised on "Friday the 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" sequels; 2) more considered, thoughtful raves praising the unconventional structure and 'hip' dialogue; 3) absolute horror that such violent, profane trash was ever made in the first place. I am much closer to #3 than the other two.
I had read about "Reservoir Dogs" (but not seen it) when "Pulp" was released. I went to see this with an open mind, before all the hype erupted. I almost walked out during the Gimp scene. I found this movie impossible to enjoy, because it seemed to revel in sadism, profanity, and cruelty, and I could find not one character to identify with. The whole film was simply unpleasant and repulsive - I just cannot find humor in graphic, casual murder. "Apocalypse Now" and "Seven" are favorite films of mine, so I do not buy the 'go back to Mary Poppins' routine from many of the defenders of "Pulp". I think the audience (and possibly Tarantino himself) simply gets off on seeing people like this go about their business - it is a vicarious thrill. I have known some lowlifes in the real world, and it is most decidedly NOT fun. What genuinely scares me about the overwhelming praise that "Pulp Fiction" has received from critics and viewers is that there is zero empathy for the various victims of violence in this movie - they are regarded as mere props, not human beings.***SPOILERS*** One thing that has always bugged me, story-wise, is the scene in Butch's apartment with Vega. It makes no sense that a guy who is a professional killer would leave his weapon in plain sight, out of his reach, while he 'relieves himself'. I do not care how whacked out he is, in hostile territory he simply would never do that.***END SPOILERS***Everyone who praises Tarantino as the greatest filmmaker of a new generation - educate yourself a little about film. The overlapping storyline thing is nothing new ("Rashomon"), neither is using scatological monologues and non-stop profanity in place of actual dialogue ("Scarface", for one). Let Tarantino write or direct something where the characters' primary means for self-expression is not gunfire, then we can talk.
It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesn't work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isn't.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He "played" a dance, which isn't the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesn't dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isn't a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys aren't just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isn't like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didn't have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesn't last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isn't a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece don't know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they don't really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip.


                
The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema!


                
I have watched 75% percent of this film twice: the first time, I watched it on TV, and about 3 quarters of the way, I gave up... However, due to the film's cult following, I gave it another shot (and watched it to the end) and, to be honest, I didn't like it anymore than I did the first time I watched it...Why is that?First of all, it was utterly chaotic for the most part. It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didn't like at all...Then there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantino's films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...Moreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldn't be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...Lastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...I only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasn't the actors that disappointed me, but the film's script...So, the verdict:It might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems I'm one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction...


                
Pulp Fiction is the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Reservior Dogs had released and was the talk of the town. Average movie that talks a lot and is set in mainly one place. Pulp Fiction is another movie that talks a lot, and doesn't do much else. It is a 2 in a half hour long movie and calls itself a action gangster movie. There is hardly any violence in this movie, its just talking talking and more talking. No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare. This is more of a comedy gangster related movie like Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. That was funny.


                
What is the people's problem with crime, blood, narcotics? Even they mostly hate it, they like watching as I understand from the rate of this movie. The art of telling disgusting things? Oh my God. I found this movie overrated and do not recommend anyone to watch. Watch boxing or something else bloody.


                
No, this film did not repulse me as much as reservoir dogs did. That's among the best things I can say about this movie. The fact that so many people seem to love it so much is actually frightening to me. I just can't seem to understand the desire to see this director's shock value material. What is the fascination with seeing ears cut off or needles jammed into people? I sat through it and must admit there were some positive things worthy of note. I did laugh at some scenes and John Travolta's performance was his only good one since the 70s. My 3 pts out of 10 are for: 1)Samuel Jackson with the hamburger 2)the absolutely ridiculous story by Christopher Walken and 3) the absurdity of Keitel coming in to clean up the mess. All in all, excrutiating, but as I say a step up from the first film by Tarantino.


                
Movies can either entertain or edify; ideally, they do both. Pulp Fiction failed to entertain me. Perhaps that's just me. I grant it's funny in places, but I couldn't manage laughter in the middle of a homosexual rape, a gangland hit, a drug overdose, a kid getting his head blown off, etc. I suppose I must be abnormal in some way.Does it edify? It makes many references to other films; I don't think that counts. It shows us (several times) how crucial timing can be in visiting the restroom. No, I don't think that's it either. Some say it's about the "redemption" of the Jackson and Willis characters. Whatever redemption may have taken place seems very superficial and unconvincing.On the positive side, several of the performances were brilliant. The screenplay is undeniably clever. But that's not enough to make me want to recommend this movie to someone.


                
in the wake of his awesome debut, Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino could have served up just about anything and it would have been hailed as a masterpiece by all those keen to jump on the bandwagon. he, sadly, did just serve up anything.on your first viewing, Pulp Fiction does take your breath and look stunning. if you want to join the masses and celebrate this film blindly, you may then want to avoid the rest of this review and never watch the film more than once.if you be generous enough to let the flimsy, contrived plot threads go by you, the real problem here is what the film was oddly celebrated for - the bad writing and the lousy dialog that shall forever haunt this film. sure, there are one or two smart one-liners, but the problem is that each and every character in this film talks, acts and behaves the same. the lengthy speech given by Christopher Walken, for instance, is the same in tone and content as anything that Samuel L Jackson would say, and likewise Sam just talks like Uma Thurman, who talk like Bruce Willis, who talks like John Travolta, etc, etc ad nauseum.this, and the subsequent, poorer films he made, revealed Tarantino to be a confidence trickster, a, if you will, one trick pony. what a shame, he looked like he had so much talent and potential.be brave, do not just follow the crowd and the masses - see this badly written home movie for the low grade, half-dimensional nonsense that it is!!


                
One of the few movies I have ever seen that made me feel soiled and pistol whipped.  Although the non-linear story line is indeed an interesting concept Tarantino becomes so absorbed in showing us society's underbelly he leaves us with a hopeless mess of a film.  The violence is a study in wretched excess, involving careless murders, drug use, kidnapping and rape. There isn't even a single character worth understanding or identifying with. I ended up hoping everyone, including Tarantino, would die at the end of this film.  Unfulfilling garbage.


                
I just had to take a minute and comment on this film. I think it was shockingly bad. I really like Tarantino's other films/True Romance is a masterpiece. then he goes and makes this disjointed piece of crap? I guess people get bored telling a good, simple story like. Uma Thurman stole every scene she was in. John Travolta was revolting and I was embarrassed for him trying so hard to act so cool throughout this thing. give me a break!! the whole thing with the rape defines gratuitous violence for the sake of what? trying to prove how tough someone can be? yeah, OK. the whole movie had this trying-desperately-hard-to-be-ultra-cool. all I can say is this film is OVERKILL in a big way. some scenes are OK but most of it should have been scraped. that people like this film as much as they do is a sad commentary on good film making and what people now a days will call brilliant. it's all a.d.d./mtv-pandering to those with the attention span of a gnat.


                
When I was finally going to see this movie for the first time, I was really excited because of all the good things that I had heard about it. When I got halfway through it, I found myself staring at the ceiling, wondering why it is so important to listen to people discuss pot bellies and the french way to say quarter pounder. I think there were some good scenes and some great one-liners, but the movie could have been at least 45 minutes shorter and had a story line that at least made a little bit of sense before you have to sit through it again just to piece together story. Overall, the idea for the story is OK, but the execution was off. I can see why a lot of people like it, but I think those people have too much time on their hands and need to start thinking about things like why we have a moron president instead of the relevance of a foot massage to shooting Marvin in the face.


                
This movie has not stood the test of time it has been copied, and resold to us too many times over the years, aside from a few good quotes the story is emotionless, with no depth to speak of, if you like watching something without getting anything from it besides racial and homophobic jokes this movie is for you


                
Three things I hated about this movie:1) The pointless and irritating dialogues - "in France they call it Royal". Yes, so McDonald's has different names for the quarter pounder in different countries. Great. Am I as a viewer supposed to find this fact surprising? or witty? or "cool"? or what? In fact, the whole conversation about McDonald's was just dead boring. As were the conversations about drugs. "Whos's motorbike is this? - It's not a motorbike, it's a scooter" just made me want to punch that pedantic cretin.2) The gimp. Quentin Tarantino's prejudices aren't doing any favours to reputation the BDSM and gay communities. Most people who are into bondage aren't sickos, and I think propagating myths about BDSM is irresponsible. Oh, and of course, black people aren't into fetish. Ever. Everyone knows that, right?3) The dance. Not making any effort and just not generally giving a toss won't earn you a prize in real life.
Over the last 3 years, I have seen over 100 movies per year. I finally got around to seeing Pulp Fiction. This movie was very slow for most of the movie, had very weak plots, and was not entertaining. It was also very violent, so parents should think twice about letting their children see this movie. If you are one of the many people who fall into the trap of liking a movie because it is 'different', then maybe you'll like this movie. For everyone else, I recommend skipping this movie!!! It was a waste of 2 hours and 45 minutes.


                
This film got me so hyped, everyone kept telling me how great it was, and how I need to watch it. And boy was I let down. Although not terrible in itself, I REALLY cannot see the 'genius' film writing that everyone seems to think this film has.There was no plot line worth mentioning, sure there were lots of different strands which interconnect at the end, but none of the plot lines actually went anywhere; which is awful since you spend half the film with crossed fingers, hoping they do.Sure, this may be the reason people rate it so high. I can see the movie critics with phd's in 'film studies' crying out 'it start where it begun, THE GENIUS!' but in all honestly this film has a delivers a similar viewing experience as listening to the first lord of the rings book on shuffle gives.-Long -Slow -Boring -Nothing really happens
I saw this movie when it was first released and I still don't understand how so many people love this movie.  Travolta is nothing special, Bruce Willis was a stiff, and the whole concept of this movie seemed ridiculous to me. Sam Jackson was great as playing a typical Sam Jackson Role. I think everyone was on a Tarantino rush because he wore those kangol hats. Who Cares!!? Reservoir Dogs wasn't good either.  Maybe I'm just anti tarantino but in no way is this one of the greatest films of all time or even the 1990's.


                
OK. I'm certainly not going to bother to waste my time, or yours, here by ranting and raving away about what a frickin' over-rated (that's right - OVER-RATED!) picture that I, most definitely, think that Pulp Fiction is.All that I'll say on the matter is that I have never, ever heard so many stupid conversations going on (on a continual basis) as I have heard going on in this film, bar none. It's true.And out of all of these brain-dead conversations that took place the most brilliant "factoid" brought to my attention was that in France, at their McDonalds, they actually (get this!) put mayonnaise on their french fries.(Gasp!) Oh-me! Oh-my! Those uncouth, bohemian, Parisian parasites have no class at all! Uh.... Need I say more?


                
An overrated film with tons of drugs, sex and cussing. It has a 9 while movies like the LOTR series has 8s and so do most of the movies on the top 250 proving that IMDb is full of fanboys/girls.People think this movie is funny because he says "Royal with cheese" DERRR HAHAHA SO FUNNY OMG, OH AND THAT ONE PART WHERE THAT BLACK GUY CUSSES A WHOLE BUNCH IS SO FUNNY TOO.The only cool part is when he chooses the samurai sword over the chainsaw.Dumb, full of trash and I regretted seeing it, if you wanna be in the know with all your dumb friends then give it a look you will be disappointed.


                
I spent 2 and a half hours of watching this. I like violent crime movies like this one. I've heard that this is the best movie of 90s but i don't agree with that. This movie, compared to "Godfather" is 0/10.It has no logic and no sense, and ending is so stupid. Maybe actors are acting great, but in a wrong movie. I expected something more of Tarantino. Also the way character played by Bruce Willis kills Vincent is stupid.
This movie seems to be lived because of its disparate events. I found those things to be a turn off because i did not feel attached to any of the characters. The movies main entertainment is the broad use of profanity which lowers my regard for the writing.


                
OK, there are good scenes in this film...mainly the ones Willis or Keitel in them, but overall the following gripes I have with this film make me unable to enjoy it.1) Why does it not just run chronologically? Its clearly just a pointless gimmick that adds nothing to our enjoyment or understanding of the story.2) Pulp Fiction is just a vehicle, like most his other films, for Tarantino to write out his geeky fantasies. And why does he cast himself in his films he's a hideous actor.3) The dialogue. Does everyone always have to be so super cool? Its completely unnatural. The whole style of the film actually irritates me greatly in some sub-conscience was that I cant quite articulate.I write this as I was on Keitels IMDB page and viewed his films as rated by members and almost keeled over in disbelife to see that this geek-fest is rated above Taxi Driver...really, I just dont know anymore. lol. :)


                
1994 was an interesting film year, in that it produced two of the most highly lauded films in recent memory -- Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump -- which, in my humble opinion, are both grossly overrated. I'm not sure I could say Pulp Fiction is the worse of the two, but it's certainly the more disappointing.The reason for this is that Quentin Tarantino's script demonstrates his flair for hip, knowing dialogue, and his ability to use such dialogue to take the edge off violence (a good or bad thing, depending upon your views). The problem is that, rather than use this gift to create characters in whom you are actually interested in following, Tarantino instead opts for the equivalent of writing and directorial masturbation -- i.e., showing what he can do merely for the purpose of showing that he can do it, without any real concern for character or plot. Such an approach may be call for praise from critics and devotees, but for me they are a grievously missed opportunity. Indeed, what was wildly praised as ingenious film-making (i.e., through the non-linear and looping time order of the scenes) instead smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character.As for the highly lauded performances, only three really stand out for me, and two -- Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken -- in glorified cameos. The only other truly developed character is that of Samuel L. Jackson, whose character discovers something from his experiences, and attempts to act on what he has learned. The other performances in the film range from the passable (Ving Rhames), to the flat (Bruce Willis), to the really annoying (John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Amanda Plummer).If you want to see the best Tarantino film, watch a film where he creates believable characters and puts them through their paces, albeit with the help of Elmore Leonard source material -- Jackie Brown.


                
A mediocre, poor and shallow film, a silly movies like Pulp Fiction are the reason why Hollywood has always been treated as mere entertainment by French critics. Pulp Fiction is the Star Wars of the 90's decade. To start the film has a story so stupid and clueless, the director, Quentin Tarantino, addicted to video store movies, found that writing a nonlinear script would create a great movie, but it's all nonsense, editing is confuse, the characters are mere wooden planks, the biblical quotation tries to give a seriousness to the film, but is shallower than a teaspoon. Pulp Fiction has yet unnecessary dialogues as Jules and Vincent talking about bacon meat in the restaurant or on the foot massage Mia, the film also relies on Mucguffin created by Hitchcock and Welles in the 40's decade with the suitcase and its golden glow. Pulp Fiction is at best a mediocre film, without depth, mindless entertainment, not important. It's a shame that movies like this have a million votes and artistic works such as Jean Renoir or Shakespeare adaptations have little more than ten thousand. Says a lot about our decline in the arts taste.


                
Is not a review really but I do not knew why I can not set for once and finish the movie I tried 3 times already, after she tells the joke about kat-shup which is great I can not stand the movie any longer.
Maybe some day in the future I'll finish it.
