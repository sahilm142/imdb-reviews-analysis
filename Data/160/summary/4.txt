 'Blood' and oil do not mix

 The Perfect Yawn

 I'm jumping OFF this band wagon in confusion and surprise?! There 'Will' Be a lot of things...entertainment wasn't one of them

 Disappointment of a lifetime

 Disappointing

 Daniel Day-Lewis is great. The rest of the movie...

 Sorry folks, I disagree with all the good ratings

 There will be sleep at There Will Be Blood.

 hugely disappointing

 Why, why, why?

 What a load of rubbish!

 The most depressive movie ever with the worst music ever

 Misleading title, excruciatingly slow pace

 what a boring waste of three hours of my life...fortunately...

 Overrated, pretentious and utterly disappointing

 Hugely overrated, though Daniel Day Lewis is always a star

 Vague experience

 Unbelievalbe (in every sense)

 Masterpiece? I don't think so.

 Punch-Drunk-Blood!

 Well, wasn't that stupid

 Maybe it was P.T. Barnum who made this film?

 Amazing Acting, Bad Story/Plot

 Over rated.

 It didn't deserved to be in #250
