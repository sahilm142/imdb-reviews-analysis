 The best suspense/thriller in animation, PERIOD.

 Suspense the way it should be done

 For the pickiest watcher, Monster is sure to please.

 One of the best experiences ever

 A fantastic anime that not only gets away with taking itself far to serious - but creates one of the most entertaining shows of any type I've ever seen by doing this.

 An intelligent anime

 Worth to watch for those who liked Death Note!

 If you like thrillers this is a must see!

 amazing

 a medical - detective - crime drama

 Naoki Urasawa at his finest

 A Highly Overlooked Exposure to Greatness

 Monster is not just An Anime it is something more.

 A seriously unique crime-drama

 Absolutely magnificent. This is the best thing I've ever seen.

 The fact is that we never knew how to redefine anime in the new century until we see "Monster"

 A beautiful anime with a lot of heart, and one of my all time favourite TV shows

 Intelligent, touching, and fascinating

 The True Meaning Of Loneliness

 Dark anime that's to long for its own good among other things.

 monster is interesting

 All life is created equal...right?

 monster will make the thrillers and mysteries you have watched or read look like child's play.

 Stunning

 A gripping story from start to finish-Suspense at its finest.
