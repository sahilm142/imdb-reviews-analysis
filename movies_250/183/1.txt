Murnau was not a good director. This is a silent movie that does only one thing. It is part of the basis for Hitler's Nazi machine.It goes beyond sick. The hero is a good "German Ideal" male, dark haired like Hitler, and the heroine is the blonde. This goes with the Nazi genocide program, as the movie bends over backward to justify the hero attempting to kill the dark haired woman. Yes, it is dumbfounding. Yes, no rational person could call this anything but a pile of crap, yet we see numerous neo Nazis praising this hate filled high Nazi propaganda in these reviews.It is what it is. There is no subtle hiding of it. These sick movies helped the Hitler genocide program, and in fact were the cause. There is nothing original in this. Nothing of value. It is truly sickening, and only a raving Nazi lunatic could endorse this garbage.
