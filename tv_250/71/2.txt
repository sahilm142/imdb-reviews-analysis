This show is absolutely horrible. I gave it a chance and watched few episodes, and I didn't laugh once. The jokes are boring, as is the plot("What plot?", one might say), there's just simply nothing funny. Many people have written that "not everyone gets this show", well I'm going to burst your bubble...there's actually not much to get. It's a lot simpler show than people like to believe, and the fact that people call this a complex program shows that sitcom-genre in States is nowadays quite sad. But hey, what do you expect in a country where Adam Sandler is a movie star...


                
This is for season 9 only, I loved all others. Not the same, like an old boxer trying to come back way past his prime. The show is flat, jokes are lame, do you really need the money that bad.I can only hope it gets better, can't get much worse.What's with this "the minimum length for reviews is 5 lines of text"


                
I usually have the trouble getting into shows, some of my favorite shows had really rough starts, Rome, Mad Men, Firefly. I usually try to give a show 3 episodes, but this just is not funny. Its bad acting and everything seems so contrived. Mimicking realism is what seems funny to me, unrealistic contrivances with awkward made up 2D characters just make me cringed. I am sure this may get better later on. But I am going to unfortunately have to cut this short, like many other productions these days. Im sorry loved sienfeld and love Larry David but this shows not for me =/ End of review for now I will add one more line because the Minimum review is 10 lines.
