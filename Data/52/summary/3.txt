 One of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time! Not!

 In space, no one can hear you snore...

 Stupid

 Analysis of Alien

 Rather childish film for someone used to modern films

 A historical milestone, yes, but also a bore

 For people with long attention spans only

 I feel like im the only one who didnt like this movie
