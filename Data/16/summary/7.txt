 A good movie, but a little flawed

 nice, but...

 Not as good as the book

 Read the BOOK!!!

 Difficult, fascinating drama runs on pure emotion, not logic...

 An excellent movie, but it could have followed the book better.

 One of Forman's best movie

 Finally have seen it the third time!

 so very sad

 One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest

 Movie Incomplete: Lack of Resolution

 Flower Power's Last Hurrah

 Lighthearted and free-spirited yet surprisingly dark and ultimately poignant.

 Nnnnot as good as the book

 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest: 7/10

 the hardest movie ever made.

 Serious, but sometimes Fuuny

 Good, original movie

 Message is greater than what meets the eyes

 Not as good as the book

 Solidly Disturbing

 Good, but overrated

 7/10

 Solid movie with great acting, but leaves out the imagery the book described so well.

 A Pretty Decent Interpretation
