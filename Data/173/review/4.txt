OK, I'm not trolling this movie, but I sure did feel that this movie was horrible in my own personal opinion. Sure, it did have some wonderful aspects and unique stances in its own ways, but all in all, not my kind of movie.This is supposedly a homage to Japanese action movies, which I seriously dislike (again, just my opinion). I have seen some Japanese action movies, which was all just violence, blood, screams with an entirely peculiar story. I'm not trying to be racist here, but I do feel that Japanese movies lack a sense of dramaticism or storyline that actually makes someone think. Rather, it's just endless bloodshed with a story that's out of the line. Well, Quentin Tarantino (one of my least favorite directors) is paying homage to that. Not so much to pay homage to.I saw this movie through the DVD. I've seen the rave reviews it received and even trusted Ebert and Roeper's review, and I decided to see what all the craze was about. Once I pop it in, it begins with a noirish sense of black and white mood. As the film progresses, it combines Japanese anime and real filming, which I thought was pretty interesting and amazing at the same time. It was though-provoking and very classy, and I enjoyed that part. But then, it just got into endless violence and fake blood actions. One by one, Uma Thurman hacks away at the bad guys and they lose their limbs and body parts, screaming in the most comedic ways. Instead of feeling a sense of sadness for those who died, I actually laughed and pointed at the baddies. Story was pretty simple. It was just a story about a woman who wants revenge against those who betrayed her, in which she made an enemy's list. She goes on a rampage, slicing anyone in her path.I kid you not, Uma Thurman surprisingly freaked me out when she played "The Bride." Who in the right mind would want to meet a woman who can slice you up in any second? She was clever and skilled, and she practically killed anyone in her way, even innocent bystanders. I actually felt scared by the seriousness of her character and was frightened by the actress herself. Very well in acting, I have to admit. All were professionally done.Alright, the only parts in the movie that actually got my nerve was the simple corniness of the film. The bad-guys were honestly horrible actors and they just screamed in the most funniest ways. The cartoony feel was purposely made by QT in order to make it feel as if it was a comic book, but I didn't feel that premise going on. Instead I felt a movie with just the cheesiest amount of blood ever. I was obviously disgusted at how much this movie showed blood. It was simply a gorefest rather than a movie itself.I believed this film did have its awesome moments, but all in all, it was just average, and I couldn't see the reason why it was so raved about. But once again, all in all, that's my opinion, not yours.


                
Spoilers Well, what can I say I would give this movie 4 out of 10 straight up. I thought the idea of uncompromising revenge was excellent BUT there are so many ridiculous scenes that were so overdone it just became a joke. For example the end scene between lucy liu and Uma was so stupid I laughed it was absurd. Tarantino was obviously trying to be artistic but it is as CLEAR AS DAY that he overdid it - wake up people - there are some very stupid people with no sense who gave this 10 out of 10 PLEASE!!!In all the interviews and making of this film they went on about how brilliant the action scenes were and how amazing Uma was - come on people they were pathetic - the fight scenes were s**t - apart from the one with the blue background that was pretty cool the rest of them were - absolute crap. The very first scene was so silly I lost all respect for the film immediately.BUT ABOVE ALL the single worst scene was the very end fight with lucy liu - not only was it not very good as a fight scene - the over the top silent staring that went on for so long was so overdone it became what can only be described as a joke. Here is a tip ladies and gentlemen - you know an action scene is good when at the end you feel "ahh I wish that had been longer" but at the end of the kill bill vol 1 final fight with Lucy Liu I couldn't help but feel thank god that painful crap is finished. lol I just thought of another hilarious scene the one where Uma is on the plane writing her little revenge list that was the most corny stupid dumbass idea ever I actually burst out laughing when I saw that - that was just the final straw.I bet the majority of people who gave this 10 out of 10 were silly little women who are blinded to how crap it is because they are so desperate to have a good movie with the lead badass as a woman - I bet if it was not a woman in the lead they would see it for what it is - very disappointing. And believe me this is coming from someone who is a fan of Tarantino.Now for the use of black and white one word for you ladies and gents UNNECESSARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When the colour came back it was not that bloody.Although very cool the way the screen changed as she blinked - that was coolHowever I will say that this film had some very very good scenes particularly those with Sonny Chiba in the bar where Uma goes to get her sword very funny - excellent! The scene with Uma slapping the young yakuza ass was also very very funny. I really enjoyed the anime scene as well (apart from the excessive blood was a little silly at times) but the absolute uncompromising revenge on Lucy's characters face as a child was amazing - very well set out. In my humble opinion I would say this film would have been much better as an anime - as I said its only real saving grace was its funny scenes with Chiba. Why I seem to be the only one who can see these points mystifies me - there are some very stupid close-minded people with absolutely no taste living in a dream world who thought this film was brilliant. After all that I think I am being generous giving this movie 4 out of 10
Note: I haven't seen vol.2 yet.I'm definitely not an admirer of Tarantino's works but I'm always trying to see all major Hollywood movies and expected something better than that gory disaster. The story here is terribly weak and primitive, like an adaptation of a poor comic book with lots of plot holes and all connection with reality are entirely lost in Kill Bill. Assassin woman seeks revenge and almost everyone she meets gets killed. Nobody cares about characters; they are only decorations for Bride's long way of revenge. We see them, after a while they get killed and soon we forget about them. There is no point denying that Tarantino has his own style and he wants to amaze an audience but I think this time he went too far. Some scenes (like a woman, who couldn't move her toes after all things she has done) only make me laugh from their stupidity and absurdity. However that's not all. Maybe something is wrong with me but I found many parts of the movie too disgusting, even taking into account Tarantino's standards. I don't see in the movie any reasons for that or any author's philosophy or intention which makes any sense. Unfortunately the movie simply looks like one very long brutal bloody fight scene with short, silly and predictable dialog additions, which are mostly intended to excite young teens. These scenes are too stylized with nothing particularly original or extraordinary in them. In Japan Bride is fighting against dozens of opponents but only few of them are actually moving and fighting. The rest of them are waiting for something, perhaps for the short moment when they must appear in front of camera and after a short fight get killed. Until that short moment of glory they are nothing more than decoration. Such choreography could be enough for a cheap eastern action flick but not for a movie that pretends for much better. Hand-to hand fights are much better and sometimes are able to impress but there is also a strong feeling of surrealism and even of somewhat that looks like attractive from inside but inwardly shallow and empty. As I already mentioned vol. 1 is an extremely brutal and gory movie. Somewhere in the middle of the movie I realized that there is nothing else in Kill Bill besides endless violence. I guess that the reason for splitting Kill Bill into two movies was that more than three hours of non-stop over the top violence would be too much even for his fans. If such a movie came from any other director I believe it got NC-17 rating but it's obvious that for Tarantino there are no rules or limits so there is nothing surprising that it had only R rating. Only for one of the most memorable sequences in the movie the anime sequence it deserves NC-17. Besides its ultra violent style the parents can find some moral problems with Kill Bill so I have to warn all parents that this "acclaimed" movie must stay away from your children as far as it possible. Despite the director's statements about awards for Uma Turman, who played the main character I didn't find anything exception about the acting in the movie. Actually too often there was no room for acting behind fight scenes and short dialog. I was not only truly disappointed about wasting my time and money but also I got a negative experience which I will be glad to forget.


                
Tarantino uses every tool in his (and everyone else's') bag, from the fractured story-telling and excessive violence that have become his trademarks through cuts of anime and a morricone-esque soundtrack to a succession of extreme close-ups and gore-filled internal anatomy shots which are lifted straight from the CSI production manual.Unfortunately, for all the skill in reproducing the tricks he fails to conjure anything resembling a worthwhile storyline and despite the numerous star turns is unable to conjure a meaningful film.Great if you want to sit and watch an almost documentary homage to the myriad tricks from past masters all being crammed into 100mins, but as a movie-experience, leave well alone.


                
Erm, this is pretty bad actually. I like R Dogs, P Fiction and J Brown but this and its sequel have none of the imagination or style of those other films. Uma is good as usual and there are a couple of good shots but the plot is awful, no characterisation, the fight scenes (they aison d'etre of the film surely) are feeble compared to Crouching Tiger (the actors just aren't up to the physicality of it all - even the Matrix had better fights) and the dialogue is dull as well. Basically QT thinks he's such a genius he can do anything and no one around him will dare to tell him otherwise. A pretty pointless way to spend a couple of hours in all.


                
Spoilers herein.The title of the comment is from the ersatz master who makes a new sword for our avenger. This denotes what is wrong about this film, indeed why Tarantino is to film as Brittany Spears is to music.Martial arts are about generational wisdom, about the rigidity of the masters all the way back empowering new freedom all the way forward. When a fight occurs, it is not the weapons that are in combat, not even the combatants: it is the respective masters who operate through time and space. Ang Lee understood this when he made his film, one that could reliably called an homage.This is something else, wholly Americanized. Here we have a setup that is from cold war 60's culture, a themed assassination squad. The focus is on the individual. When Uma's character fights, it is in the Eastwood/Segal tradition. This is Yankee individualism filtered through episodic TeeVee and only then cloaked in B-movie style.
For all this to work, we have to have a God. Can be the noir god of detached fate; can be the Hitchcock/dePalma god of the camera; can be the Lynch god of the filmmaker's angst; can be the Leone god of irony, or the Fellini god of parallel dreams, or Medem of animated orgasm, or Bergman of the Judge. Our man Q wants them all, and has to cut each of them to make room for the others. He is not clean and focused like Kurosawa, but jumbled like Rob Zombie.`Once Upon a Time in Mexico' has identical aspirations, but Rodriguez steeps us in something he actually knows, leverages an actor that actually understands irony (not some second rater; remember Mrs Peel and Poison Ivy?), clearly identifies his god/ observer (Depp), and does it all himself: writing, directing, shooting, editing, composing. In comparison, Quentin is a novice and this is a dim conversation in a lonely corner of an effete Hollywood party.As in all of life, there are two kinds of people in film. I'll call them engineers and scientists. Engineers work with known vocabularies and principles. They take insights of others and tinker about with different combinations to accomplish certain practical goals. There is an imagination of sorts, but it extends only so far as understanding the storehouse of components supplied by others. The scientists go where no one else has ever gone, into the void and bring back new reality that they convince us to accept. Which of these you choose for your life in film could determine everything about you, because you live in your imagination. Compare `Ghost Dog' (or even `Pillow Book') to `Kill Bill.' Both are about themselves, cast in terms of what went before. One is subtle, even elusive in its truths. Possibly, it is only one of many stories it is about as the little girl within it reads. The other, `Bill' is already chewed for you. Brittany Spears. They even use the same musician as composer. One is subtle and rich, the other a jukebox.Kurosawa is a scientist; Tarantino a shopkeeper, and that brings me to my final point. Quentin does have terrific storytelling skills. But look at how they are used. All of his attention goes to explaining what happened before, including the trademarkedtimefolds. This is very well done and completely comprehendible. But good storytelling, the really good stuff, is about what happens NEXT. See any of that here?Nope, just sugared breakfast cereal.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
Roger Ebert once wrote that Quentin Tarantino could make a bad film but could never make a boring film. Well, "Kill Bill: Vol. 1" is a boring film. Above all, it's monotonous, because most of the film is just a lengthy series of fights lacking any context that would allow us to side with one character over another. Worst of all, the heroine is presented as some kind of Unstoppable Force whom no one stands a chance against, especially males. This premise reaches the height of absurdity when she takes on a few hundred fighters at the same time. Now, I'm no big fan of "The Matrix" or its sequels, but the scene where Neo battles a hoard of Agent Smiths at least makes sense within the rules the story has established. There is nothing to explain why Uma Thurman's character is so powerful. We're just forced to accept that she's this invincible killing machine, a premise that robs of the film of one of the crucial ingredients of suspense, which is that the main character faces a challenge.Another crucial ingredient that's conspicuously absent is emotional investment in the characters. We're supposed to sympathize with Thurman because of how her cohorts betrayed her, but what difference does it make when she's as much of a cold, ruthless killer as they are? Okay, so she doesn't hurt children. Big deal. She is drawn way too thinly to give us any reason to root for her.You can love or hate "Pulp Fiction," but you cannot possibly accuse it of being predictable. And the characters, while amoral by our standards, have definite human qualities--one of the most telling scenes is when John Travolta says he's going to go home and have a heart attack. It's the type of thing an ordinary person would say in that situation, and it makes you forget that he's a hit-man. I can't figure out why anyone would think that brilliant film is in any way comparable to "Kill Bill: Vol. 1," which is sorely lacking in the witty dialogue that Tarantino is famous for, and which has none of the richness and complexity of "Pulp Fiction" that invites repeat viewings and helps you overlook the fact that you aren't sure what the point of the story is.I also think the violence in this film is excessive. That may seem a strange thing for a Tarantino fan to say. But don't confuse violence with shock: Tarantino is a master at manipulating audience reaction, even when he isn't showing things anywhere near as graphically as he could. A classic example is the needle-to-the-heart scene in "Pulp Fiction." We never see the actual impact, but we do feel it.The stylized gore of "Kill Bill" is a lot less interesting, in my view. It's one thing to show Thurman chop a character's arm off. It's quite another to show a geyser of blood, making it look like the character's body is literally being drained--then, a while later, finding out that the character is not only still alive, but fully conscious and lucid. The rules of this film's universe are so arbitrary there's no point in even talking about suspension of disbelief.The sequel is a vastly superior film, filling in the character motivations, suspense, and humor that the first film so desperately needed. Tarantino could have condensed the events of the first film into fifteen minutes and made the entire story into one long film, which actually would not have been that long. Why did he make the first film as he did, probably turning off many of his former fans? At least he was trying something new rather than simply rehashing his old ideas, but this time the experiment was a failure.


                
Not sure if there are actual spoilers but checked it to be on the safe side.While this was nowhere near the worst movie I have ever seen (those would be The Blair Witch Project and Hannibal), it is nowhere near the top either. The entire screen play must have been written in about 15 minutes. The plot was silly. The dialog was bad, very bad. And it was slow, so slow that I wanted the scenes to be done so they could move along.But it was visually pleasing, if confusing. The switches from color to black and white seemed to be totally random and the anime bit was distracting.It's certainly not what I expected. Though it was oddly compelling.
No, I wasn't expecting another "Pulp Fiction" (or even another "Reservoir Dogs" or "Jackie Brown"). But, as being written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, starring Uma Thurman, I thought this was rather a cool movie.Well, this is not true at all."Kill Bill: Vol. 1" is just 111 minutes of gratuitous violence. There's no story, no good directing, no acting, no fun.Of course, if you like to see absurd fights and lots of people being killed, you'll find this a wonderful movie. For me, it's just the proof that Quentin Tarantino fell down.My vote: 3 out of 10.


                
All this because a woman wanted to start a new life with a guy who owned a record store? So she wanted to have his baby, is that so bad? Why the endless praise, I will never understand.This is merely Tarantinos' constant glorification of killing.Hatchets flying through the air, hands, heads, arms being removed. No one with a gun? She kills a hundred people and no one ever thought to just shoot her? This movie is complete bunk. No better example of why there soon will be no real film industry.Catch the top job performance by old trooper Michael Parks. Then he may have a different part in volume 2?Hey, this is a decent movie to just watch, but no Hollywood 'masterpiece.' The single best part of this movie is listening to those great old songs. They were made to fit in perfectly with the killing.


                
I am surprised with the glowing reviews that this film is getting.It definitely is a highly overrated movie.I must say i was disappointed with the movie.I had anticipated to see some outstanding action scenes and martial art fights in this movie,but it was a big let down.The action sequences were mediocre at best.There is lot of bloodshed in this movie which largely looks fake and artificial.The acting is also not overly remarkable.There is no deeper meaning in this movie.It also lacks emotional appeal.Also there is too much brutal violence just for the sake of it.This movie is different than usual Hollywood action movies but that does not make it a better movie.


                
***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** So now we know why the fourth film from Quentin Tarantino had to become the fourth and fifth films from Quentin Tarantino.  He said that a 3 hour grindhouse kung fu movie would be pretentious.  Well, yes, but only because what you've started with is pretentious to begin with!  In this first hour and a half, so little happens it's unbelievable.  I can't believe that he couldn't have got it down to a decent running time.I'd have been willing to take Uma Thurman's escape from the hospital as read, but Quentin has to show us her wiggling her big toe for minutes on end.  We spend ages watching people get places - Uma's journey to track down O-Ren Ishii, for example, which takes AGES.  There's a scene with a Texan sheriff which does nothing.  We get a lengthy part-animated introduction to O-Ren Ishii, a character who we already know is going to be dead soon anyway.  The use of animation is inspired, I admit, but I just don't care about the story it shows.  What else?  Well, the whole Sonny Chiba sequence is superfluous.  Again, I'd have been quite happy for her just to get a sword from somewhere.  I don't need this man to argue about coffee. Although I did enjoy some of the dialogue (`I'm not bald, I just shaved my head.')So, OK, he's written too much.  But, annoyingly, he's directed too much as well.  Quentin has always stood on a knife-edge when it comes to over-directing, but here he tumbles over it.  Every time the Bride sees someone she wants to kill, the Star Trek klaxon starts blaring, which is irritating.  Also, her name gets blurred every time someone says it, which is just silly.  David Carradine's hands give a great performance, which is slightly tiresome.  He tells the story out of order (as always) and you can sort of see why.  But just occasionally, it hinders rather than helps. Were we supposed to see O-Ren Ishii's name already crossed out on that list? And the Pussy Wagon gets a laugh, sure, but would have got a better one is we first saw it when Uma first sees it.  And as for the fight...Oh, let's get to the big fight sequence now.  Hyped beyond belief, this is Uma Thurman battling 88 people, or something.  Could have been great. Isn't.  I still like it better than Matrix Reloaded's so-called burly brawl, because there's no annoying CGI here.  But after a while, I realised I'd zoned out.  It just wasn't doing it for me.  Partly because he decided to switch to black-and-white, which is just pointless.  And partly because...Well, there's two issues here.  One is that I have never seen a so-called grindhouse kung fu movie.  I have no idea what tradition he is reprising. I only know who Sonny Chiba is through True Romance.  So this movie is not, can not be, targeted at me.The other issue is about violence.  There's just too much of it.  And I don't often say that.  But it loses any effect after a while.  It becomes boring.  And it occasionally becomes distasteful.  When Gogo (?) gets whammed in the head with a plank of wood with a nail through it, her death is lovingly filmed.  He's savouring it.  Whether it's different because these are women isn't an argument I'm going to get into right now, frankly. But when it comes to violence, QT has always been master of implication (the ear-severing) and of the short, sharp shock (Marvin's death).  He almost entirely abandons these in Kill Bill for grand guignol lopping off of limbs.It doesn't work.  His geysers of blood and chopped-off arms only remind me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, while Lucy Liu's death...oh dear.  I found Ray Liotta's scenes at the end of Hannibal to be hilariously bad, and our sighting of O-Ren Ishii's brain at the end of this film pretty much tops even that.Back to distastefulness.  The pregnant Bride is beaten up, shot and put into a coma for 4 years, waking to find her baby gone.  I think that's enough. But no, she has to have been raped continuously for 4 years too.  This is another superfluous sequence.  I could have stood it if it hadn't been treated almost as an amusing aside.  One rapist is killed by having his tongue bitten off in a comical way.  The other has his head banged in a door.  These people, especially Buck, are as sick and evil as the Viper Squad, if not more so, yet she hardly seems bothered about it.So what keeps it from instant 1/10 status? Well, it's a Quentin Tarantino movie.  And he's still got it.  Not all the time, far from it.  But there are a fair few moments that remind me of glory days.  Actually, what with the excellent use of split-screen and cameras passing over the set walls, they remind me most of Brian De Palma circa Snake Eyes, but that's not a criticism.  The film starts promisingly with my favourite scene, Uma Thurman versus Vivica A Fox.  The gun in the cereal is a classic Tarantino moment. There are memorable motifs like the Pussy Wagon, and Uma's Bruce Lee-aping tracksuit.  Lucy Liu isn't far off from being a revelation, and it's nice to see Daryl Hannah resurrected in a role not a million miles away from her Bladerunner days.So have I given up on Quentin Tarantino?  No.  Not quite.  I'll wait till his next film (sorry - his one but next film, I doubt I'll bother will Volume 2).  Because I think this is just something he's been needing to get out of his system.  He's always wanted to make this movie, and now he has. Well done.  If he doesn't now move on and make some movies I want to see, rather than movies Quentin Tarantino (or Clarence Worley) wants to see, then he and I will say bye-bye.
this movie is a sort of adolescent wet dream... ninja woman who acts like a cool man and looks good in a tight suit kills people with a samurai sword...this movie has pitifully little dialogue, and it doesn't have that usual Tarantino snap... what had a delicious pulpy quality in earlier offerings, now comes off as shallow...i suppose we should praise QT for making something a little different to his usual stuff, but frankly, this movie is coma inducing (and it's not really that far out from his previous work)... the chapters between the fight scenes seem like a glass of warm, flat beer... and QT has served up some crisp refreshing ale before, so it's even more disappointing... after the millionth decapitation, mutilation, spray of blood etc (the gore is not shocking, it's so cartoony that you can't really feel anything) you just think: "this movie doesn't hold together and it's boring"...i'll give a few points for the odd spectacular fight scene shot... but frankly it's not a visceral experience, it's not clever, and i left my teens behind six years ago...a cheap kung fu movie with expensive production values... and that ruins whatever magic those types of movies have... oh and the anime stuff in the middle just feels out of place and forced...


                
Kill Bill: Vol 1, Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, tells the story of a female assassin known only as the Bride (Uma Thurman) who is attacked on her wedding day.  She survives the attack but lives in a coma for the next four years at which point she wakes up and begins her plot for revenge.The film demonstrates a total lack of originality.  It both parodies and plays homage to old samurai movies, yakuza, Japanese anime, chop-socky kung fu flicks, blaxploitation films, and spaghetti Westerns.  The references are numerous and begin with the opening credit sequence, a tribute to the Shaw Brothers martial-arts films of the 1970s.  The film spends so much time resembling these other genres that it fails to create its own identity.Tarantino, as he did with Pulp Fiction, plays around with the order of the narrative giving it a non-linear form.  Unlike in Pulp Fiction, however, the reordering of events does little for the film.  It plays like a gimmick; it is there simply as his signature mark.  It contributes nothing to the film's artistry.The end of the movie is revealed very early on making the ensuing battle scenes, which are incredibly gory and drag on endlessly, rather pointless. Nothing is saved for the climax.  The narrative, linear or not, must work toward the uncovering of some level of meaning or understanding about the films core themes.  This film doesnt have any themes.  Kill Bill is one big ass-kissing job by Quentin Tarantino to the film genres that have entertained him for so long.Tarantino fans will be disappointed as the film lacks the Tarantinoesque dialogue they have come to enjoy.  The plot is thin and what back-story we are given pertains to all characters except the main character played by Uma Thurman.  The audience, therefore, cannot empathize with her and join her in battle.  The film will catch the attention of guts and gore fans, though one scene was filmed in black and white to tone down the severity of the gore enabling the film to retain an R rating.If you enjoy action and only action then this film is for you.  Substance seekers stay away.  In the words of Tarantino himself: "...we've all seen this before...you know the story goin' in...it's easy to follow."


                
The fights are truly excellent (if you happen to dig near-realistic, ultra-violent, gore-packed screen fighting with some tasteful stylistic effects), as are the parts directly preceding the fights and the whole beginning of the movie. All in all, about 20-25 minutes.The rest of the 111 minutes consists of some lousy humor and a lot of dragging scenes as a result of awesomely bad scripting, naturally iced with Tarantino's trademarks, chapters and non-linear timeline (this time actually adding very little to the film besides the nice beginning). Animation episode is a very nice touch, but terribly realized (unimaginatively clichéd & ugly art).Most of the casting is quite satisfactory, with few excellent choices and a highly average lead. Although Uma Thurman handles the action parts very well, she just lacks the edge and presence to be anywhere near believable in her ample bravado, thus underlining the B-movie feeling of this film in an unfavorable way -- a truly charismatic lead might have been able to make the (purposefully) corny lines both hilarious and impressive, but her efforts fall flat.If you want to see ultra-violent fighting and enough blood to engulf Tokyo, watch Shogun Assassin or any other movie Tarantino (tastefully) has taken his inspiration from. The plentiful mediocre and plain bad aspects of this film easily counter and knock out the worthy fighting moments (although you might want to check them out on some medium that allows you to skip right to the beef).


                
I finally got to see, first hand, what all the "Kill Bill" fuss is all about. Unfortunately, it is only half a movie, so I am required to give it a rating of "4", expecting that after I see the second part, I will have rated the entire movie as "8". QT obviously set out to make a spoof of the martial arts movies of Asia, and did a good job. I really was entertained, and use of the exaggerated spurting of blood when a head or limb was cut off reminded me that the film is not to be taken seriously. Plus, the scene where "The Bride" single-swordedly defeated a trained army of perhaps 30 or so martial arts experts was pure "camp."Thurman was a great choice to play "The Bride". She moves well and has a comedic timing that just works well. Lucy Liu is menacing as O-Ren Ishii. Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and David Carradine as Bill complete the main cast. The whole story, which is secondary to the "look" of the picture, is Bill having left "The Bride" for dead at her wedding, and after recovery in a hospital, escapes and sets off the kill all those on her list. This first installment shows us how she gets rid of the first half of her list. I guess I will find out about the second half in due time. To be continued ...
Well i finally got round to watching Kill Bill,and on the whole i have to say i was disappointed.From Tarantino,who's movies stand out as being fresh and inspiring,i felt let down on several points.I guess firstly,there was no pace to the film,nothing to want me to keep watching except maybe the hope that it was going to improve as it went on,which it did,a little,but not enough for me to feel any emotion or intensity.Secondly,the dialogue.QT's previous films had dialogue that kept you listening,no matter how trivial the subject,there was always humour,and a little something that made it memorable,i felt here the dialogue was more like idle chit chat that really went no where. BUT....i did enjoy the fight scene with Daryl Hannah,so hey it wasn't all bad.Overall,an average film that i was really hoping to get more from,maybe i'll watch it again and enjoy it?...we'll see.


                
A note of reality to any film fan planning seeing this - its awfulIt isn't cool, the dialogue is awful, there's way too many cameos, its awkwardly directed, it doesn't gel or flow, it (at best) mimics the style of martial arts films, it has no charm.After an hour I ceased to take it in. it takes a really bad film to break my concentration, but I found myself thinking 'this is REALLY stupid' I mean DUMB. Its a big dumb film.Now I did enjoy Tarantinos previous films, but this is just a big self-indulgent mess. Its obvious he has nothing to say anymore.I honestly felt I'd wasted 2 hours. No emotional reaction apart from a resigned cry of 'pointless!'.


                
Kill Bill, Vol. 1, at its heart, is really a simple tale of a wanna-be murder gone wrong and the revenge that courses through the intended victim. However, in Quentin Tarantino's hands, Kill Bill is an overblown blood fest.Uma Thurman plays 'The Bride,' who is also known as 'Black Mambo.' She was a part of an elite killing squad with 4 other adept assassins played by Vivica A. Fox, Darryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and Lucy Liu. These five killers are headed up by Bill, whose face we never see in the movie. For some unexplained reason, Bill and his four killers set out to murder a very pregnant Black Mambo on her wedding day. They torture and kill Black Mambo and her unborn child<U+0085>so they think. Black Mambo/The Bride awakens from a four year coma with revenge killing on her mind. The movie switches back from the distant past, to the recent past, and to the present at lightening speed without making much of a cohesive plot. The flick is filled with Quentin Tarantino -esque pop culture references and pseudo-philosophical speeches from his characters. The only thing lacking in the dialogue is his normal excessive usage of the word n***ger.Kill Bill, Vol. 1, is an ostentatious homage to the 1950s Japanese samurai, the 1970s kung fu, and the late 80s/early 90s Hong Kong action movies. I even suspect that Lucy Liu's character's name, O-Ren Ishii is a homage to the rap group N.W.A. (O standing for the first letter in Ice Cube's real name, Oshay. Ren for the deejay of N.W.A., and 'ishi' sounds a lot like 'Eazy-E.') I give the movie four stars out of ten for the plot twist at the end, the excellent swordplay, and the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA's spot-on original scores.


                
It is expected that this film would be violent, but the plot was not as good as Pulp Fiction or other films by the same director. Uma Thurman did a good job in her role, but the action was a bit over the top. There was certainly a strong Kung Fu influence on this movie and many of the fight sequences reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies except blood covered every scene. If you love blood & guts and love to see blood & guts in every scene then this film is for you. If you thought there would be a great storyline then you might be disappointed. Doubt I will watch Kill Bill vol 2 since it is apparent from the first volume what will happen in the sequel. I will have to admit Lucy Lu was fabulous in her role.


                
After hearing so much I rented this with high expectations, a la Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.Anyway, I've read some the other reviews and it seems it's all been said so I will be brief.Quentin: grow the hell up and you will be the best director alive today, better than Speilberg Coppola Jonze etc. You have skill, vision, ability.But as long as you feel the need to show us blood blood and grotesque crap that reaks of 19 year old fun for all, you will be relegated to George Romero status and be written off by history as any other action bloody director.This movie stunk, bit could've been great without the spurting blood and brain scenes. Oh and the little girl witnessing mom's incident--you are a jackass.


                
I saw this last night and am glad I only rented it. I think Tarantino is a hack and a thief. Don't get me wrong, I liked resevoir dogs and the first half of that vampire movie, but 'Pulp Fiction' and this were crap to me.Now, I know, I know, there are legion who think this man is a genius for taking anime to its next level and making us pay twice for it, and there may be something to that. For my part, I can only see Quentin salivating over scene after scene where two hotties battle each other in high naughty school girl film attire. The violence was punctuated by scenes more unnecessary than any segue from a modern Stephen King novel. To me this movie looks like someone loaned $140,000,000.00 and forty hot woman to a bunch of anime geeks with oxicream still on their noses and they shot this crap.


                
...people would be laughing it off of the screen.I couldn't tell the difference between this movie and "Ecks vs. Severe". Maybe if I'd never seen a movie before, or wasn't distracted by Tarantino referencing himself. Plenty of good ideas, but strung out through a pretty boring story about characters I couldn't care less for. There's plenty of action, but eventually it becomes too much, and anything interesting that might be happening in the combat sequences is swallowed up by the ridiculous length of the scenes. It could have used some very heavy editing, but Tarantino's name carries too much weight, and (like Lucas's episode's one and two) nobody seems to have been able to convince him to make the cuts. It's still hip to love the Q.T., though. Eh. I'd like my money back, sir.


                
Quentin Tarantino (QT) has a big interest for asian cinema. His debut film `Reservoir Dogs' was influenced by Ringo Lam's `City on Fire', Bruce Willis wields a samurai sword in the award winning `Pulp Fiction', and Patricia Arquette watches `A Better Tomorrow 2' and `Street Fighter' in QT's script to `True Romance'. With `Kill Bill' (KB), QT's fourth feature film, he sets all eyes on the asian school of filmmaking. In KB, QT sums up all things in he likes about chop socky films from the 70/80s, and adds a small dose of spaghetti westerns and blaxploitation themes as well. Boy, has he watched many films during his life time! Perhaps too many, I'm afraid.KB is about the female killer (played by Uma Thurman) waking up from a 4-year coma after she was betrayed by her associates. Her task is to take revenge on them, The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and - especially - kill their leading mystery man Bill (hence the title). The simple revenge story leaves much to be desired from a man of QT's calibre, since this he surely knows how to write stories and scripts. But if we leave the main story aside and interpret it as homage to the typical action film genre (where revenge often is a classic motif) KB needs to rely on QT's fantastic dialoguewriting. But also this leaves me empty. There are no classic and memorable lines like Samuel L Jackson's `Royale with cheese'-monologue or nifty stories like the ones told in `Reservoir Dogs'. His way of storytelling was so superior that it spawned a zillion QT wannabes, most successful probably being Guy Ritchie's gangster films made by and for pint heaving lads. The coolness that once was QT's trademark is gone, well at least most of it. Because in the middle of this somewhat empty film are some highlights. I'll now present the pros and cons of this movie:[ + ]* Uma Thurman is a good cast, her fine, soft appearance contradicting the typical roughness and hard-edged sterotype of an avenger. Here we have a real femme fatale in action. Although the character is as thin as paper, she does a good job portraying this anonymous Bride With No Name (her name is bleeped out for some reason, hopefully revealed in KB Vol.2). The use of female characters is also welcome since worldwide action cinema needs female heroes to ascend from Cheng Pei Pei in `Come Drink With Me', through blaxploitation films from the 70s and all the way to Carrie-Anne Moss of the `Matrix' fame. Also take note that apart from two killings in the film, all of the bodycounts in KB is put up on the women's account. Judging on the brutal finale, that's about a 90 - 2 lead for the gals.
* This film is oozing with style. The camera work is top notch at times. There are split screens, kung fu-close ups, reversed timeline, an animated section, unrealistic stylizations of violence and homages to films galore, which.
[ - ]* .at the same time makes the movie rather shallow. Yes, I have also seen `The Lone Wolf and Cub' series. Yes, I know Sonny Chiba was a bad ass in `Street Fighter'. Yes, I get the Shaw Brothers references. Yes, I've seen a lot of anime. In other words: I've witnessed many films which in their original form was stylized and worked perfectly by its independent self. What KB does, is that it takes (steals, borrows or any verb of your choice) all those neat, little details or trademarks from those films and goes over the top, to a point where you grow tired of the so obvious references that you yearn for something original instead of a homage. The most relevant film in KB's case is `Lone Wolf and Cub' or `Lightning Swords of Death' or `Shogun Assassin' or whichever version you prefer. The spectacular but somewhat overlong finale of KB echoes the massive slaughterhouse endings of several Hong Kong action movies and has Uma Thurman - dressed in Bruce Lee's yellow track suit from `Game of Death' (`ho ho ho, another neat reference' I hear the 13-year-old, pimple faced action nerd chuckle) - battling off The Crazy 88, basically a bunch of mad Japanese killers hired to protect Lucy Lui's character, in a manner reminiscent of the `Lone Wolf and Cub' series. In those movies violence was extreme, blood spurted like water from a fire extinguishing hose and limbs were easily dismembered by razor sharp swords. KB is not original in that sense. QT just want to do a film that looks like those cult genre movies he (and therefore indirectly also his fans) has been watching himself for years. Too bad it just falls flat like his friend Robert Rodriguez' `From Dusk till Dawn' - another shot at doing a crossover genre film with a high quality cast.* Another trademark of QT is his choice of music in his films. But, really, haven't we grown tired of this cool, hip surf/rock n roll/funk music in his productions? Even the usage of an edited, short version of The Human Beinz' classic garage song `Nobody But Me' seem extremely misplaced in the context of a ferocious sword battle. And The RZA's original music is at times uneven too. Take for instance the climax battle between Lui and Thurman where theold Wu Tang Clansman uses a spaghetti western style song (another homage, off course) to minimal effect. That scene would profit from no music at all.
* The violence in KB is extreme by western standards. This is explicitly marked out for the viewers when the huge sword battle suddenly turns black and white as an eyeball is ripped out of its socket, Sonny Chiba style. This may not only tone down the colors of gore on screen but also have a certain style effect. In asia however, the scene is in full color. Obviously, the asian audience have got the stomach for that sort of thing. Sometimes the violence is comical, sometimes it's stylized. And sometimes it's downright dumb, and we don't really need that stupidity.The intent of KB surely has to be to pay a tribute to an inspiring movie scene that in the last couple of years has influenced the Hollywood way of making action films. I bet QT wants you to buy/rent the real deal after seeing KB. It's a shame though that the real deal is much better than KB and it's quite a mystery that a master screenwriter like QT doesn't have the talent to fill a movie with a decent script. And originality. What KB is at the moment is more like `a late night pizza kinda movie'. And is that really what we wanted or expected from QT? Is this the same person that won a Palme d'Or some years ago?Rating: 4 / 10


                
What a mess! Once "The Bride" grabs her flight to Japan, I suggest you unfasten your seatbelt, feel free to walk about the cabin and right out of the theater. "Kill Bill Vol.1" is a "Batman & Robin" version of the great films of Asian cinema. Honor the originals and, like Tarantino, enjoy them first hand.
