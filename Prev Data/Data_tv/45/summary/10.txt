 Network television at its absolute best

 I still remember the night it premiered... and being mesmerized by the opening

 Wow, Bob, Wow...

 Absolutely a must see!!!

 Tragically beautiful

 OMG!! WOW!!! The best TV series I've ever seen!

 One of the most intriguing and fascinating TV shows ever made

 An absolutely masterful quirky television series that ended much too soon.

 An experiment that became ground-breaking television

 quite simply, a Tour De Force

 Excellent with coffee!

 Holy Crap!

 Timeless pioneer in TV

 A marvelous trip into no mind's land

 There is something strange about the town of Twin Peaks

 A Series that ended too soon, A Classic Show

 A Damn Fine Cup of Coffee

 Twin Peaks is one of the greatest shows of the history of television.

 This is my favourite peak district drama!

 Best of its kind

 Watch Until They Solve the Murder of Laura Palmer
