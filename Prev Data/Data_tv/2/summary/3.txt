 Most Overrated Show in History

 Not worth the time

 Beautiful, well acted and ridiculous.

 The novelty wore off 2 seasons ago

 Garbage

 A show with ups and downs and definitely overrated.

 Season five has gone off the rails. Just not the same show.

 Incoherent

 Poor storytelling, slow and boring

 Banal Fantasy Soap Opera for Teenagers

 Predictable, Old, Nothing to Root For

 Nothing special at all.

 much ado about nothing

 Spoiled Fun

 Another one...

 Enough

 Unfortunately, a waste of time

 Violent and depressing

 Most overrated show of our time

 Poorly written, poorly directed, poorly produced. Completely disappointed.

 Predictable, unnecessary nuance.

 Disappointing

 Pretty boring

 Most overrated and boring series ever

 Season 7 should be much Longer
