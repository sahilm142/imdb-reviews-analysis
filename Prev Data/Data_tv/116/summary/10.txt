 An investment

 A wonderful miniseries that deserves more exposure

 One of the best animes I've ever seen.

 its really heartbreaking!!!

 This is going to be one big spoiler since I don't know how to put Kenshin in any other way

 I am a loyal fan to Kenshin and the Samurai x series

 soundtrack rules as well...

 This anime deserves an all 10

 There can be no equal.

 this is...different

 KICK-@SS

 Greatest Anime Ever.

 Gut-wrenching in more ways than one

 Situated in a pre-tv series timeline, this four part OVA will leave you speechless.

 A very emotional and powerful masterpiece!

 Best Movie...EVER!

 Not a good way to break up

 Excellent

 Rurouni Kenshin - Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuioku Hen - NO Spoilers

 Very rare - movie is better than the series

 Best OVA series out there(best anime???)

 The Bloody Romantic Beginnings of Battousai

 Memorable Tragedy

 Best anime in my life

 This great movie will go down as the best of the best and rightfully so
