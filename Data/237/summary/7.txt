 "My job is to look after the Lady."

 Intriguing drama

 Surprising story with a few problems

 Lavish but lackluster

 a real art piece

 Stylish and original

 A strange, twisted, beautiful ride, from the director of "Oldboy."

 Intriguing

 Made with a lot of class

 Beautiful to watch, but very complex and confusing
