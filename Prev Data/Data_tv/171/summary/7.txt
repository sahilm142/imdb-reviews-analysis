 Ragnar = Vikings

 From an excellent TV show to an average one

 American rewriting of history (again)

 Losing Steam and Accuracy

 Season 1-3 are 10/10, season 4 is just meh.

 Series died at the same time as Ragner...

 Shame how it's ended up

 Free society depicted as fascist state with absurdly violent absolute rule

 No Viking funeral to honor a King?

 Still solid enough on season 5, but it's in danger of getting a bit Game of Thrones

 Season 5 was disappointing

 Spectacular locales, weak script, terrible acting

 The latest seasons let down the high expectations set by the first few.

 First 3 seasons 10 starts rest of show 1 start

 Used to be better

 Not as good as people say it is!!

 The Season 5 is not as good as before

 Awesome start but gets quite bad later on

 Should stop with the 4th season

 Great show....but also suffers from a common frustration.

 Overall enjoyable, though not highly accurate

 fun but accurate?

 The History Channel series Vikings is a fabulous saga full of exiting characters, good action, and realistic Viking settings.

 To all the whiners about "historal inaccuracies" go watch PBS

 Overrated
