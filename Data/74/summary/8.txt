 One of the best films ever made

 Epic recreation about a notorious Scottish hero who purposes to free his country from the tyranny of Edward I

 It was a really good movie but with a lot of inaccuracies

 The search for freedom

 A well executed epic though not exactly historically accurate

 A beautiful movie.

 I loved it
