This is one of those legendary films that for some reason I just hadn't seen. I have now! I don't think it could ever meet the hype that people put on it, but i can't deny that it is a good film, and certainly one of the iconic ones of the 80's.It's a bit overly long though, and I think it could have been in need of tighter editing, but you can't argue with the quality and performances given by the cast.I enjoyed this film, I thought it was clever, but I can't say it'll be a film I return to regularly.
