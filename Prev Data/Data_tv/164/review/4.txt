Being the first episode I went with a medium vote. I had personal knowledge of both women during and after the filming of Baby Jane. Both actresses look OK in their depiction and I hope the writers don't go overboard on the following episodes. I believe that "Bette" looks more like the real Bette, however "Joan" looks a bit odd in the eye area. Both seem to have captured the essence of their characters and lets hope it continues in this way. Curious about the other stories to be presented.
