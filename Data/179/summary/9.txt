 All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players !!!!!!

 Almost as terrible as the book.

 David Fincher does it again!

 Another Tense, Finely Crafted Effort from Fincher

 Twisted

 A Hitchcockian thriller of postmillennial proportions

 Another hit for Fincher

 A Well-Crafted Thriller

 Loved loved loved every bit of it!

 Really Good Story of a Psychopathic Killer

 It's clever, funny, something a little different.

 Detective hat and cape on, Holmes.

 Atmospheric, engaging and smart.

 Excellent casting Roseamund Pike

 Amazing, Gripping, Thrilling...

 Gone Girl is a Brilliant Thriller

 A fantastic thriller that always interests you

 A good thriller but also unrealistic~~spoiler alert~~

 Amazing and Clever

 Feel bad for all the people who are hating on the movie

 Not expecting that
