I bought the dvd after reading how great it was here on imdb. Well, I must say, Im glad it only cost me 13$. The acting was bad and so was the score. A thru and tragic story ruined by Hollywood. Did not feel anything for the caracters. I belive the experinece of it was more dramatic, tragic and sad than the movie got to tell. Very bad storytelling.


                
This is 2005, more than forty years after the movie was made. I would say the major difference between this and modern films is the way the prisoner of war camp seemed to be more like a cheap motel, with lots of privacy for the prisoners, seemingly pretty nice Germans in charge (granted, they were wearing blue, so it may have been a WWII Grand Illusion interplay), easy to get supplies for the escape. But everything was just too easy, again something of the sixties films. The movie was really about temperamental conflicts while building the tunnel, but these were based on stereotypes of characters, not real emotional differences. But, it's a classic, so I watched more of it than I really should have.
