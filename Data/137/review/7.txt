Stanley Kramer's extraordinarily lengthy take on the Nuremberg trials is truly an actor's showcase. However, Abby Mann's grave and somewhat verbose teleplay is never particularly entertaining. Spencer Tracy is a Maine judge sent to Germany to oversee the trial of four German judges accused of crimes against humanity. Tracy is quite stoic and the film offers a number of great parts for a number of great actors: Montgomery Clift; Burt Lancaster; Marlene Dietrich; Judy Garland. Garland in particular is astounding in the role of a German woman forced to relive the horrors she endured under the Third Reich. Richard Widmark is the American prosecutor and he's well matched against Maximillian Schell as the fiery German defense attorney. Filmed both on location and on a Hollywood sound stage, the film is decidedly non-cinematic; as though Kramer did not want to present such a serious subject in any way that may seem too flashy. Werner Klemperer, Edward Binns and William Shatner are in it too. The music score is by Ernest Gold and the B&W cinematography is by Ernest Laszlo. Clift, unable to remember his dialog, reportedly improvised much of his part. Director Kramer would lighten up considerably with his next film (IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD).
Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" is a courtroom drama based on the Nuremberg trials for war crimes which were held in the years following WWII. In particular, it was inspired by the Judges' Trial, which focused on a group of jurists.As producer, Kramer saw to it that his film was populated with an enviable cast. The performances of Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift all resulted in Oscar nominations, while Maximilian Schell, reprising his role from an earlier television production, took home the Best Actor Oscar. Also starring were Marlene Dietrich, Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark. Given this lineup, it is unsurprising that the acting is likely the picture's strong suit.However, that is not to say that the other elements of the film are unremarkable. After all, the picture did land eleven Oscar nominations, which suggests (accurately, in this case) that the film's production was a well-rounded one. While Kramer's direction gets somewhat repetitive over the course of three hours the cinematography and art direction are quite attractive throughout. All were awarded with Oscar nominations but, strangely, Ernest Gold's evocative score wasn't.Besides Schell's victory, the only other Oscar win went to Abby Mann for his adapted screenplay. To my mind, it's pretty good but not entirely successful. My main complaint is that Mann tries to do too much. While I give him credit for tackling the thorny subject of the guilt of the German people at large I don't think that it was handled particularly well. Bringing this angle into the film only made it seem more like a glib condemnation of the entire German people, which I hope was not Mann's intention. For me, consideration of this bigger picture only hurt the main thrust of the narrative, which, while not exactly clear-cut, was more well-defined.Ultimately, even though the script is the film's chief weakness, Kramer & company manage to hold the viewer's attention for the full three hours. While the film has several good points it also has the potential for coming across as self-righteous, so your appreciation of it may owe as much to personal factors as to filmmaking craft.


                
This is a long-winded but absorbing drama about Nazi leaders being tried for war crimes. Mann's script raises some intriguing issues about law and morality. It features an impressive all-star, although everybody seems to be bucking for an Oscar. Except for Tracy and Dietrich, everybody has bursts of overacting. Schell is interesting to watch not because his is a great performance, but because he is so incredibly hammy. Clift is touching as a witness. Much of the blame for overacting must go to Kramer, who tends to be heavy-handed and theatrical. His direction of the courtroom scenes is frustrating to watch because of his ever-moving camera and amateurish zooms.


                
Stanley Kramer was more active as a producer rather than a director, but, when he stood for something, he would often take up the reigns himself. Kramer made no apologies for producing "message films," and, though his transparent motives have the potential to age poorly, there's no doubt that he had the stature to approach controversial issues <U+0096> such as racism {'The Defiant Ones (1958)'}, religion {'Inherit the Wind (1960)'} and the Holocaust <U+0096> with confidence and dignity. 'Judgement at Nuremberg (1961)' wears its pretensions on its sleeve, a film so utterly convinced of its own importance that Kramer must surely have already known about the eleven Oscar nominations before he opened production. Fortunately, much of this self-importance is quite justified. The epic 186-minute courtroom drama tackles some of the fundamental issues in the aftermath of WWII, such as the accountability of higher citizens for the Holocaust and how patriotism has the ability to corrupt human morals. With a mighty cast of Hollywood stars, Kramer impartially dissects the Nuremberg trials, exposing tragedy and hypocrisy.Courtroom dramas have remained such audience favourites because they are a showcase for emotional outbursts and impassioned monologues. 'Judgement at Nuremberg,' in keeping with the tone of its subject matter, is largely gloomy and subdued, only occasionally reaching the thrilling highs of Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men (1957),' Robert Mulligan's 'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' or Kramer's own 'Inherit the Wind (1960).' Any speech by Maximilian Schell {who won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, despite being billed fifth} keeps you fixated on the screen, and, likewise, Burt Lancaster's confession and Montgomery Clift's interrogation are must-see moments. The remainder of the film occasionally falls in stagnation, perhaps an inevitable consequence of its format and length, though the drama remains quite watchable, even if I wouldn't fancy a re-viewing until several years from now. The performances are impressive across the board, though Judy Garland, who somehow still retains the rosy cheeks of her childhood, seems terribly out-of-place in such a grim drama.When he isn't in court, American Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) experiences the post-war German lifestyle, as its defeated citizens attempt to reconstruct their shattered lives amid the humiliation of being branded "evil" by the rest of the world. Screenwriter Abby Mann has it both ways on this issue: on the one hand, he represents the ordinary German civilians as proud and resourceful people, who could never have known the true extent of Hitler's regime. However, Judge Haywood later lambasts this perception, asserting that this argument is merely a self-made delusion, and that their inaction <U+0096> and, indeed, the inaction of the whole world <U+0096> was just as contemptible as the acts of those who physically committed the atrocities of the Holocaust. In stating what he believes to be the truth, Haywood invokes the ire of the American government, and severs his close friendship with Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), whose husband was executed for his leadership of the German Army. The truth, it seems, was not something that most people wanted to hear, but Stanley Kramer said it, and we listened.


                
This is a heavy one, so be prepared. If you've seen any similar films, either about Nazi Germany or Apartheid South Africa, you'll know what to expect, but if you haven't, I'll give you a little background about the plot. Judgement at Nuremberg is a courtroom drama based on the real Nuremberg trials in 1947, where four Germans stand trial for their role in the atrocities of WW2. The plot would have been enough to make this film a famous classic, but in addition to the very heavy and popular subject matter, the all-star cast makes it a must-see for pretty much everyone:Spencer Tracy plays the judge, Burt Lancaster is one of the defendants, Richard Widmark is the prosecutor, Maximilian Schell is the defense attorney, and Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Montgomery Clift, and William Shatner join the courtroom action. Everyone is given powerful monologues to recite. Director Stanley Kramer must have given his actors fantastic direction, because they're all in top form as they cry, argue, judge, defend, and confess. Maximilian Schell took home the Best Actor Oscar in 1962, and the film garnered another nine nominations that year.


                
First I was worried about the bumpy start. The first trial scenes show constant translating between English and pseudo-German (most actors are obviously not German native speakers). Thank god this stopped after 15 minutes where they switched all to English. (A weird artistic decision, as subtitles would be much more elegant.)The execution is probably influenced by 12 Angry Men, which came out a few years prior. The movie could have been more focused by centering on fewer characters, also trimming the running time. Performances are outstanding at parts but sometimes heavily overacted. And you have to suspend disbelief sometimes, look beyond fake German accents, which are put on by some actors while others don't even bother.OK, now to the subject matter, which raises hard questions - if you acknowledge that the world is not always black or white. 
In many aspects the movie feels very like 1961. Later work of Bernhard Schlink ("The Reader"), for example, demonstrates a more distanced, insightful and complex way to judge guilt within such an inhumane, cruel regime.
 
This movie generally speaking aims mostly for emotionalizing. To an audience of the 21st century, this movie, however, has a different effect as to audiences in 1961 (especially with the dawn of the cold war being noticeable). A lot of scenes address that the USA needed Germany against the Soviets, which influenced the judgement and whether the USA should "go easy" on them.One key moment is when the prosecuted former judge admits guilt of himself and his country and acknowledges it as important to move forward. Watching this movie in 20xx A.D., one has to notice, that this admittance of guilt (symbolized by certain characters more than others) is a major part of the narrative of German identity by now and has been for decades and generations. Like the judge had to make a decision from his point of view (after 1945), a today's reviewer has to review from today's perspective. Summing up, the emotional impact this movie aimed for in 1961 is slightly dated by now. (Which is, of course, not to say that the shown filmed evidence of concentration camps is in any way less shocking today.)
It's 1948. Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) has just arrived at Nuremberg to preside over a trial against various defendants including former Minister of Justice Dr. Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) who was a well respected jurist before the Nazis. The big names are all gone. It's not a much sought after job to judge the lesser known names. He's staying at a house owned by Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich). The prosecutor for the case is Col. Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark). The defense is led by Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell).This is an important movie of historical value. At a running time of over 3 hours, its rather slow prodding pace takes away much of the drama. The acting from the leads are superb. I give this movie an extra point for a realistic slice of history. This movie isn't as concerned about pacing as much as it's concerned about the subject. It's more a history lesson than a thriller drama.


                
The makers of this movie deserve credit for taking on a difficult subject - the culpability of dutiful servants of a terror regime - and for trying to illuminate it from both moral and legal angles. The choice of judges as defendants is perfect - as spelled out in a remarkable speech by the prosecutor, these men were well educated and mature when the Third Reich began to make a mockery of the rule of law. And yet, they consented to serve within this warped legal system that degraded them from independent servants of justice to accessories in crimes against humanity.As others have noted, cast and acting are excellent. My main reservation is that, considering that this movie takes a full 3 hours, many of the characters remain too sketchy and unconvincing. The charges against three of the defendants are never spelled out, and their counsels never speak; they plead not guilty, sulk through the proceedings and are simply sentenced in the end. The only defendant that is more fully developed is a curious combination of courage, arrogance and submissiveness, brilliance and delusion, cynicism and remorse; he remains too enigmatic and out of the common for being able to 'explain' how more ordinary Germans really ticked and functioned in the Third Reich.Some minor quibbles concern the historical context: Nuremberg, in 1948, certainly was in the middle of reconstruction, no longer just a pile of rubble; the Berlin crisis certainly did not threaten the 'loss of Germany and of Europe', and Dachau and Belsen were concentration camps alright but not the major sites of the annihilation of the Jews. Still, compared with the liberties taken by more recent Hollywood productions, this movie remains tolerably close to historical fact.
One can't hate this movie, but one has to regret that it never quite fulfills the promise of its best moments.  These include not only the finely etched performances of Dietrich and Schell, but also the deep irony that dogs a passionate prosecution of crimes that America itself committed then, and commits today; crimes to which America was indifferent in the shadow of the cold war.  Schell's invocation of Oliver Wendell Holmes for the defense should (but undoubtedly doesn't) give pause to the seemingly innumerable contemporary supporters of eugenics. It was my first exposure to the filmed records of Shoah (I was about 12 when I first saw the movie) and those images can never, I hope, be erased.  And yet, and yet--it is so dull, it is so cut to fit the formulae of Hollywood; and, as other commenters have pointed it, it has Tracy at his pompous predictable liberal worst, rehearsing Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.  His best scenes are as Dietrich's foil; the very best when he is the excuse for her commentary on Lili Marlene.This is painfully close to a great movie; its failure is especially sad because its subject calls for greatness.


                
Judgment at Nuremberg has an intense emotional energy, which plays well against the inherently philosophical nature of the piece.  Performances are uniformly excellent, especially among the supporting cast, and Schell certainly deserved his Oscar.My major qualm with Judgment is the Spencer Tracy character. Just as in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Tracy is an almost unbearably self-righteous fellow who says things the rest of the movie illustrates better and more cinematically; he makes the moral very heavy-handed.  All in all, though, a beautifully done working of a superb screenplay.


                
"Judgment at Nuremberg" features great performances from Lancaster, Garland, Clift and Oscar winner Schell. Spencer Tracy is rather boring until the finale. The length and the strange cinematography really took away from the overall strengths of the movie, which were the performances. A good historical story which I think is worth watching if you have 3 hours to kill. I don't know about anyone else, but the fact that William Shatner was there bothered me. He'll always be Kirk to me I guess. Also, be prepared to see Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland looking very very old. The non-courtroom scenes really were boring and seemed rather awkward, like they didn't belong in the film.


                
With a star studded cast and a very long running time, this is a philosophical but fictionalised account of the Nuremberg trials inspired by true events.Once the more infamous Nazis have been tried and prosecuted, it is the turn for the more lesser known suspects. Spencer Tracy as lead Judge Dan Haywood presides over the trial of four judges who have been charged with war crimes as they implemented the laws of the Nazi regime. These include enforcing laws of racial purity and sterilising undesirables such as the feeble minded.Burt Lancaster plays a renowned jurist Ernst Janning whose activities baffle Dan Haywood as his work on the law is so well respected.In the background of rising tensions between the Americans and the Russians with the developing Cold War, there is a ferocious courtroom battle between prosecuting attorney, Colonel Lawson (Richard Widmark) and Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) who relentlessly badger the witnesses.Lawson who liberated one of the concentration camps holds the entire nation responsible for the atrocities, yet his own actions at the courtroom are cynical. Rolfe is more pragmatic about any other nation trying to claim a moral high ground. As he tells Janning, the Americans dropped a nuclear bomb in Hiroshima that killed countless women and children.Judge Haywood tries to understand himself about the German people during the war, he mingles with locals and gets to know a widow, Frau Bertholt played by Marlene Dietrich. Her own husband was executed by the Nuremberg trials but she insists that many Germans had no idea about the holocaust. However Haywood is troubled about the Nazi atrocities, those who were enablers and other who turned a blind eye to it.Director Stanley Kramer keeps this long film enthralling, some of the court cases are vignettes allowing actors such as Montgomery Cliff and Judy Garland to give short memorable performances.Maximilian Schell gets the more emotional role as the defence lawyer and at times he gets to chew the scenery but he also won a best actor Oscar. Burt Lancaster is more restrained as Janning, he hardly speaks for most of the film but his face is solemn and stern. A man who has realised he did wrong by condemning some of his own people to death and now has to pay the price for just following orders.


                
This movie is a great courtroom drama! It is interesting as it speaks of a very evil time of Nazi Germany. The plot of the movie is very well done, but this movie is about 30 minutes too long. Some "non-courtroom" scenes could easily be cut. I loved the cast in this movie. Which is always pretty much the most important factor determining the greatness of a particular movie.** SPOILER ALERT **As 4 judges of Nazi Germany are judged for their cooperation with Hitler's Nazi Germany, viewer himself can participate in observing his own opinion and how the prosecution and defense may sway his or her stand on the issue.The high point of the movie is the Janning (Lancester) taking a stand and giving a testimony about how he believes he actually is guilty.Overall a great movie. But not the easiest to watch due to it's length and some dull moments. A big minus for that.My real rating: 8.0MY RATING SYSTEM:9.4 - 10 = rating 10 ***** 8.9 - 9.3 = rating 9 ***** 8.4 - 8.8 = rating 8 ***** 7.9 - 8.3 = rating 77.4 - 7.8 = 6 7.0 - 7.3 = 5 6.0 - 6.9 = 4 5.0 - 5.9 = 3 4.0 - 4.9 = 2 1.0 - 3.9 = 1
