Personally I'm not the biggest fan of this style of animation that relies heavily on "easy" geometric shapes, but the 10 stories that make up Over the Garden Wall seem suited for the relatively simple adventures the brothers have as they try to find their way back home.Each episode works on its own, but more or less does pick up where the previous left off, and there is a story arc that runs over the entire set of episodes.Ideal for youngsters to get them to learn that not everything is what it may seem to be at first.


                
The characters and backgrounds are gorgeous and properly dark, and the animation is smooth as can be.The characters are hit or miss. Wirt is the straight man to all the ridiculousness that befalls him. He's awkward and clumsy, and often he is ignored by other characters until he starts following along with the weirdness, which becomes annoying.Greg is a quirky, borderline mentally retarded child, that the show tries to sell as adorable, but often causes problems for Wirt, which can also become annoying. A lot like Mabel from "Gravity Falls".Beatrice is the serious, genre savvy, comic relief. She's OK.The story of every episode is the random unexplained setting where crazy stuff happens, everyone does ridiculous things, and "issues" just resolve themselves by cheer dumb luck by the end of the episode.The overarching plot with the Beast is the most interesting part of it all.All in all it's an aesthetically lovely series, but it ends up feeling pretentious.
