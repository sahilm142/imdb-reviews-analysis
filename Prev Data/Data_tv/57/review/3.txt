Apart from the final episode (which actually is the only episode of Blackadder that is worth watching across the whole saga) this series isn't actually half as smart or as funny as it likes to think it is.It is in fact carried by a stellar performance from Rowan Atkinson, who at times is working very hard to make some not so sharp bits of the script work.I'm surprised I'm being so down about this show, because I'm a fan of Richard Curtis's writing, and also Rowan Atkinson, but somewhere along the way this show doesn't do a lot for me.Comedy is subjective, more so than any other genre perhaps, but for me this isn't one that'll be added to my 'best sitcom' list.
