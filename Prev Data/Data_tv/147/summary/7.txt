 what are the big little lies?

 Voting based on only ten minutes of an entire series

 Not bad but not superb like I was expecting after reading some reviews.

 True no matter what

 Hmmmmm?

 who edits

 definitely not a MYSTERY series

 The ending

 Great performances and beautiful photography lifts this series above the rather mundane plot

 "The essence of a marriage is the ability to pretend". West Coast trivial dribble marriage complaints from rich housewives, BUT it is directed and acted superbly.

 Not bad
