 Don't give up on this after Season 1

 Don't be Discouraged

 This show rocks

 Pretty good cop show

 best television series i have watched- talk about intensity !

 A truly great police drama that will keep you at the edge of your seat.

 Fantastic

 You may complain about the Shield ... however

 binge worthy bad cops show.

 Television excellence

 tense ,gritty but time to pull..The Shield

 comment for movieguy

 An intense and floundering overview of vices and virtues of LA street cops

 Most lovable corrupt gang unit EVER!

 Even For All of Its Racism, The Shield Is Entertaining

 No grits in that just blood and gore
