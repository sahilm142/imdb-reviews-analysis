 Preferred the 1st one then. Still prefer it now

 Not quite my cup of T

 A little over rated

 One Of The Better Sequels

 Good action movie, but strays too close to Terminator 1's formula

 Excellent movie, but not as good as the first movie

 Solid action movie with impressive effects, but not a standout where it counts

 'DONT put the kid in the picture...'

 Overrated

 A good action movie, but a few plot holes left made it weaker

 Its okay.

 Spectactular special effects-laden sci-fi action film

 Decent

 Nice Movie

 Come with me if you want to live!...

 A Childhood Favorite--Not As Good Now, Though

 A worthy sequel and pretty cool action movie

 "Good Sequel!"

 Good Terminator.....Bad Terminator!

 about as good as basic action movies get

 He Threw Ya From The Truck?

 movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger

 Opinion

 good sequel

 As far as the plot goes, I have two problems.
