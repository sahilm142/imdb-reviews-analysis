THIS MOVIE RUINED MY DAY."The Elephant Man" is about a man who was horribly deformed while still in his mother's womb. He was born deformed and because of this he has never been treated like a human being.The entire movie revolves around this deformed man being discovered and cared for by a doctor. The doctor and his contemporaries care for the deformed man throughout the movie but not once is he treated like a normal human being. The kindness that everybody, but a small few, show him is surface level nonsense.The movie is supposed to show how kindness and "love" turned this deformed mans life around. This would be true if the kindness and love were genuine. Unfortunately they were not.I strongly do not recommend this movie. It is about a miserable man who is mistreated and abused his entire life. Not once did I ever believe he was truly happy. This movie, right from the beginning, made me sad and I honestly wish I had never watched it.
