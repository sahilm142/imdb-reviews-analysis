I watched all 37 episodes. Yes, the show is extremely well made and extremely interesting. There is no doubt about that. However, about half way through i started getting a terrible feeling in my stomach. I could not tolerate watching what was unfolding on the screen. I started watching more episodes each day. Not so I could see what comes next. But rather so the show could finally end.Even the ending of this show is disgusting and serves no justice. The show is truly despicable, and people out there need to know both sides. I caution everyone out there. DO NOT trust the ratings. The high rating is because of how interesting, intriguing and well made this show is. It is not, however, a show you should watch.You will not feel anything but disgust at the end. You will not feel good. You will not feel, well, anything. You have been warned.


                
Why is L so annoying ? I don't like him at all. He disgusts me, but everything besides him is GREAT...


                
Starts off: Here are the notebook (deathnote) rules and this is what your story is based around. Story moves on writer thinks oh dear I've run out of ideas, I know, I'll add new rules. Started getting tiresome after about 15 episodes. E19 I gave up bored of the fact they couldn't stick to the bloody rules that they set and bored of the thing in general. This could have been a 12 episode masterpiece, it started great but after 19 episodes and not wanting to finish it, it means all that time was wasted. That this is rated more highly than Hunter X Hunter 2011 just doesn't make sense to me. SAO gets loads of flack but it was better than this. At least I could stick it to the end.


                
I liked the imagery, however I had great difficulty understanding the strange noises the characters were making.
