 Valid story from the Communist era

 Truth is stranger than fiction

 Good movie but something's missing...

 Great story and screenplay with less of the usual scene montages

 worth seeing but...

 typical

 A Masterwork Of Pristine Quality That Deserves A Broader Audience!

 The Wall

 The most overrated film of the latest Oscar.

 Voyeurs in the DDR.

 Not really convincing!

 How do you say 'overrated' in German

 Excellent base, mediocre story

 eyes to the floor..

 'The banality of evil' meets the insidiousness of applied state power.

 Moving

 Oscar???

 The Walls Have Ears.

 Tastefully done

 A Good Movie

 Realistic view of Socialist countries

 Das Leben der Anderen: Subtle But Touching

 over-rated but nice drama

 Very good movie with very few flaws

 Great stuff
