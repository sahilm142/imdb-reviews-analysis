I collected the comics when I was a kid, for twenty years, and seeing these movies is a bit of a downer. Sure the action is good and the CG is mostly great, but the story is nothing like the comics I collected. There are too many jokes. Too much humor. Too many characters that don't need to be there and where not there originally.I sat through the movie and enjoyed it for what it was, a visual fun fest. The story lacked depth. Thanos's desire to have all the stones and to destroy 50% of life was terrible because the real story wasn't told. The story they showed was a lie for the purpose of doing a cash grab.Again, for action it was awesome. It is fast paced and there is very little slow time in the movie. It is the script I didn't like.Sigh. I think I'll just stop watching movies. I think they, Hollywood, has forgotten how to make them great.


                
I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before. I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.


                
I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War. Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the "characters" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and cliché There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.


                
Movie was good until the ending. Absolutely sucked. I would have much rather had them make a 4-5 hour movie than have them leave it like they did. After that ending I'm not sure I care to watch anymore Marvel movies. And if I do ever watch more of them I'll wait until they're on Redbox or at my local library so that way I don't have to pay an arm and a leg to potentially suffer this kind of disappointment from a movie again.


                
SPOILER ALERT!!
I am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat. Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still...The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea. Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing.This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors.The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that. I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right?I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.
Merely 5% is real life images, the rest were virtual. The story unconnected, boring, the end surprisingly unended, to be continued... it doesn't deserve the 9 star rating, who paid it?


                
If you get your thrills watching the Avengers get their butt kicked, seeing at least two die, and enjoy the villian being the star of an entire movie, this film is for you! Plus throw in an almost non existent Hulk, a Thor with no hammer (he does get an axe towards the end of the movie), Captain America with a kids toy shield and no mask, and a basically worthless Vision, we'll, you get it. I know this a two-parter and a lot of what happened will be rectified, but it was still a huge disappointment to me. Did enjoy some of the hero pairings and the humor was mostly funny, but it wasn't nearly enough for me.
Warning: spoilers.There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.
Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the "end result"?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.
The director has just spaffed action scenes in one after the other in a confusing non-chronological order.
Anyone who knows Marvel will expect more and anyone who doesn't will be confused.


                
Hated Star Lord from start to finish, Way too many characters to follow, Way too many storylines happening at once, The characters that died (minus Loki and Heimdall who I cried over) I didnt feel sad over because we only seen them in a few movies and didnt know them that well. For some reason all the phase one characters didnt die it would have made more sense if they died.
I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite. I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden. The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked. They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora. Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long. If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story. I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first? I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:"I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10? But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?


                
If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. 
There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. 
Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.
Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.
Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.


                
I saw this film the Thursday it came out and I wanted to see if what everyone was saying was true and it wasn't. I'm gonna go through the thing I thought were good and bad.
Good:
#1 CGI, visuals
The CGI in this film was really, really good. aside from a couple shots of Thanos the CGI was basically perfect. The CGI on Thanos made him look like an actual big purple man. Even getting little facial expressions and markings on his face that other company's wouldn't care to put the detail in for. The visuals in the film made everything look really interesting and gave the film some eye candy all throughout.
#2 Thanos 
I would still say Loki from the first Avengers was better than Thanos but damn Thanos in this film was relentless and intimidating. Though I didn't care for his motivation, he was much better than Ultron mainly because Thanos never spit out any dumb and painfully unfunny humor.
#3 Characters (I liked) and character interactions
The only characters in the film I liked were: Iron Man, Hulk (or more appropriately Bruce Banner ) , Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Thor, and Thanos. I've already talked about Thanos so I'll talk about the others. The Interactions between Peter, Tony, and Strange were probably one of the best parts of the movie. They were actually kind of funny and were really entertaining. Thor's interactions between the Guardians were good. I didn't find it funny but it was entertaining.
#4 Action
The action was really entertaining and fun. It was creative and done really well. and of course it looked great. There was only one shot of shaky cam and it such a bad shot I literally couldn't see anything.
Bad Things
#1 Pacing
The pacing in the first act wasn't very good. every time it cut to a new group of people the film was just frantically trying to catch up with itself. It gets better in the second and third but but every time it cut to the Guardians the film just came to a grinding halt.
#2 Humor 
Humor is subjective, I know that. but the humor in the film was painfully unfunny and it wasn't made all that better by the crowd laughing every ten seconds in the theater.
#3 Character deaths and other characters
All the other characters I didn't care for mainly because they either did one thing or nothing. I get that a film with this big of a cast can't include everyone, but damn, to many characters did nothing, they were kind of just their. It's not all the better by the fact that most of the characters that died were characters that did nothing. All the original Avengers were left alive, and I feel like it would've been better if they killed at least one or two of them. the character deaths also weren't that heartbreaking or sad. Some just died and the Film moved on. The only death I cared for was Spider-Man cause he actually had a scene that was at least a little bit sad.
#4 Romances
The romances were just terrible. Wanda and Visions romance was just extremely awkward that was also accompanied with terrible dialogue. The romance between Bruce and Black Widow came back for one or two lines of dialogue and it's literally never acknowledged again.
#5 Gamora's death.
This has a section of it's own because of how horribly obvious it was. It actually amazes me that people were surprised that she died. after she said a line to Star-Lord about killing her if Thanos catches her I instantly knew that she was going to die. and what do you know she died about 30 minutes later. I personally feel it would've been more effective if she started begging Peter to kill her when she actually got captured.
#6 Star-Lord 
His entire character was ruined for me. At a point in the film when Thanos is pinned down and they almost have the infinity gauntlet off him and Peter decides to hit Thanos in the face waking him up and thus dooming half the universe. It felt extremely out of character and I thought it would've been better if Drax did it. Thanos did destroy his planet and his family so shouldn't he do it. He is more of a loose canon and Peter is more logical. You might say he didn't attack him because he knew it was a bad idea and he didn't attack him earlier. But that's because Thanos had his guard up and would've easily destroyed him. So, Star- Lord killed everybody.
#7 Wanda (Scarlet Witch)
For my last section I would like to talk about Wanda. She could've easily defeated Thanos because of how powerful she is. There's a point on the Wakanda battlefield where five giant rolling saws are released and she comes out and destroys them instantly. And if she has the power to destroy an infinity stone she should be in battle killing everything.
In conclusion this film is massively overrated and shouldn't be the 15th best film of all time according to Imdb. This is a 4/10.
I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze. The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main "computer constructed" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face. It is a fast based movie with few "quiet" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references. ********** SPOILER Begin**************
There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. 
********** SPOILER end**************Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie. At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a "relief" and ended to be an "art".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.
I was really excited to watch this third Avengers movie, being that they were going all in with both the Avengers and the Guardian characters but ultimately the movie is just one big mess of a movie. The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.


                
It's not a horrible movie but I don't get the point of super hero fight scenes anymore, they are just a distraction. It was kind of ridiculous Dr Strange handing over his stone at the end but at the same time it's like 'whatever, you'll get the stone anyways'. I wish the battles would have taken place in heavily populated areas so that the aimless fighting would have destroyed cities and populations.No super heros really seem to have very unique of powers or skills anymore as well, at least none that really make a tactical advantage.Guardians of the Galaxy were the best part (and probably Thor even though he was even more ridiculous) where they have at least some personality but in the end they were brought into the world of silly super hero battles.
I am superheroes and sci-fi fan. I have watched every single Marvel superhero movies. I found the previous ones especially the old ones like Iron man 1-3, Captain America and Thor series well-designed in story-line and also logical. But Infinity War is nothing like one of those. It felt rushed together and senseless. Each hero just "feed" themselves to Thanos one by one after showing off their coolest abilities. Loki as a trickster decided to go one on one face to face with Thanos. You can argue that he tried his best and didnt wanna go quietly into the night. Its heroic but also foolish and it 's simply not something loki would do in my opinion. The war happened in Wakanda. The people mastered laser surgery on infinity stone and the best shield barrier technology i have ever seen but still use spears as their main weapon. The war scene looked a lot like one of the star war movies. And the best part is they decided to open the barrier to protect Vision for his laser surgery, which didnt work at all btw. Well, if you know its Vision they are after, why dont you put the barrier around him instead of forcing to open the barrier. And where were the air support? It looks a lot cooler to go melee against melee with aliens. My dear Winter Soldier is completely useless in this movie even though he got his arm back but only knows how to shoot with M4 and keep getting one-shotted. Why not cast Ant-man instead then? Why wasting precious scene on him just because his buddy is symbol of USA? Not to mention, when Thanos at his weakest, Peter Quill who is so-called guardian of the galaxy paid no attention with the gloves which contains the most important objects in the Universe and key to winning the war but focusing on asking where his girlfriend is and wake up Thanos, who was under control of his teammates. How dare you ask "did we lose"? Its so ironic that Thor who had millions of combat in him 1500 year of life decided to aim his newly-made axe to the chest of Thanos. I mean did you see the shining armor he's wearing? Can you please cut his hand off or "go for the head" or play around with your teammates and not showing off with your weapon at last after teammates are down and lose the war. The movie is full of flaws like these. Thanos is well-fed with each one of our be-loved heroes and grew from quite strong into unstoppable. Good game and well played, guys!
Well, major spoiler bellow, bewareI have mixed feelings towards this movie. I could have given it at least extra three points if it weren't for its cheep, underdeveloped ending!All of a sudden, Gamora, Black Panther, Falcon, Star Lord, Groot, Mantis, Drax, Dr. Strange, and Spider Man all die!! I mean, most of these characters have huge potential (BP, Dr. Strange), rising stars (Guardians of the Galaxy), and Spiderman!!! WTF?? Even their deaths were really cheap and missing sufficient drama for such a HUGE turn in Marvel's track! When Wolverine died, it took them an entire movie to develop his death story, not a few minutes of meaningless finger snap! Not to mention Loki who died in the opening scene in such an undeveloped incidentWhat I expect, which would be even cheaper, is that some of the protagonists in the next movie will get the Time Gem and reverse the events and revive the deceased superheroes. Quite cliche'ish and cheap, if it wasOverall, the movie had much much bigger potential with such a plethora of Marvel superheroes and villains. Unfortunately Marvel rushed the story to fit it into the available time slot. Splitting it into two movies, with more time and elaboration to the same story would have made it a true classic, plus a better crafted ending!Overal: Dissapointed
Don't get me wrong. I love the Marvel Universe. I even went back to watch the original Iron Man and forgot that in those days, Disney didn't have their mitts on it yet. It was a Paramount movie. My how times have changed.For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's "The Last Jedi". Pretty to look at, but empty everywhere else.


                
There are movies that have a lot of car chases and explosions and stunts and special effects, but the story is weak and contrived. This movie is kind of like that. It's crap with star power. I will say that it was cool to see so many heroes in a single movie, and there were good special effects and lots of explosions. But, geez, the plot was so weak and contrived!This is what I call "dumbed down" writing as found in Maverick, a 1994 western about a gambler in a poker tournament. The buy in per player was $25k! In today's money, that's about half a million dollars, for the buy in, not the prize!
DUMB! The writers knew this, why not fix it? Because they think people are too dumb to understand that $1k was a huge amount in the Old West, so they dumb down the writing for them. I hated this, and it ruined that movie. A:IW commits the same sin, more than once.First, consider the Infinity Stones -- 6 stones created at the Big Bang of the Universe with unmatched power, supposedly. Yet 2 of them belong to Earth heroes? (Vision and Dr. Strange). And the rest all seem to be in our corner of this one relatively small galaxy. With more than a billion trillion stars in the Universe, this is STUPID.Next, let's consider Thanos' motivation. He grew up on a planet where overpopulation led to collapse of civilization, so now he is on a crusade to ride the Universe of overpopulation by killing exactly 50% of the people Universe. Does anyone else think this is too idiotic? I mean, sure, people on a planet with no space travel and limited technology might overpopulate that planet to the point of self-destruction, but, like, the Universe is full of empty space and empty planets. Like, billions, maybe trillions, of empty planets. And under-population can cause societal collapse, too, right? Insufficient genetic variation and such. Oh, and overpopulation is often a self-correcting problem because as resources get more scarce, people fight more over them and kill each other off.
Not pretty, but effective and largely unavoidable. Thanos' motivation is so stupid that, in fact, one would expect the other characters who discussed the motive to note the stupidity, BUT THEY DON'T! Everyone acts like it is reasonable if cold and heartless. NO IT'S NOT REASONABLE!!!If you really want to know how dumb this is, consider that the human population doubles about every 60 years. Assuming our growth is average for other intelligent species in the Universe, that means Thanos literally just set back the "problem" of Universal overpopulation by 60 years. And I think he spent hundreds or thousands of years on this master plan? Anyone see the problem? Bueller?Next, the plot is based on the fact of how infinitely powerful these six stones are, so any hero with just one of them is thereby one of the most powerful superheroes of all. With only 2 stones, Thanos lays out the Hulk with one punch -- the Hulk who held his own against Thor (and then some) in Ragnarok. Then with 3 stones, Thanos defeats the GOTG the blink of an eye. Then with 4 stones... he suddenly has trouble against Iron Man and Starlord? with three stonesBut later, when Thanos has 4 stones, he has trouble knocking out Iron Man, Spiderman and Dr. Strange? And after getting all 6 stones, we learn Thor could have defeated him if he went for a head-blow with his new axe? (The axe trumps 6 stones? Why was Thanos not collecting these axes instead?!)Next, everyone hero Thanos fought, it was like he had a man-crush on him, gushing how much he respected him. Over & over & over. A transparent attempt to explain away Thanos -- the most ruthless and villainous person in the Universe -- sparing hero after hero (until the very end when he wipes out half the universe, thereby setting back overpopulation by 60 years).It makes no sense for Thanos to spare these heroes he could easily kill in fight after fight after fight. He spares Thor (twice), spares Iron Man, spares the Guardians of the Galaxy at least once, spares almost every hero he encounters in Wakanda. Dumb/fake.Next, it is a common flaw in most of these "multiple superhero" movies for the authors to complete punt on any logic to the relative strength and power of the respective heroes. I mean, Captain America is basically just a human juiced up to be, maybe, 10 times stronger than a normal person? That leaves him about a thousand (or maybe a million?) times weaker than Thor or the Hulk or Iron Man. And don't get me started on Hawkeye and Black Widow -- totally normal humans who happen to have some martial art skills. Yet in Age of Ultron with a horde of metal robots patterned off Iron Man's technology, somehow every single one of them is pretty much equally kicking ass. In reality, Hawkeye and Black Widow should have been killed by the first robot they encountered, and Captain America would have been killed shortly thereafter.To see a variety of comic book heroes fighting side by side despite their different power levels, we have to accept this kind of inconsistency. Fine, to a point. IMO, the Avengers movies up to this point did an okay job not going too far ignoring the reality of the power differentials of their heroes. But this movie chucked any realism out the window, then ran outside and pissed on it. We are to believe one of Thanos' top aides -- the woman with the horns -- has trouble defeating a human with no powers just some martial arts skills (Black Widow)? And sure, maybe Captain America is 10 times stronger than a regular human, but Thanos' four-armed, fang-toothed soldiers looked at least 10 times stronger than a regular human, too, so Captain America should not have been decimating them like he was Superman. Oh, yeah, in a big budget Hollywood movie, the "hero" can always effortless defeat an infinite horde of faceless creatures, without any explanation needed.With all the repetition of how infinitely powerful the six stones are together -- so strong Thanos can kill half the universe instantaneously with just a thought! -- how is it that some space dwarf can forge an axe that can take him down? By the same token, if the six stones are each infinitely powerful, how can one human O.D. on gamma rays or build a metal suit of armor & suddenly be a power match for some one with an infinity stone? (recall he Hulk having his way with Loki when Loki had an infinity stone in his staff)In fact, Iron Man's power is just plain stupid because from GOTG we know humans are, like, thousands of years behind in their technology. So even if Stark was a visionary building Iron Man's suit well ahead of Earth technology, that might mean it is 50 years ahead, still thousands of years behind those space-traveling alien races. I mean, to Thanos, Stark's technology must be like the steam engine is to us... Yet Stark can go toe-to-toe with Thanos? Makes no sense.Next, a common stupidity in superhero fighting in general: If a hero has near invulnerability, like Hulk, Thor, (or villains like Thanos), so that they might fall thousands of feet, crash into the ground, and then just get up and brush themselves off, then it necessarily follows that pickup on a giant piece of the ground and smashing it into that person will not hurt him either. Writers often act as if an object ,that would not hurt a superhero who flew into it, WILL hurt the hero if thrown at that hero by an enemy. No, no, no! If Superman can fly into the a train at 500 mph and not get hurt, then a villain picking up said train and throwing it at Superman at 500 mph cannot hurt him either. In effect, this fact would make fights between these near invulnerable heroes pointless and boring, so writers ignore this, but it still is dumbed down writing.Getting away from general superhero movie criticisms, and back to this movie, a lot of the scenes were just not that fulfilling. When some of the heroes managed to put Thanos to sleep and were about to remove his infinity gauntlet, Starlord suddenly starts hitting Thanos and demanding he tell him what happened to Gematria, so he wakes up before the gauntlet is removed.
Dude, with half the population of the Universe at risk, you can't hold yourself back from interrogating him just 60 seconds till the gauntlet is off??? Then you can waterboard Thanos all you want for information!!! Seriously? The writers want me, as an audience member, to feel satisfied with that story line? STUPID WRITING!!!Almost as bad was the defeat of Thanos crony who controlled metal like Magneto. They blow a hole in the ship wall and he's sucked into space. Seriously? Can't he just use his power to float some metal to him, grab it, and then float it back into the ship like a buoy? Or maybe float the whole metal ship to himself? Or just seal up the metal hull of the ship before he gets to it? It seemed like the most lazy way to resolve that fight, not even trying to be clever or believable. Why not have the bad guy slip on a banana peel and hit his head, just as original and plausible.Should we ponder again how Thanos with 2 stones easily beats Hulk, Hulk beats Thor (in Ragnarok), and Thor at the end is just about a match for Thanos with 6 stones? This will never make sense, and it is lazy and poorly thought out writing.
I'm a huge fan of the MCU, and the past few movies have been incredible. The build up to this movie was unprecedented, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype. There were a few funny moments, and the characters had equal and balanced amounts of screen time. However, that's where any positive comments I could make about this movie end. Every plot line that had been built in the last phase of movies was destroyed in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Some of the romantic subplots seemed to come out of nowhere or at the very least lacked significant, on-screen build up. One of the worst things about the movie was how easy it was for Thanos to find the infinity stones. It was so easy to collect them, anyone could have done it. Thanos could have done it ages ago. Why wait for something that was so simply accomplished? From what the movie shows us, he finds them in a matter of days, with only one stone posing any real challenge to find. Thanos also lacks real motivation as a character. He doesn't desire any acknowledgment, any material possession, or any power for wiping out half the universe. It felt like something pivotal to the story had been removed (which, from my understanding of the comics, was actually the case). It also seemed pretty convenient that at the end of the movie, the heroes left standing were the same boring, dried up characters whose stories were long over before this movie (looking at you, Iron Man). I've been following these movies for a long time, and the other Avengers movies were disappointing, but this was the last straw for me.
Ok, I know there will be a sequence... and if is so bad as this one I don't wanna watch!!
I like superhero movies as entertainment, but some, like Dr. Strange, have something more... The first Avengers was so boring that it was the first movie I slept almo all over... This one I didn't, but now I think it'd be better if I did...
Of course I hated that everyone that matters died, but, it wasn't just that, this was only the rotted cherry of one big bad cake! 
The worst part was that everyone who had great power did the opposite of what they use to do, and here is the inconsistency....Worse, we're subjected to a farce, where Thanos can pulverize the Hulk and Thor (who has chosen to not use lightning for no apparent reason at all) in 3 seconds, but Captain America can hold his fist open for nearly ten seconds. 
Where Dr. Strange absolutely no, sorry but, cannot, ever, hand over that time-stone, but apparently sees no particular need to jump back in time and maybe reverse being on that ship in the first place? (Maybe even *gasps* turn back time until Starlord does not punch Thanos in the face? Or, why not trap Thanos in the sort of time-loop he used last time at the end of his movie? If I, a plebeian audience, can think of this, why can't Strange?).
Where everyone tries to pull off Thanos' glove, and no one thinks of putting his arm through one of those yellow-Strange-portal thingys and chopping said arm off, which we know worked perfectly well on Thanos' kid. 
Where Loki, who can survive falling off the Bifrost and through space, apparently decides trying to stab Thanos with a dagger makes more sense than taking Thor and jumping out a window and letting the vacuum of space kill everyone on Thanos' side who *can* be killed by that, since it's been a fact since he fell off the Bifrost that both he and Thor are immune to dying in space. 
Worse!!! Where Heimdall teleports Hulk back to earth, because apparently Hulk is more important than the King??? I will not even get started on poor Steve, Wanda, and Vision's arcs, or Starlord's. All I will say is that it IS trading lives if you trade 10,000 foot-soldier's lives for one Vision, and Starlord might be shallow but he DOES have a brain.That´s why if the second part keeps this pace of this bad, bad plot... I'll never more watch one movie of this franchise.
I am a big fan of Marvels, but this movie was a crushing disappointment. The effects was great, and......... that's it. 
The movie made no sense, you'll be mostly trying to figure out what's going on even after it's done. What a disappointment!! It honestly hurts.
After watching Black Panther, I was so pumped up, looking forwards to watching this film, just to get a smashing let down!
I'm actually afraid of watching the next Avengers. SO crushing it is! OUCH!!


                
I guess I will be dissenting reviewer here among the many other apparent glowing reviews here.I have watched the various Marvel movies and in particular the Avengers series released over the last 5 years. This one has got Marvel heroes and villains raining in left right and centre from the start with limited background or story to set the scene. The comedy in the face of apparent disaster seemed misplaced.And I have to say it has probably got the most anticlimactic ending ever. I won't go into the details to avoid spoilers for those of you have not watched it yet. However i appreciate this was probably to get people to watch the next movie. But myself and the rest of the viewers in the theatre i was at today was shocked at this abrupt ending with little meaning or explanation. Was not impressed hence the 4 rating.


                
The ending left everyone wondering what they had just wasted 2 hours of their life on. The first half was very good!
