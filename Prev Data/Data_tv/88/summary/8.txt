 An epic series, in more ways than one.

 I Really Wanted To Believe

 A good show that lasted to long.

 Into or out

 There is nothing like this, but it is not untouchable

 One smart show!

 "I want to believe"

 Frighteningly entertaining

 better than memory served

 X-Files stands the test of time. Easily!

 season 10 and 11 not matching expectations

 The Truth is Out There- That this Show is Amazing!

 X-way!

 One of televisions finest completely original and most importantly very well made.

 Best of the best...

 Just wasn't the same without Mulder

 A series that marked a decade

 good clean fun for television

 Brilliant sci-fi drama for brave folks

 Could be total great but it is "just" great:)
