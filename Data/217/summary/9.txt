 A Masterpiece of Animated Cinema

 Idealistic, but not naive

 A magnificent imaginative movie.

 This impressive work from acclaimed Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki represents a significant departure from traditional anime.

 Wow.

 A Somewhat-Flawed Yet Truly-Inspiring Masterpiece from the Mind of Miyazaki

 Best anime ever.

 To everyone who loves Princess Mononoke

 I love this movie.

 Always original ideas

 Why wasn't this the film to introduce North America to anime?

 This movie is a Gem

 Can Miyazaki make a boring film? I don't think so.

 Very good

 One of the best adventure films I have ever watched!

 Excellent Studio Ghibli Film

 Worth watching!

 Filled with stunning animation and an engaging story with memorable characters, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a triumph for Japanese animation.

 A masterpiece for all generations

 A Miyazaki Must-See For All Fans - A Masterpiece
