 Wolf of Wall Street

 The Wolf of Hollywood!

 sometimes hilarious

 Excessive Excess

 Great movie but endless!!

 Disappointment, but it was to be expected

 Excess living depicted through excess film making... Over-hyped Film

 Great movie-making, DiCaprio astonishes...but it's a bit all the same, all the time

 Not Marty's best work, more flash than substance

 HK Auteur film review - The Wolf of Wall Street

 A shorter and denser version would have been so much better

 Not perfect, but good

 Under par Scorsese overacted by Di Caprio

 The Wolf of Wall Street is among Scorsese's best

 Not as good as expected

 A Hysterical Ride, But A Little More Depth Wouldn't Have Caused Any Harm!

 The Wolf of Wall Street was a pretty crazy movie. Not, only did it sell the pen. The dark comedy concept sold the movie.

 Fast, loud and morally ambiguous: the Scorcese way

 Even when you have everything, you still want more

 Good direction, bad editing

 Great fictional work from Hollywood

 Some movies simply have to be pleasing

 A fun movie, no much more than that

 A Maddeningly Ferocious Genre Of Cinema. <U+2666> 70%

 enjoyable, but not a masterpiece
