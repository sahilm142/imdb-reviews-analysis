 money, money, money...

 Gold Fever and Greedy Fools

 Good, but not up to the hype

 The Treasure of the Sierra Madre

 Huston and Huston Search for Gold

 Good old movie

 Great performance in an average movie

 Not a REAL western.

 The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) ***

 remember.. Some of the most evil deeds come from decent men when gold is involved

 Not really the great classic I expected but it's still good all.

 Overrated, But Still Interesting To Watch

 The Treasure of the Sierra Madre

 Bogart's best

 Nothing like a good ol' treasure hunt

 Well played drama about a couple of down-and-out American's...

 Still has something vital to say!

 does it really matter who you are when you are in search for "wealth"?
