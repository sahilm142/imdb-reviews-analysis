 A Truly Cinematic Cartoon

 A Godsend for American Animation

 Subtly brilliant

 Long Ago In A Distant Land...

 A brilliant production on every level.

 Superb!

 Brilliant, magnificent, imaginative, stunning, funny... Way too many adjectives left...

 The Age of the Samurai has returned...

 Amazing. Anyone who doesn't love it is blind

 If Kurasawa directed a cartoon, SAMURAI JACK would be it

 Best 2000s animated show ever

 This show is the Father I never had

 Gets better further in

 The Samurai Called Jack

 Making the Cut

 Jack's back!

 Something cartoon creators should look up for.

 An excellent series

 Fantastic, Gritty and Brilliant

 Visually impressive, artistic, dark...but just a bit dull

 Perfect for a film adaptation!

 If they could just end it..IT would have been a much greater MASTERPIECE than it is now!!!

 A Simple Drawing Meets With Cinematography, Presented by Tartakovsky

 A Beautiful, Exciting and Deeply Touching piece of Art - Childhood Grownup

 Season 5 is next level stuff. Currently the best show on television
