 The Dark Knight Rises review which is tedious and overstretched and over-hyped and chaotic, matching the style of the movie

 Wait !! There must something wrong with me !!

 Very poor movie

 serious...so annoyed

 10/10 for the hype and marketing. Movie however....

 An over zealous and over budget conclusion to what could have been a classic trilogy

 The Dark Knight Plummets

 Terrible Film

 For Pete's sake, Chris - enough already.

 The Dark Knight Falls - Completely and utterly

 Dark Knight Rises? More like sinks.

 Boring Boring BORING!!!!!!!!!!

 The plot holes of a Three Stooges skit and the ending of Scooby Doo.

 Very disappointed

 This depressing and shallow mess is officially a disappointment of epic proportions

 Wait for the DVD

 Cheap Compilation of Trailers

 I Don't Understand

 So bad I had to open a window to let the smell out.....

 Awful, laughable... Shows that Nolan is only human

 i waisted my time .. where is batman ?

 Feeble

 A Terrible Ending to An Already Terrible Series

 Ugh...

 Holy Cr@pshoot, Batman!
