 An incredibly beautiful-looking film as one would expect with director Ridley Scott<U+0085>

 Release version was better

 "All these moments wiil be lost in time, like tears in the rain".

 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

 Well-paces, Stylish, Iconic, Intense, Excellent all-around.

 A Triumph of Style of Substance

 A chilling, bold, mesmerizing, futuristic detective thriller.

 'They Don't Advertise For Killers In The Newspaper'

 A Dick's Lament

 A cyberpunk and mystery sci-fi thriller all in one

 Created Universe is a Wonderful

 Watch it because it's a classic.

 A gem of a Science Fiction film.

 WOnerdrful Riddley movie

 Falls short of Philip K. Dick's brilliant novel

 Style over substance - 1:0

 It could have been made yesterday!

 Never been there. Never done that.

 Easily Stands The Test Of Time,

 Where Did I Come From ? Where Am I Going ? How Long Have I Got ?

 Surprising, exciting, inconsistent: Blade Runner.

 Underrated sci-fi classic. Cool and flashy and memorable photography and scenes.

 Maybe I'm missing something... *minor spoilers, clearly marked and confined to a single paragraph*

 A dystopian noir done well

 Very good
