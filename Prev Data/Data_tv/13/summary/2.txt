 The best in animated storytelling...

 A Statement On Perfection. True Unequaled Bliss.

 I just rewatched the best TV series in the history of the world

 Well done

 Very Great story

 A great show for Nick, and it's about time!

 Avatar: The Last Airbender

 I'm overly impressed

 A show that could surpass Cartoon Network's Samurai Jack.

 The best show Nickelodeon has aired

 Everyone should watch this, and if you don't, you're a monster

 Best Cartoon on Television

 I could never forget.

 Fake anime can be good

 Easily one of (if not THE) greatest animated shows of our time.

 Not just for kids

 Not just for kids

 Great anime style toon from Nick

 The one show/piece of art that hasn't and never will be topped by anything.

 A light of hope for Nickelodeon

 Finally, some decent American programming. It's been too long.

 An incredibly good show?

 It's 2018 and I still watch this show

 A show I will rewatch forever
