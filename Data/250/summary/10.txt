 A Stunning Surprise

 A New Hope

 Really good

 The most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date

 The best superhero movie I've ever seen

 They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy.

 Amazing!

 The most fascinating, fun and exciting movie I've ever seen!

 Great Motley Crew

 Simply Marvel-lous

 Best Movie.....Ever (seriously)

 Marvelous Recognition

 Marvel's Space Opera

 Guardians of the Galaxy Imax 3D experience

 "I'll die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy"

 a very stunning work

 Can be the best Marvel movie ever made than The Avengers

 A Star Wars for today

 Drop everything and go see it right now. If already seen, see it again.

 Overwhelmingly brilliant...

 alien females acting too much like women on earth

 Greatness of the galaxy

 Better than the Avengers

 A sublime assault on the senses, easily the biggest hit of the summer

 I Was Not Disappointed
