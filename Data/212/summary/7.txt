 Excellent Storytelling But Flawed

 Good, but I didn't get much out of it

 Three stories, one great, one good, one bad

 Mexico shows its face

 Not a bad effort...but not up to expectations

 Amores Perros

 Three Vignettes Were Two Too Many

 Although very well done, the cinema of sadism is objectionable

 Over-rated movie which has limited entertainment for average movie goers

 Great interweaving of strong stories

 Distinctive, realistic, but unsteady pace

 A culture of violence, devoid of compassion

 An Interesting Take on Love

 An Absorbing, Gritty, Metaphorical, Relentless, Transitional and Unsettling Drama That Pulls You Into A World Fumed By Rage

 Excelente!

 So-so Mexican film

 Superior Foreign Latin Movie

 A technically well crafted film about unlikable people.

 A slightly overrated tale of human struggle.

 Love, life and everything in between.

 Good story....

 Sonata of Savagery

 Amores Perros: 7/10

 Nice film that's certainly worth your time

 Alright, but somewhat quickly forgotten
