 One of the scariest movies ever---8/10

 "I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years & not all of them good." A great horror film.

 One of the best horror movies ever made with exceptional performance by Jack Nicholson and stunningly directed by Stanley Kubrick

 Whoever said horror only happens when it's dark?

 Here's My Shining Review

 Stanley Kubrick's epic nightmare of horror

 "A tremendous sense of Isolation"

 Stanley Kubrick directing techniques and styles showcased in a precise and acute manner.

 Chilling in more ways than one

 Nicholson makes you forget that it barely resembles the book

 A Horror Classic

 stanley + kubrick = horror legend

 Fails a little for a horror flick, but still a pretty good job by Kubrick

 Peep This Reviews

 one of the best adaptations of Stephen King books

 Profound

 I wish we could stay here forever... and ever... and ever...

 The best madness

 Delightfully Chilly.

 Not a masterpiece

 Scary Images, Creepy Tone
