 Fine Cast & Production

 A testament with the wrong moral..

 A Memorable Film Of Its Era, 'The Grapes Of Wrath' Is A Deserving John Ford Classic.

 An account of people trapped in the cage of poverty and misery !!!

 A powerful film based on a powerful book.

 Review for History of Cinema

 For a Variety of Viewers

 Good, but not quite Steinbeck

 HIST American Film

 Something wrong with the movie

 The Grapes of Wrath

 The grapes of wrath

 Good film, terribly dense/heavy - boring

 Good Attempt

 No home, no job, no peace, no rest

 A fight for a better life...

 "I'd pray for folks that's alive and don't know which way to turn."
