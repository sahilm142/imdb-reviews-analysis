 Just go and enjoy the roller coaster thriller

 A wonderful suspense movie.

 Refreshing concept but not perfect

 You see?

 Good Screenplay but away from reality

 Very good movie

 hooked me to seat till the climax

 Class Thriller

 Clever and fully entertaining crime story

 Fantastic movie.

 Deceiving or rather a pretentious!?

 Keeps a different textures

 Ayushman n tabu.. just woww

 Nice Movie but with hard to catch ending

 A fine blend of crime, thriller and comedy

 Best ever bollywood thriller

 What is life ? It all depends on the liver.

 If you're a big thriller fan you have to watch the movie , at least the first half(both spoolier less and spoiler review)

 Good story and screenplay

 Great combination of dark humor and thriller

 One of the best thrilling movies

 Superb movie

 The blind's vision

 Great thriller after Johny gaddar
