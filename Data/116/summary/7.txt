 What's all the fuss? It's just OK

 Batman: Teasing Begins

 Good direction for future installments

 This is not another superhero movie

 I am amazed that I liked it...

 Works at its best, when it isn't a batman film.

 The best Batman movie of them all

 Great Story. Finally Batman backs.

 A Better Batman

 Delightfully Dark

 Excellent revamping, surpasses the other installments

 Good Beginning...

 A diamond in the ruff, Batman Begins pays homage to the dark origins of the Dark Knight and to all action/ thriller movies

 A truly impressive comic hero come to life

 Enjoyable, but not memorable

 If cinemas had sofa's as we would be hiding behind them, and as Batman Begins flies onto our screens

 A fresh start for a franchise that desperately deserved it

 The best Batman movie ever!!!

 The Best Batman Film!

 They did it ! Thanks !

 Batman succeeds at being Batman

 Very good...but something's missing.

 Great, fast, myth-making, beautifully filmed...a Nolan movie about Batman

 Well worth a look

 The best Batman ever... is still the cartoon. But this still beats nearly all the live-action versions.
