Based up reviews on IMDb I purchased a copy of Babam Ve Oglum from Turkey with English subtitles. It was not, as hyped, "One of the best movies ever." Instead, it was a poorly done, trite melodrama that I forced myself, and I mean FORCED myself to watch for about 35 minutes. I'll admit, one does take a chance when he buys based upon the recommendations of other IMDb users, but sometimes the risk is worth the reward. I suspect that the movie was "ramped" up by users in order to increase its appeal, and it certainly caught my interest due to its seemingly high ratings. But let's not be fooled. The $30 I spent for this title, yes $30!, was a complete waste of money. Usually I will try to resell those purchases I make on Amazon and Ebay that don't meet my expectations, but in this case the movie was so poor that I threw it into the trash, not desiring to foist the same foolish film on others. My warning: stay away from this movie at all costs, even if it is offered to you for free!


                
JUST for those who KNOW why Godfather is a great movie: this movie was amateur and stupid, So exaggerated. Please don't waste your time as I did. I encourage you to watch "Children of Heaven (1997)" instead.


                
Am I the only one here who finds this movie pathetic?
Full of cliché and overacting.. total waste of time. Sorry..
