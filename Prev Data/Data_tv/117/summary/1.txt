 A Testament to the Unraveling of American Morals

 A major disappointment

 Was Good and Funny....Now political!!!

 Empty entertainment lacking emotion, humor and convincing characters

 Used to be good

 Shameless IS a SHAME!!

 Not worth it

 Just plain sad

 Another great show ruined by an American remake

 Pathetic way to attract attention of audience

 Shameless is aimless and depressing. Low class show.

 Absolute rubbish

 Awful Unnecessary Regurgitation

 Absolutely Awful...Everything that's wrong with the US is here!

 Just a great disappointment, good actors wasted on drivel.

 terrible with lower case puke...

 Great run, pathetic wind-up to me (S7 E2)

 Disheartening

 Really bad idea.

 Not a patch on the original.

 Horrible...

 WHY bugga up the original ????

 Done with shameless

 Word to your value!

 The Series Title Says It All
