 A Beautiful Space Fantasy

 the Rolling Stones of outer space

 Pelvic sorcery saves the galaxy

 Blech!

 Proof that not all superhero films need to be "gritty and realistic"

 I'm not in love

 I regret not watching it earlier

 One of the Best Sci-Fi of this Year

 Worth seeing...but #37?

 First review

 Marvel Studios' Biggest Gamble To Date... That Pays Off Tremendously Well.

 The Trailer gave a Rising Eyebrow but The Movie was Everything I Hoped For

 Maybe the most fun of any comic book movie

 Fun, funny, fantastic. Marvel's best to date? Bring on the sequel!

 A triumph of original sci-fi with a giant dose of humour..

 An Entertaining 2 Hours!

 Marvel Studios does an A Team film (except it's good)

 One of the best that a scifi/action films could offer! // instagram: moviesmaniac

 A good movie

 it is so nice film

 Entertaining movie, a good watch

 A Hilarious Paint by numbers Superhero movie!

 If you want a fun film to watch this summer, Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely the right choice!

 Not Bunch of A-Holes

 Very entertaining and funny, great main characters, and awesome story only lacks in the villains and the final fight
