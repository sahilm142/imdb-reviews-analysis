I wanted to like this show, as quite a few things were nicely set up. The atmosphere, camera work, the scenery and the acting as well. But all these efforts unfortunately went down with the script. The suspense is there, but unfortunately dies a long and uneventful death. The ending is no surprise and there's a lot of whining, crying and adults, that obviously are so dependent on their parents, that it can drive the viewer crazy.
All of this show is blown up by a vast amount of unnecessary scenes and dialogue, that do not contribute to the story's progress in the slightest, overall a 90 minute feature could have told everything in a better pace and might have kept the viewer on.
What I really liked were the beautiful views over the Marmara region, a big minus however were a lot of stereotypes in regards to the standing of females, as providers and recipients of commands.
