When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you'll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they're wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it's great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.


                
Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson (director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead the audience along Doss' journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey.Neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film, yet they also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller – the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror – these elements are all present, but they placed alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to draw in the audience for Doss' journey. The lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Doss' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans.The supporting roles add depth, with both script and performance making very few, if any, of the supporting characters two dimensional. Vince Vaughn's excellent turn as Doss' training sergeant provides both humour and pathos to bring laughs and pause- for-thought at well scripted points of the tale, allowing the audience to gather their breath.By the end of the film, audience members will leave the cinema feeling tired, worn out by having experienced Doss' journey of hope, innocence, love, confusion, anger, faith, and courage. Hacksaw Ridge is in no way a popcorn-lazy-Sunday-afternoon film; it is a journey.


                
War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson's latest war drama 'Hacksaw Ridge' it manages to be something more that we can grasp it.The true life story of Desmond Doss is finally brought to the big screen, Doss was a US Army medic who served during WWII, but coming from a family with a strong religious beliefs and a father that struggled with the aftermath of WWI (a veteran himself) it lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist, refusing to bare a firearm and the use of violence against another. His personal choice would affect his country's army and persuaded a court hearing to charge Doss for his personal beliefs and objection to bare arms but despite this, he is given the chance though to fight alongside his 'brothers' in the Battle of Okinawa, a battle which the American forces fought against the invading Japanese in an intense and brutal battle. It is here in this key battle that Doss was recognised as a true hero for his country, as he managed to rescue the lives of 75 soldiers wounded in battle.Gibson returns to the director's chair to helm this true story, giving his touch of humanistic quality, anti-war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail. The direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during the 2 ½ running time. The first half of the film is about character and what establishes Doss to become a legend that he is known for, while the 2nd half of the film focuses on his role during the Battle of Okinawa and the brutal battle itself. The violence here is given so much detail, not holding back on the horrors of war and the devastating effect it carried on both sides. The production design, sound mixing, editing and scale of the battle is as intense, horrifying and respectful to the details and real life experiences to what we've read in history books, but it is yet filmed with beautiful and yet brutal detailing that echoes much to Saving Private Ryan's D-Day battle sequence. The 2nd half of the film is much darker than the first half and people will need a strong stomach to handle the graphic depictions of violence and deaths we see throughout, but it does get emotional at times and in the last few minutes of the film, though overall the film is emotional with Doss's back-story, his personal lifestyle and the brotherhood that Doss and his army experience and share on the battlefield.In terms of acting, the cast as a whole is incredible with Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer giving the best key performances of the film. Garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor, breaking away from his well known role as Spider-Man prior to HR. To describe his role as Doss, he gives a quality that defines him as a simple man with values in his life while facing a few struggles that form his belief of not bearing violence or firearms. Garfield must have given much study and preparation for the role, as his character's journey from a wise simple man to a hero of his army is given so much heart, emotion and bravery to make the journey of Doss so believable.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is a film that will leave audiences in state of emotion that describes the horrors of war, the bravery of Doss and his army and a sense of thankfulness to our past ancestors who had lived in a time to fight for freedom and peace when the world was divided. An incredible film that will indeed earn its amount for Oscar nominations and wins in 2017 (possibly for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Production Design, Music Score, Sound Mixing & Editing and Script) alongside other film awards. A must see film if you have studied history at school, have an interest in history or if you love a solid war film that's true to its core. A masterpiece that will not be forgotten so quickly or never will, we both highly recommend it.5/5 Autistic Reviewers


                
This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. When I thought it'd be just another Hollywood war movie about a typical war hero, it definitely surprised me, especially when it's faithful to the True story.I was amazed God is everywhere in this movie... in a Hollywood war movie? Wow.Half way through the movie, I understand that without explaining this soldier's strong Christian faith, this real story cannot be told. Without God, it would not have happened.** Might have spoilers below **Without God, a young man named Doss would not stick to the "thou shall not kill" commandment even in the bloodiest war zone. He would not have promised God that he would not touch a firearm in the first place, and then volunteered to serve along other soldiers at the front line against the Jap troops. Yes, at the front line without anything protecting himself except his bible and faith in God (you really have to see the movie to see what the bloody war was like).Without God, Doss would not have persevered even when he joined, when no one else understands/agrees with what he was doing, physically abused him, and almost put him into the war prison for disobeying the order to use a firearm. Many told him to give up and go home. He did not, even though he didn't fully understand why God calls him there. He persevered with his faith in God.Without God, when his comrades retreated at the Hacksaw Ridge in Japan, Doss would not have stayed, and had faith to re-enter the war zone ALONE and without firearm one time after another to save the wounded, while the Jap troops were everywhere hunting for them. By a simple prayer: "Lord, please help me get one more." He saved 75 soldiers (his comrades said it was actually close to a 100 when Doss modestly said 50, so they took the average)At the saving scene, I was so touched that I told my husband perhaps precisely because God didn't want to leave the wounded soldiers behind to die or to be captured, Doss has been called to be there. And not only that, what he did gave hope to his comrades for a comeback.Praise the Lord, for He must be behind all this.Thank you Mel Gibson and the production team because they were very faithful to the truth of this real story.----------I went to check some of the facts and wow they were mostly true, e.g. at historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/hacksaw-ridge/The real Desmond Doss considers it a _miracle_ that he made it off the ridge on Okinawa. "His heroics didn't go unnoticed, as fellow soldiers were often amazed he was still alive." - The Conscientious Objector Documentary"Doss doesn't hesitate to heal a man in need. He doesn't see skin colour, he doesn't see uniform, he doesn't see an enemy. This is a transcendent act and a rare thing to witness in our culture."Final note: Let's not undermine the contribution of the other soldiers who fought and were injured/died at the battlefields, nor justify war itself, but this story of Doss opens up a whole new perspective that if you stick to what God really teaches, something incredible happens.
This was by far the best picture of the year and a great comeback for Mel Gibson. It didn't win best picture because of the politicization of the Oscars. No way that "Moonlight" even came close to this film. To win an Oscar now you have to be non-white and LGBT. It reminds me of how "Saving Private Ryan" lost to a ho-hum movie "Shakespeare in Love." People still watch SPR but who ever talks about the other movie. So I predict that Hacksaw Ridge will become a classic while the other movies is well forgotten. Hacksaw Ridge, on the other hand, is a story that is so unbelievable because it stretches all credibility but hits us in the face because it actually happened. One of those "no one would believe it if they made a movie" but it actually happened. The courage of that man going alone, unarmed, except for his faith in God, directly into the mouth of hell. I am not a Christian but the devotional aspect of this movie was very inspiring. I would recommend anyone to see this movie and forget the other movie.


                
I felt that this movie was a instant contender for best war movie when I watched it. Compared to Saving Private Ryan, it has definitely benefited from the technology of today's age. The story line itself was very inspirational and a heart warming experience that was moving from start to finish.


                
Mel Gibson proved again that he is a magnificiant director, 'Hacksaw Ridge' in my opinion one of the best War movies I ever seen. "To believe in God is to believe in humanity.To believe in humanity is to believe in God".Starting with this quote I'm focusing now on the story of Desmond Doss,who served as an army medic in Okinawa war, a greatest hero that saved a lot of lifes without firing a bullet. President of the US gives to Doss the Medal of Honor in October 12,1945. The story clearly illustrates that the only weapon can be faith and pure love for life,combining with a remarkable dose of courage.I have to mention about the injustice born of inability and deep understanding,when soldier Doss in the training camp was one step away to face the martial court because he didn't want to use a gun,a crucial moment which eventually solved well,I was glad and relieved when his father came with the 'saving' letter from the general. Great actors,wonderful effects and a very emotionant scenery that makes your heart trembling,from the beginning to the extraordinary end. This film is worthy of respect.
This was a wonderful depiction of immense courage in the face of adversity--one of the most intensely moving films we've ever seen. My father was a Marine veteran of Okinawa and I personally really appreciate the research that went into making this great movie. He never shared much of his story with me while he was alive, and though my father didn't see combat in the battle depicted, this movie gave me many insights into what he saw when he was only 20 years old.There were many times during the movie that i was moved to the point of tears, and overall this was an emotionally gripping but yet still entertaining depiction of the horrors of war and the reality faced at Okinawa. HIghly highly recommended. Do not skip seeing this in theaters!


                
It has been just a while since the movie released and I have already watched it three times. This movie is beautiful and emotional. Mel Gibson has made a perfect comeback and I do think, not appreciating his work and his film would be totally unfair. The score is the backbone to the film just like Braveheart. I really loved Rupert-Gregson Williams work and I would compare it to likes of Hans Zimmer and Late James Horner. The movie is more about a love story than War, instead this film actually condemns war. If the critics stop their hatred for Mel Gibson then this will certainly be Best Picture and will wind up the whole Academy Awards. Andrew Garfield's intense acting fuels the film and keeps you interested. The only problem that I found in the film was that a lot of actors had their accent, this I found quite minor and not notable. People complaining about the violence will be shocked to see how beautifully Mel has handled those scenes. I would compare it to Saving Private Ryan and I personally feel like I has an edge over Spielberg's Movie. I am myself a Jew and I don't like Mel Gibson for his Anti-Semitic attitude, but denying his art would be wrong. ****I LOVED IT****


                
An excellent piece of work by Mel Gibson. This film deserves highest rating cause there is no single boring moment from beginning to end. This film reminds me of Tom Hank's Forrest Gump. The Romance scenes are exceptional. This is a kind of film which reveals what a man can do in a battle without the use of any weapons. The transformation of Andrew Garfield from the Amazing Spiderman to a private soldier is truly mesmerizing. I bet you'd wet your eyes during the war scenes. And above all its a true story and what else worth more than watching this..


                
Plot Overview: <U+200B>An incredible true story about Desmond Doss(Andrew Garfield), a religious soldier who went into Hacksaw Ridge as a battle medic... while refusing to hold a gun.Directed by Mel GibsonStarring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn and Teresa Palmer# NO SPOILERS! Overall: This is one of the best war movies I've seen in a very, very long time. Say what you want about Gibson's personal life, but this movie proves he can direct.Would Recommend!# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Andrew Garfield was phenomenal as Desmond Doss and really made the character shine. Teresa Palmer was great of Dorothy Doss. Vince Vaughn was good as Sergeant Howell but his character didn't exist and it really takes away from his performance. Luke Bracey and Sam Worthington were pretty good as Smitty and Captain Glover respectively. Hugo Weaving was brilliant as the drunken dad, Tom Doss. The character development was admirable.It's a phenomenal, inspiring, emotional and beautifully written story that 100% needed to be made. I'm not a religious man but the way Gibson depicted it in the movie made me respect and truly admire his dedication to his faith. This was true until the end when I though the religious symbolism went too far and pushed too hard. I also feel the tribute at the end could have had more of an impact.The cinematography was excellent and it's grittiness really showed the atrocities of war.The effects were nigh flawless.This movie showed the incredible story of courage and belief that is Desmond Doss. It also shows the barbaric nature of war and shows the torment and abuse Doss faced along his way.The religious beliefs of Doss are definitely present but, not until the end, are not crammed down your throat. The attempts at humour succeeded. I admire how they didn't hold back on violence and the movie genuinely benefited from it. I think it could have had a better title because 'Hacksaw Ridge' makes you think more about the battle instead of Doss. The cleanup montage after Doss goes back into Hacksaw Ridge felt rushed and boring.Personally, I was enthralled in this movie from start to finish and I enjoyed immensely.10/10
"It was a scene straight out of hell. There is no other way to describe it." This quote from Higa Tomiko, a survivor of the Battle of Okinawa when she was seven years old, may be the best description one can take away from "Hacksaw Ridge", the most recent World War II film directed by Mel Gibson in a stunning return to prominence among his Hollywood peers. It tells the story of Private Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to handle a weapon, but felt it was his moral duty to serve his country in a time of war when many of his friends and neighbors opted to do the same. It's a story of perseverance, courage and sheer fortitude, and one bound to affect even the most hardened viewer.In terms of battle imagery, this is probably the most relentless, bloody and vicious film yet, even more so than "Saving Private Ryan" or "Band of Brothers". The absolute carnage on display is not for the faint of heart, and there are more than one scene that come out of nowhere to jar the viewer upright in your seat. Director Gibson even utilizes the technique in a civilian scene when Desmond Doss and his brother wind up fighting each other as kids, and Desmond uses a brick to lay out his sibling in a frightening scene, one that establishes Doss's very first insights about the morality of taking a person's life.I thought Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Desmond Doss was superb during the battle segment which dominated the latter part of the picture. Some of the boot camp scenes came across as somewhat unrealistic to me in as much as Doss seemed to defy his superiors with a smile on his face and sometimes without recrimination, although he did suffer the abuse of his fellow soldiers who thought he was a coward. Another element that seemed to defy logic was how the entire company of men from training wound up in Okinawa together, including the officers from boot camp. Not having been in the military, I don't know how that works, but it didn't seem that likely to me.Generally, I have a problem with war films that introduce a romantic element, however Desmond's relationship with future wife Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) is handled with careful restraint. The interruption of Desmond's father (Hugo Weaving) at the military court martial proceedings was another one of those elements that seemed to defy credibility, so that's one I'll have to research.Because of the film's central focus on Desmond Doss and his heroic actions at Hacksaw Ridge, one might be tempted to believe that this was the only battle he participated in. In fact, Doss also served in the Pacific Theater in the battle campaigns of Guam and Leyte Gulf, earning an entire host of citations for his bravery, including the Medal of Honor. Totally unexpected, but a very welcome conclusion to the picture had clips of the real life Desmond Doss speaking to his experience during the war prior to his death in 2006. Stills of the young Doss bear a remarkable likeness to the actor who portrayed him, thereby adding a further sense of realism to the story in retrospect. Over all, the movie is a remarkable tribute to a man who held a deep conviction and commitment to a higher power while stating "I figure I'll be savin' people, not killin'."
Hacksaw Ridge is a 2016 film directed by Mel Gibson which marches the viewer in the gory Battle of Okinawa from the perspective of Desmond Doss, a Courageous war medic. While I have watched countless war films from the grave black and white In Harm's Way, to comical war scenes of Forrest Gump, Hacksaw Ridge trumps them all because of Mel Gibson unification of war with personal story allowing the viewer to relate a gigantic, incomprehensible war on a personal level. Because Gibson synergizes macroscopic and microscopic events, the macroscopic being the historic battle of Okinawa and the microscopic being the life and war efforts of the courageous medic, Desmond Doss, the viewer can be impacted by the film in a way that could never be accomplished in a documentary.Gibson reveals details of Desmond Doss' adolescence at the start of the film to allow the viewer to connect emotionally to Doss, even though his adolescence does not directly pertain to the Okinawa War itself. The film begins with Desmond as a teenager fearlessly exploring the outdoors with his brother. As the two scale a bolder- covered mountain, Desmond's brother offers Desmond a hand up a large stone step up to reach the mountain's apex. Grinning, Desmond taps his brothers hand away, saying "I got it". In this first scene, Gibson builds enormous character into Desmond Doss. The viewer is not greeted by some generic, run of the mill, soldier on the battle field, he is greeted by a teenager, the age group of a heightened keenness towards uniqueness. The viewer is not presented with a Doss on the battle field, after he is forced by the army into a courageous mold, but is instead presented with a teenage Doss born to be born to be fearless, climbing to the highest ledge on the mountain peak, to dance along its crease, and born to be courageous, climbing to the top without a single helping hand from his older brother. Building details from Doss' youth in the first scenes allows Gibson to portray Doss as an easily relatable individual. Gibson also builds a sturdy foundation of Christianity into the Desmond Doss belief system. As a teenager, Desmond watches his drunk father beat his brother, while wheezing for another glass of whiskey. Desmond's brother collapses from physical and mental trauma. The camera pans from the front lawn where Desmond's older brother lay, to a tearing Desmond Doss in the kitchen, eyes affixed on brutal painting of Cain killing Able, with the bold red lettering underneath, "Thou Shal Not Kill", one of the Ten Commandments of the Lord. Doss prays to God. Later in the film, Desmond reveals that it was because of that painting, and watching his father nearly kill his brother, that he promised God to never touch a rifle, an incredible promise Desmond attempts to keep all through the war. The second object that Gibson reoccurring displays, to support Dosses appearance as a Christian, is a bible which Doss' Fiancé gifts to him through the window of his training camp bus, while saying good bye. "Keep it close to your heart", she reminds him. While the training camps other members read the Playboy Magazine other worldly material, Doss keeps his eyes on the bible, reading verses to himself every free moment. While ridiculed by his peers, Doss boldly continues reading and holding onto the bible until while fighting at Hacksaw ridge. The Hacksaw Ridge War Scene is brutally realistic, with blood, explosions, and death, each of which the average viewer cannot relate to. But when Gibson narrows the scope down to a war torn Doss, pleading too his carriers on a stretcher to find his bible where he had been wounded on the battle field, the scope of the battle is automatically put into perspective. The viewer, who is emotionally connected to Desmond Doss and understands his character, cannot reduce him to another soldier and must see him as the courageous, moral, and selfless individual, that Doss is. This perspective places invites the audience to ask, "What would I do in Doss' situation", a question that throws the viewer right beside Doss on his stretcher, begging with him for the bloodstained bible that he clung onto through his entire service in the cold bloody war. A war documentary's viewer-immersion-factor cannot compare to this Hacksaw Ridge's. Finally, what makes Hacksaw Ridge a classic is not only how Gibson portrays Doss, but also the choice in choosing Doss to be the star of the film. The story of Doss is remarkable. When called by his commander at the war-front to retreat in battle, Doss hears his true calling from God to save the remaining men that were injured and abandoned on the field, positioned to be tortured by ruthless Japanese. Doss remains on Japanese territory alone, healing each injured Soldier he finds, including some injured Japanese, dragging them across the line of combat, into American Territory. Doss selflessly prays with each soldier he saves, "Lord, help me find one more" before running back into the devastated enemy terrain, until finding one more soldier and dragging them into American Territory. Doss, alone, saves 75 men, and without Doss' courageous actions, a mere 35 men would have returned from the week's fight. Desmond Doss' faith in God and bravery in the face of the worst danger is the inspiring plot that allows Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge to impact the masses.Using details from Desmond Doss' adolescence, and displaying his character, Gibson connects the viewer emotionally to Doss, allowing the war which takes place around Doss to impact the viewer. Overall, Desmond Doss' actions leave the viewer with both a feeling of humility, longing to emulate the bravery of an American citizen nearly giving one's life to save many, and a feeling of courage, watching American demonstrate pure heroism. Hacksaw Ridge should remain an American classic forever.
This is a film I have been waiting to see for a while, so as you can imagine the hype was growing by the minute. And then i saw it. This film is absolutely mesmerizing, hats off to you Mr Gibson you made and extraordinary piece of film making. From the masterful camera-work and framing of the shots to the Oscar worthy performances he has managed to capture out of ever single cast member. Yep when you manage to get a good performance out of Luke Bracey (Utah- Point Break 2015) you know you are a legend. This film absolutely moved me, Desmond Doss is one of the most inspiring men of all time and his story is captured so well here, I won't spoil his story here but my god is it inspiring. This film absolutely positively deserves a 10/10 rating.This is the best movie of 2016 by far and everybody should experience it.


                
I was really surprised with this film. I didn't expect to like it so much. The story and characters are intriguing. The action is bloody and suspenseful. It's all based on a true story of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who was a devoted Christian and refused to carry a firearm during WWII. Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Doss, a young man who enlists in the army to help people. He wants to be a medic and save lives, but not kill. Everyone ridicules him for it to the point where he's beaten up, and almost arrested for insubordination. His father helps by sending a letter to the court from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. Soon enough, he's released and able to join his squad to the battle of Okinawa. During the bloody war, Desmond will do whatever it takes to save the wounded men, even without so much as picking up a gun. His faith and skills are put to the test. I don't usually go for war films, but this one is special. I highly recommend HACKSAW RIDGE!!!
I don't know what I can add to the other reviews on here. This story of Desmond Doss reminds of the books of David McCullough. He writes his books about people in American history that have too long not received their dues, and it's about time we gave credit where credit is due. That is how I feel about the main character in this movie. Why haven't I ever heard about him before now!? The gore in the battle scenes puts Walking Dead to shame, but it's about time we see what war is really like. It's not about parades and flags and fireworks; it's the hand to hand blood and fire, sweat, and unimaginable fear that these people endured. It is no wonder they are called the greatest generation. Desmond Doss is my new hero because of this movie, and it deserves every nomination it has received for every award. Bravo!
The movie is full of romance, patriotism, drama and emotion. I enjoyed the movie a lot. I am very glad to here that it won awards in several events and those were totally perfect for it. None will be unhappy watching the movie. It inspires us to love country and work for country. I'm fallen in love with this very movie. Thank you the movie producers, actors and others for presenting such an inspirational movie to us.


                
Impressively articulates the contours of war, valor, love, faith, honor and the sanctity of life. I laughed, pondered, cried, identified, curled up on my seat while deeply getting in touch with the realities of human conflict and war. Mel Gibson is absolutely uniquely talented. I felt immersed in two very different realities that shook me up and turn me upside down. He successfully touches the soul. Don't read about it, just watch it and let the experience be the envoy. Too bad he has some powerful enemies who cowardly and viciously discredit him and hinder his success. Hopefully, the honorable will step forward so that he won't be robbed of a well deserving award.


                
Just a couple of minor comments that I don't consider spoilers, but you know how it is.The comment made by my wife as we left the theater today - both of us with shed and unshed tears in our eyes - was simple. "What a story of commitment, and of faith." That's what's been missing in what's coming out of Hollywood for so long.That's what this boils down to. Desmond Doss made a commitment to God to not shed blood, to not kill, to never use a gun in anger. And when we see his childhood and the other events, you can understand it. But when the Japanese attacked the U.S., he felt the same surge of patriotism as everyone else. He could have taken a pass, but he didn't feel right in staying home. He says in the movie that two guys from his home were found to be 4F and killed themselves from shame. So he didn't feel right in not going.This is an extremely violent movie, extremely graphic. That's the reality of war. You get to know people during the basic training sequence, and then watch them die. Horrifically. Yet due to his actions, Desmond saved so many more that would have died otherwise. Anyone who complains that the Vince Vaughn drill sergeant is a ripoff of Full Metal Jacket has apparently never served in the military. That was also reality.This movie will stick with you. People say it's racist against Japanese. That's ALSO how it was then. People will say it's too violent. That's the reality of war. What they miss is that it's also the journey of a man who made his relationship with God, made a promise to God, and kept that promise. "One more, God, let me get one more." Hands destroyed from rope burns, exhausted, beaten and battered. "One more, God, let me get one more."
The best movie I have seen in years. I absolutely loved the emotion involved in the romance, the difficulty of war, the commitment to his faith is incredible and the strength he has to look to God when most cannot do what he did. This moved me to the core, and it was very inspirational to my faith. I love the characters in the film, and the casting was top notch.. I never expected to like this movie as much as I did.
ADVANCE SCREENING REVIEW: Not since Saving Private Ryan have we seen a movie with this much action and story line. The movie is a true depiction of WWII and leaves nothing to the blind eye. You will be on the edge of your seat 90% of the movie. (No bathroom or popcorn breaks) " SPOILER ALERT " A true story of a soldier that refuses to carry a gun but ends up saving 75 of his fellow soldiers in combat. The action is real to life and not for the weak at heart. Michael Shannon gives an outstanding performance under the excellent direction of Mel Gibson. This film will leave you crying but proud at the end. Don't wait until it hits red-box or cable. A must see at the theater.
Just when we thought all WWII stories have been told, this film offers an interesting story about a consciousness objector who chose to fight the system by serving in the military anyway as a medic. Mocked as a coward, he proves himself as one of the bravest in his unit. Critics here will state that it unrealistically depicted combat, but unfortunately this is Hollywood, which will use artistic licenses to promote a story.

The BEST WWII film I have seen. Better than Band of Brothers, Fury, and Saving Private Ryan. Mel Gibson is a master cinematographer of the gut- wrenching realism of war, as well as the sweetness of human frailty. I had no knowledge of Desmond Doss nor his bravery. His conviction to his beliefs, faith, and love of country was incredible. Andrew Garfield should have won the Oscar, he is amazing in this film. The depth of character, reading the fear in his eyes, and yet he goes back to save his comrades. Please see this film.

Ignore those that are giving this movie bad reviews because of the Christian themes in it (the lead actor is a Christian and there are allusions to the Bible and Prayer, etc.) That's to be expected these days. It doesn't matter how good a movie is, they'll chew it up because they are angry about anything in it that makes it references Christ in any shape, size form or fashion. How dare a movie try to cram Jesus down the throat of the viewer!...puuuulease! Gees, grow up and quit whining.So, ignore all of that non-sense and see this movie for what it really is; a great movie, with great acting, wonderful special effects (although very violent, so keep young kids away from it), the language isn't all that bad for a war movie and you even have a bit of a love story mixed in for the 'mush-movie' lovers (lol). You'll be glad you watched this movie, trust me.
