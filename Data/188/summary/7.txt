 Stunning, but overlong

 Lovely String of Soliloques in Which the Film's Subject is Actually Irrelevant

 Don't try seeing this on video

 (the story is) very good and original

 Without a Clue, An Intriguing and Metaphoric Movie Very Difficult To Be Understood

 Its Cinematography Is Astounding, The Narrative Is Scare

 Film vs book

 STALKER - entering the Zone

 Cerebral Adventure

 A Slow but Intriguing Film

 Impossible to rate
