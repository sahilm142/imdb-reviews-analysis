 Moments of menace..

 German Expressionism at its cinematic best

 A hidden message warning against Nazi Germany, Lorre's performance, and Lang's direction all make this a very good film

 Peter Lorre's star-making film

 Worth at least 1 watch

 A very good film, but perhaps not a masterpiece.

 as if i couldn't tell..

 Some have said that there's honor among thieves . . .

 Lang's Rich Mystery Contains a Fair Share of Flaws

 A Very Good Movie

 German vs English versions

 Kangaroo Court Drama-Thriller

 M for "modern"

 Magnificent Murder Mystery

 A great procedural--cum--thriller

 Peter Lorre saves this movie.

 Pleasantly surprised here -- more than I expected

 Is vigilante justice ever acceptable?

 An Engaging Milestone of Film

 Times and regimes may change, but the nature of humans does not

 A Delirious Dance

 Without Lorre, M would not have been half as memorable.

 Damn those Germans are rough with their Expressionism

 A child murderer is top priority.

 Lang's twisting, turning, thrilling tale of a killer on the run and danger around most corners holds up.
