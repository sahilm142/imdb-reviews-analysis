 Abject failure of a remake of Infernal Affairs (SPOILERS)

 Confusing and Adsurd

 The most over rated movie of 2006

 A chore to watch

 Mediocre, the original is FAR superior

 What a wretched pile of f**k.

 This movie is the NY Yankees of 2006

 Not an Oscar worthy film!

 Lean Streets

 A Farce at Best

 Sad, sad, sad

 So much potential...

 Deliriously loopy, hysterically bad

 Very weak effort. **SPOILERS**

 Scorsese never fails .... to disappoint.

 Totally weak

 Poor Script, Confusing Directing and Gratuitous Violence

 senility contest between Nicholson and Scorcese

 Another disappointment from a past master.

 No plot

 Generally an okay watch but knowing that Scorsese was behind it makes it a disappointment for me

 Don't Waste Your Money

 An utterly depraved production.

 who else was fooled?

 Very poor quality
