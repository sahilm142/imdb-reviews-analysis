 Neither tedious nor a masterpiece

 over-rated but interesting

 Cinematography ahead of its time. Interesting recovered film.

 Standing for Something

 Every Bit Worthy Of Its Legendary Status

 Going to the Extreme Close-Up

 compelling closeup acting

 Cinema is the art of movement, theatre the art of words

 A fantastic film.
