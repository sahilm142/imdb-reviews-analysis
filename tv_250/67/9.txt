Now in its 20th season, South Park still dissects the most ridiculous behaviour in our society with merciless precision, and nobody comes away clean. And it's funny how people still react the same way to the show as they did 20 years ago:The self-proclaimed flag bearers for our nation's moral standards still can't see anything in the show beyond its naughty language and (perceived) vulgarity (and while half of them are genuinely offended by the show for those reasons, the other half secretly loves the show precisely for its naughty language and overall vulgarity and toilet humor).The ones who make fun of the self-proclaimed flag bearers still believe only they are smart enough to see anything beyond the obvious naughty language and overall vulgarity in it (and while most of them pretend to only love the show for its satirical elements, the majority of them actually love it because of its naughty language and overall vulgarity and toilet humor).And then there's the third group of people who get the satire but just flat out admit that it's effing hilarious seeing Gerald getting peed in the face by his loving wife Sheila or when the boys protest the girls' protest by proudly taking their tiny wieners out while raising a fist.If anything comes close to good satire and ruthless comedy in the vein of Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' today, it's South Park. Blind followers of any movement beware: Matt and Trey have it in for all of us, nobody is safe. God help us all if they ever decide to retire, society would be all the worse for it. Come to think of it: Let's start a petition for a co-presidency in the U.S. so they both can run for president and save the country (and the world!) from either the giant douche or the turd sandwich. Damn, that last comment makes me a follower too.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/


                
How creative are the makers of this show,making over 200 episodes, with each one (except the famous episode-Scott Tenorman must die) featuring at least two plots, each plot being somehow inexplicably and bizarrely linked to the other? Whether it was More Crap (the episode in which Bono got ripped) or Insheeption (the parody on Inception), the makers have an amazing talent of starting a story in one direction, completely veering it on its head and then proceeding, while adding further, random elements to it, all adding to the chaotic but somehow congruous final product. Southpark isn't about the witty one-liners or sarcasm that Friends was built on. It's a delightful mix of completely unsubtle and in-your-face profanity and vulgarity with satirical humor dispensed both openly and cryptically. It's bottom line is to rip on everything and everyone,from businessmen to environmentalists,from politicians to activists, no one is spared. It routinely blows normal situations to ridiculous and comical proportions and the makers set no boundaries for in this show, absolutely anything can happen. And its funny. It brings up normal everyday things, and shows us the funny side. It hardly ever takes one side, but rips on both of them. This is one of the most intelligent shows out there. It's a slap in the face of the overtly-sensitive, the conservative and the insensitive and the liberal at the same time. It's a satire. It's gross and graphic. It has no boundaries. It's racist and insensitive, but in a light manner. It's controversial and contemporary. Bottom line-It's one of the best TV shows of all time.


                
Without fail South Park continues to provide an intellectually insightful view into modern society. There may be many moments of disgust mixed in with humour but every episode I find myself learning something. How odd is it that you can say you learn't something from South Park. Some people may find what they portray offensive but it is all relatively truthful and soundly researched. I find myself thinking that everything they do is based on common sense and I appreciate that they believe in equality when it comes to calling out idiotic behaviour.If you don't give South Park a proper chance you will never understand the genius behind it or if you cannot get over your righteous beliefs to look at the world objectively then you will remain disgusted with the so-called decline in popular culture. Stop judging and allow it to be what it is...A show that calls it as it is.


                
Now listen, i'm giving this show a 9 because the previous seasons before season 19 were excellent. They really influenced many other hilarious shows, and part of the fun of my childhood was tuning in to South Park when my parents were gone, only to be caught watching it. But the thing that keeps me from giving this show a perfect 10 is because i think the show has changed for the worst.So like i said first 18 seasons of South Park we're excellent, even the bad episodes in there still had great memorable moments. I tuned in to Season 19 and i noticed they wanted to do a story season were everything is connected. But that season provided little laughs and the finale was disappointing. I had high hopes for Season 20 because i thought Trey and Matt (the show's creators) had listened to the feedback on Season 19, but Season 20 was even worse then the last one. Many characters went through unnecessary changes, they put so much political topics into the show to the point where it felt like overkill, they managed to make Gerald (Kyle's dad) the most unlikable character in the show, many things that the show sets up are quickly forgotten, and the ending was bad (not disappointing like season 19, but just bad). Season 21 was an improvement from Season 20 but the show was still missing something. And i think i know what killed South Park.It's no secret that South Park has many political and social commentary tones, but that was never the main point of the show, that was just a good addition to it. But it's like Matt and Trey forgot that, and they made the social commentary the MAIN point of the show.The sad thing about it is Trey and Matt really want to go back to the roots of South Park, but they forgot how to. They got so carried away with Politics that they forgot that the heart of the show was 4 foul mouthed kids in a small mountain town that find themselves in the dumbest of situations. They completely ditched that part of the show and i eagerly want it back.


                
i am not shameful to say that i have watched all the episodes of the 16 seasons, understanding some while confused by some others, due to the culture gap.i like the show itself because of the reasons already mentioned by the others and many more.US TV shows are very popular in mainland china. here what shows you are watching is often a register to demonstrate your social status in your taste and whether you are up to date in following the fads. the sequence in watching TV shows from high to low is British show viewer-US-Japanese Korean-HK/Taiwan/Singapore-mainland Chinese-Thailand. viewers are just crazy. they waited online the whole night for a new episode to be posted, watched it without any Chinese sub-tiles, watched it again when the version with Chinese translation sub-tiles is released.the hits include Prison Break, Lost, Friends, Homeland and many others. SP and another one Mad Men are not so popular, since they might be too culturally loaded that they are rather hard to understand.apart from all the praise the former reviews heaping on the show i can still add quite a few.no one mentions the opening disclaimer of the show. have you ever seen that before? it gives you a hint in what style the show is going to be.besides its staggering AC Nelson Ratings (more than 13 with the episode who is Cartmen's Father), the show gets responds from the academics, with books analyzing and discussing it, like Pychology in SP.what is amusing is when i happened to come across a short clip of porn, the 18 year old heroine tells the camera she likes SP most when interviewed.just like the characters in Friends, here in SP, the smart one might do something stupid, while the mean might offer a hand to the needy. no one is perfect and even the most hated might do something good. they are surreal most of the time and at one point they are just the guys cross the road. to sum up, whether you love or hate the show, you have to admit it that in one way or another, you are the very person depicted in the show,be it mean, ignorant, stupid, racist or anything.


                
The show has programed 169 episodes and has signed on to at least do another 54. Unlike some other shows, this has remained fresh and exiting and like previous shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy I will do a count on all the seasons separately and you will see what I have thought of the show as it has progressed.Season 1: The show came out being advertised as the new show that kids cannot watch and it started out great, it may not have had great computer animation for the time (The first episode being cut paper strips) but the writers thought of a new idea, "Lets be offensive and funny" well they did it brilliantly and early on was showing signs of an extremely long run. I rate this season 78%.Season 2: Great season, one of the best the season messed with and crossed the boundary's in the wacky way it does and showcased some other talents such as its ability to make fun of any celebrity they feel like. This season has made me laugh numerous times and watching them again still brings a smile to my face. I rate this season 83%.Season 3: The best season of them all, the show crossed the boundary many times and you just felt that the show had reached the tip of its iceberg and that the show could go on for another 10 years and still remain funny. I rate this season 92%.Season 4: This season was crossing the border, the show was not as wacky and its humour focused on celebrity's being parodied, however the season was funny and really enjoyable and maybe I only compare this to season 3 making it seem less funny but there was something here that seemed less funny. I rate this season 77%.Season 5: I have not seen all of this series but the half I have seen was extremely funny and with the times. The show was offensive but in the good way and South Park's wacky ness combining the offensive ness made something special again and showcased what season 4 did not. I rate this season 89%.Season 6: This season was so damn OFFENSIVE!. The show was offensive the whole time and they never let down. The humour was funny though and the episodes wholly enjoyable and in fact introduced 3 of the best episodes(The Proffesor Chaos episodes) of the whole series. I rate this season 85%.Season 7: This season was very funny and the episodes played out better then any other season, the show had its mediocrity's but the show was still enjoyable and worth while to sit down and enjoy on a nice night. I rate this season 81%.Season 8: Now this season was funny, showcasing hilarious episodes and some just funny ones the show was creative and witty and this season kept me wanting to come back for more. I rate this season 83%.Season 9: This season was good, very offensive and very weird (Episodes like Die Hippy die and Best Friends Ever) but the show was still good and I liked it and no episodes were unbearable. I rate it 78%.Season 10: Not great, just there to offend and not much else and I was not impressed, episodes dragged on and the episodes did not have enough humour to get them over the line. Some episodes were funny though like Cartoon wars, ManBearPig and Stanleys cup but apart from that I was not pleased. I rate this season 63% purely for the three previously mentioned episodes.Season 11: Great, Great, Great and word cannot express the joy I am feeling that South Park had returned to its hilarious ways. Imationland trilogy is the best thing I have ever seen and overall the season kicked arse. I rate this season 91%.Season 12: This is an edit since Season 12 just finished. Anyway this season was not as good as the other seasons. Some episodes just failed and this season had the first episode in the history of the show I have really not liked. Of course it did have some great oness though like. Over Logging, the two part Pandemic episode and the Elementary School Musical episodes being hilarious. I rate this 70%Season 13: Well, we'll just have to wait and see now wont we.Overall the show is clever and deserves recognition and apart from season 10 every season has been some clever s!it.I overall (Using a calculator to count up my average of course) rate this series a fair 82.5%.Seasons over Average: Season 2, Season 3. Season 5, Season 6, Season 8, Season 11 Seasons On Average: N.A.DSeasons under Average: Season 1, Season 4, Season 7, Season 9, Season 10, Season 12Seasons O.A: 7 Seasons IMOA: 0 Seasons UNDERA: 5


                
Four young boys - Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny - live in the Colorado town of South Park. Their adventures are varied, numerous and often bizarre. Moreover, South Park is a microcosm of the world.Wonderfully funny, satirical, irreverent and subversive. Screamingly funny at times. No subject is too taboo or sacred (well, almost no subject...) for the searing wit of creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Covers many topical, and often controversial, subjects with no holds barred.Only problem is that, in taking aim at everything, Parker and Stone sometimes leave mixed messages. Hard to figure where they stand on something, sometimes. This issue is more prevalent in the later seasons.


                
Is it misunderstood? To me it's like they want to limit their audience? They create a hilarious concept such as when you get older every new song on the radio sounds like crap. So they actually play flatulence with this crazy drumbeat and it makes ten year olds to sixty year olds laugh their butts off. But then what? Instead of filling out that episode with some other ideas, they put in more gross-out comedy with feces coming out of people's mouths. I love the show despite the toilet humour not because of it. But a little less would have won more fans for the show, methinks.
South Park is one of my favorite shows to watch, it makes me laugh and it makes me happy. I'll be honest there's plenty of episodes that I do not like but there's more of them I do. The newest season is really good and keeps a storyline which is different from the others. If you haven't seen South Park before I would definitely do so if you aren't offended easily. It's great at showing plenty of emotions like in the Episode 'Chef goes Nanners' Wendy and Cartman show to have feelings for each other. But in the next episode Cartman hates Wendy and doesn't want her to be in their band. I could use more examples but I don't want to write too much. Please check out the show as I think you'll enjoy it!


                
I started watching the show when I was 14, and I found it very interesting. The show was released in 1997, and will be over in 2019. Now, the parents guide<U+0085>WARNING! Contains spoilers. Sex/Nudity: 8/10: There is often rape in episodes. Also an episode is mainly about queefs, and another episode is about erections. Also, bare asses and penises are seen rarely. And in one episode, a character gets over-sized balls. Violence: 9/10: Blood has often been seen since season 8. Language: 10/10: F**k, S**t, W***e, and Ass are said in almost every episode. C**t and C**k are said rarely, and a few uses of N****r in Krazy Kripples. In one episode, S**t is said about 152 times. Also, Jimmy tries to say continuing, but stutters and says C**t. This is uncensored and very controversial. Drugs/Smoking: 6/10: Drugs are used, but not very often. Frightening/Intense Scenes: 8/10: The show is usually humorous, but can be quite intense at times. Characters are sometimes suicidal. Overall: 41/50. Suggested Age Rating: 16+.
In '97, Matt Stone and Trey Parker set out to make an animated series that would rival THE SIMPSONS. And to date, they're still chugging along. During the early years, their team used the most basic of animation techniques (everything looks like construction paper cut-outs) to create a world of demented, quirky citizens all living in the fictional Colorado town of South Park. More recently, the team has discovered CGI. Which has further helped them envision the town and characters more thoroughly. Typically, here's how an episode goes: The four main characters: boys Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, get mixed up in some sort of shenanigans; the town gets threatened by some kind of disaster; and usually, Kenny dies in some inventive way. Almost all the jokes are adult-themed, clearly not for children. Usually, there's a smattering of socially-relevant current topics that crop up in the show. Most of the time, there's no plot to speak of. There's also a healthy dose of profanity and scatological humor (fart and poop jokes are their favorite). Like with any TV series, some episodes are hits while others are misses. However, there is one episode that stands as their finest work: "MAKE LOVE, NOT WARCRAFT" that parodies on-line gaming. It was so well-received that it even won an Emmy or two!
This show has influenced my life! First, the creators have no limits... You will see horrible acts of violence and grotesque behaviour, shown in a funny way, as a joke... As I'm writing this review, Season 6 has been aired, and this means the show has been going thru a long way. Many people love this show, same as the people who really hate the show.South Park will open your horizons, and give you a new prespective of our cruel ugly world!


                
Well, I agree with many of the reviewers I've seen. This show is, on the surface, incredibly stupid and full of dumb fart and sex jokes. But if you look a little bit closer, you can see strangely intelligent, and extremely humorous, ties to our own society. For example, there is one where people from the future come to South Park for work. Because they work at jobs that none of the South Park residents want to, and because they do it cheaply... well, you can probably guess what ends up happening, something that makes the residents furious. Can you spot the ties to current US issues? If not then you probably won't get it; but if you do you'll see and understand more than just the sex jokes.I originally watched only a little bit of South Park, and went, "What a piece of garbage!" and turned it off. I voiced my disgust to a friend of mine who is apparently a loyal South Park watcher, and they insisted that I see it through. And I did. And now I watch it all the time. It's really the sort of show that grows on you, and once you start watching you realize that the way they use the farting and sex jokes is really quite funny. But you do understand more than that. So don't just pass it off as a dumb show, watch it a couple times and see what you think.


                
Initially was not sure as to whether 'South Park' would be my cup of tea at all, despite being a huge fan of animation for all my life (and still very much am). But there have been many instances of films and shows that gave me conflicted feelings before watching, but turned out far better than expected and actually being very good or more.Such is the case with 'South Park'. As of now, it is one of the highest rated shows on IMDb and was a huge ratings success when first aired, and no wonder. At its best, it's absolutely brilliant and one of the best and funniest shows there is to me. Thought that would never be said about a show known for dividing people with its controversial and "offensive" content, was not sure whether I would like it let alone love it and it ended up a favourite. Is it as good as it was? No, it's not as witty, daring or inventive now, but is still very funny and intelligent. That is only being said though because the earlier seasons are so good.To me, 'South Park' is much better than other popular shows like 'The Simpsons' (originally fantastic, now has declined rapidly) and 'Family Guy' and Seth Macfarlane's other shows, which never did anything for me.Can actually see though why some dislike it. A lot of the content is very controversial and not for the easily offended. The show is crude, extremely rude (possibly the rudest animated show ever), naughty, at times juvenile and less than subtle in its treatment of taboo subjects. At the same time, 'South Park' is hilarious, smart, witty and daring but also clever, sharp, irreverent and intelligent. The satirical humour is subversive and there are not many animated shows this daring, completely contradicting the tired and incredibly annoying cliché spouted constantly that animation is only for children (often by parents defending a panned family film).Often one is shocked at how much 'South Park' gets away with, everything. Every subject and every everyday issues is covered and satirised it seems, nothing escapes the writers. While subtlety completely goes out the window, so much of what 'South Park' says has a huge amount of truth and relevance (both when it first aired and still very much so now). Like good satire should it does it in a daring and perhaps divisive fashion, not holding back and taking no prisoners. This should sound like a recipe for disaster, but actually to me it was why the show is so loved and admired.There's more to 'South Park' than just the humour. The stories are very inventive, smartly constructed, cohesive, honest and relevant. The characters are some of the most memorable and iconic in recent animation, especially Cartman. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's voice work is a practical tour-De-force for both, both bringing so much individuality and personality to these characters and their writing.Not everybody seems to like the animation, personally liked the quirkiness of it myself and there are not many shows with visuals like 'South Park's'. The music is energetic and catchy.Overall, brilliant show that surprisingly became right up my street, even with the controversial content. 9/10 Bethany Cox


                
Suggested MPAA Rating: TV-14-DLSV, TV-MA(varies on episode and season) My Age Rating: 15+This is a great show. No doubt. It's not as risqué as some people think it is, it has plots, and is actually a show, not a p--n and s-x and dr-g show off.Four kids, Eric Cartman, the fatass Hitler, Kyle Broflovski,the jew, Stan Marsh, the normal guy, and Kenny, the poor guy. Follow them on their adventures in their little town!If you are easily offended, don't watch, if you are not mature, don't watch either.
South Park usually tries to push the limits on animation and always succeeds with its charming paper cut style, gross-out moments and gore and always keeps fans coming back for more. South Park was considered a fad in 1997 when it started with the episode "Cartman Gets A Anal Probe" where cartman is convinced the has been abductted by aliens and tries to prove it, and was called crude by many people and critcs alike however it was the highest rated program on comedy central. With many people requesting comedy central to watch South Park on their TVs the ratings increased and kids were even banned from having South Park T-Shirts in schools. i prefer having this shock humor burned in my mind rather than hearing practiclally farts for 30 minutes, because it actually tells you how much society messes up, like the over censorship of TV or how many stupid internet memes so all in all this show is practically the news only funnier and more entertaining.
When I saw people talking about South Park I always hear them talking about the same thing '' South Park is much cool is both dirty word''Because I am a person who likes series with intellect, I tried to stay away from South Park, until when I saw South Park, for seasons 7-8 I realized how wrong those people wereSouth Park is not just an offensive humor and meaningless, is a critical of acidic society and the world, is an intelligent humor, and offensive, that you do not see the South Park is cool simply because of their language real, like people really think and talk on the day-to-day, think about South Park as one of the greatest inventions of mankind, where the target of the criticism is simply the worldIf you do not like to see South Park because you feel ''offended'' I'm really sorry for you


                
... it improves with age. South Park has been one of the dominate adult cartoons to hit the world, along with the Simpsons and Family Guy; but somehow the quality of South Park improved, not decreased. The Simpsons and Family Guy are in the shadow of their former glories.South Park came to our screen in 1997 as a very rude, crude and funny show. The show focus on four friends, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny, all growing up in a mountain town in Colorado. They are very fouled mouthed, who end up getting into a lot of adventures, ranging from fighting battles between heaven and hell, stopping alien abductions, to fighting monsters. There is nothing the show will not do. South Park does use crude humour, from swearing to toilet humour, which can appeal to the child within all of us. But South Park has very clever writers, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. They add many social, political and cultural gags and satire, making the show both more intelligence, and one of it's great strengths is South Park's ability to keep the show contemporary. One on my favourite episodes is The Passion of the Jew where they rip a hole in the fans of the Passion of the Christ, and Mel Gibson. When the show started to age the writers had to mature the show's approach, and not use cheap laughs like killing Kenny every time. They had to be a social commentary, but that ended up increasing the humour to a more intelligence audience. South Park's philosophy has been called South Park Republicanism, where they are socially liberal and fiscally conservative. If the Republican party was really like that I would support then being an complete Democracy (despite the fact I'm not American).As well as great humour based on grand themes, one of the other key elements is the characters, Stan and Kyle both fairly normal and sympathetic characters, Cartman, an obese, anti-Semistic, racist (and the best character in the show), and Kenny who is a cannon fodder in the early seasons. There are also good supporting characters like Butters who is delightfully naive, Chef, the sex obsessed school chef and talented singer (he was voiced by Issac Haynes), to characters like Mr/Mrs Grayson. There is a great relationship between Cartman and Kyle, with Cartman ripping on Kyle for being Jewish, whilst Kyle fights back by reminding Cartman is a fat idiot. Cartman is evil and would be a really dislikable character in real live, but is so appealing to watch in the context of the show because he shows the worst parts of humanity.Essential viewing.


                
I must say that even just a year ago I couldn't stand watching South Park. I had never taken the time to really sit down and watch it once I was old enough to understand. I saw pieces when with my uncles on holidays and never understood the "funny" element of the show. This year however I started being friends with a different group of people. My new friends aren't as stuck up and they watched the show all the time. They all found the show very funny, which I thought was odd since we liked the same sort of shows and movies. So I sat down one night and watched the first episode, and by the end of the night I had watched the whole first season. South Park was better than I ever could have dreamed. I loved watching Kenny die over and over again. Seeing Stan puke on Wendy even when they were dating. Watching as Kyle went against his mother. Seeing Kyle and Stan the "super best friends" and wondering if there's more to that than there seems to be. Having Cartman follow Kyle around the US, all so Kyle will suck his balls. So much has happened and it leaves me wanting more. I can never seem to wait for the next episode wondering if anything new will happen between the boys. No matter if it's just another crazy adventure or some relationship (my favorite ship at the moment is Kyle/Cartman; I just watched imagination land.) Maybe there is a lot going on in the show but you have to love it. Yes there is language. Yes there is violence. Yes they make fun of religion. Yes they make fun of race. South Park makes fun of just about everything you can think of. The point is they make fun of it ALL. They don't just make fun of one race or religion. The show is funny and everything that could be viewed as bad just adds a little bit more to it. South Park is what it is. It's just plain funny, no matter what anyone says... it's amazing!
South Park is an American animated television comedy series about four third/fourth-grade school boys who live in the small, backward mountain town of South Park, Colorado. The series was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and has been distributed and aired by Comedy Central since 1997. The show is well-known for its pop-culture parody, scatological humor, and satirical handling of current events.Irrespective of whether , its the over rated campaigning for votes or its the intolerance of some rednecks for other communities, South Park has targeted them all. The makers have made the best use of their freedom of expression and have brought all kinds of prejudices to their knees by making an episode about each topic absolutely hilarious nailing the prejudice on the head.Many communities did not welcome it as it just brought forward their prejudices and pointed it right on its face.On August 26, 2007, it was revealed that Parker and Stone, South Park's creators, had renewed their contracts for a 15th season, running through 2011. In recent years, each season has been aired in two halves, in spring and in autumn, with a summer hiatus. The eleventh season began airing on March 7, 2007, and is set to follow this system. The first half of the eleventh season ended on April 18, 2007, and is scheduled to begin again on October 3, 2007.South Park's early episodes tended to be shock value-oriented and featured more Pythonesque humor than later episodes. Although satire had been used on the show occasionally in its early and middle years, it became more evident around the seventh season. Episodes have parodied Michael Jackson (in "The Jeffersons"), Paris Hilton ("Stupid Spoiled W*ore Video Playset"), The Passion of the Christ (in "The Passion of the Jew"), and American immigration policy ("Goobacks").Prior to season four, the main characters of the show were four third grade students (often called "the boys" when as a group for easier reference): Stanley "Stan" Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Theodore Cartman and Kenneth "Kenny" McCormick. There are many recurring characters on the show, including the boys' families, school staff and other students. These include Leopold "Butters" Stotch, Chef, Mr. Hankey, Towelie, Jesus, and Satan. There are also many other minor characters.South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is an Academy Award-nominated animated satirical comedy/musical film released in 1999 and based on the animated television series South Park. The film parodies animated Disney films such as Beauty and the Beast as well the Broadway musical Les Misérables. It features 12 songs by Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman. The song "Blame Canada" was nominated for an Academy Award. The film was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for frequent coarse language, crude sexual humor and violence.It was nominated for Best Song, Blame Canada was performed by Robin Williams at the Academy Awards.The film caused little controversy in Canada even though it poked fun at the country. Canadian Consul General (and former Prime Minister) Kim Campbell noted that the song "Blame Canada" did not offend her since it was clearly a silly satirical song not intended to insult her country. Well-known Canadian singer Anne Murray allayed concern about the fact that the song referred to her as a "bitch" by indicating that she wasn't offended by the tongue-in-cheek lyric. Murray was invited to sing the song on the Oscar telecast but declined due to a prior commitment. Robin Williams ended up singing it.I would suggest South Park to all Mature Audience who are willing to go beyond their everyday TV and movies to try this classic (series or the movie). I know I loved it.


                
South Park is the best thing ever to happen to animation! Really, I'm not lying. It is far superior to the Simpson's or the Family Guy. The Simpson's is funny yes, but in my experience the plots are tame. Yes, the Family Guy is funny also. The humor is very often insensible and pointless. If you want comedy from the big boys, then there is South Park.I will not even try to generalize the plot of South Park; it has been in play for far to long. Each episode is nearly always a story over itself per episode anyway. It is a story/comedy/commentary about current events in the United States of America. The twist being that it is saturated with liberal type philosophy. Any foreigners reading this? Psss, this show is an excellent portal into my great superpower dysfunctional hellfire nation. It is also very adult humor; the profanity in the show would fill volumes. But who cares about that? It is generally quite funny and nearly every episode comes with a moral lesson attached to it. If you are cool, you are already watching it. 10/10


                
Yes, "South Park" has survived all those negative reviews and comments from many people, including myself, but other than all that foul language and mature content (some people might not handle such content until they are old enough to live in a retirement home), there is the theme song. If I was to watch at least one part of it, it would be the opening sequence,because I like the theme song; it, like, spoofs the themes from "The Beverly Hillbillies", "Petticoat Junction", and "Green Acres"! Currently, the theme sounds more like those themes than ever before, especially the "Petticoat Junction" theme. BTW, the first season recording sounds a little like it has a carillon in the background, a la "Always Something There to Remind Me". So, if you want to watch "South Park", unless you can tolerate mature content, don't watch the actual show itself, just the opening sequence.BTW, I personally didn't like the show at first, but after about a decade, it has grown on me. People my age come to appreciate the rude and crude adult humor that the team of Parker and Stone have come out with, and I've taken a good laugh from them. Older people (like my older relatives) wouldn't appreciate the stuff that "South Park" has to offer, and they make a good point. It's just that what is right for some people isn't right for others. But no matter what I thought of the show itself, before or after, disdain or just-for-laughs, this is one of the shows that always gives me something to laugh at when I feel like it."Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"


                
Yes, South Park is very crude. The voices of impersonated celebrities are poor(as they admit!), and they occasionally may seem to pander to one political viewpoint or another. However, compared to most of the other biased crap on TV(on both sides), SP just doesn't give a rip. They put their own outrageous spin on everything going on in American society, and instead of really forcing a view of what to do about it down your throat, they poke fun and holes in the absurdity of the whole situation--perhaps of life itself. It is meant to be ridiculous commentary and cynical sarcasm about life in the USA and pop culture crap in general. People that don't get this show, or think it should be more preachy, or be sanitized from potty humor, don't get it at all. Sometimes, the show gets a bit tired(like any show, especially one this old!), but in using current events, it is really able to continue the laughs and the hilarity. SP is not perfect, but it makes you think in a way that also makes you laugh. Reveling in its own childish stupidity, it uses this to portray a country lost in its own stupid reality-- of celebrity "news", lame fads, PC absurdity, impractical ideologies, political opportunists, hypocrisy on every level, and a whole lot more.
For many reasons, this show will always hold fond memories for me. I was in junior high school when it premiered, and it didn't take long for the phenomenon to take over. The show's inspired humor and content certainly appealed to our age group. Within weeks, Kenny T-shirts and bad Cartman impressions had become commonplace. I wholeheartedly plunged feet first into the phenomenon and for awhile I was a borderline addict. Of course, the hype eventually died down and by the time I was in high school the likes of Jackass and Family Guy had emerged as the new shows of choice. Somewhere along the way, I lost interest and stopped watching South Park regularly after the fourth season. Earlier this year I caught some newer episodes, and suddenly the warm memories of my early teenage years came flooding back. The show has remained consistently hilarious throughout its impressive run and continues to defy the realms of good taste. No social hot topic or traditional value has escaped the show's demented satiric grasp. Therein lies part of South Park's genius: its uncanny ability to put a humorous spin on anything and anyone without a hint of guilt. I've recently caught up on most of the recent episodes through season 8. Although I'm not too fond of some of the show's newer changes (namely Cartman's new voice and the emergence of Butters as a main character) the crude and irreverent spirit that first got me hooked has remained intact. Plus the animation has improved dramatically, although in some aspects that's not saying much. It was one of the first shows that got me hooked as a rabid fan, and very few have given me as many laughs. For that, South Park will always be remembered as a huge source of entertainment during an important time of my life.


                
South Park returns to cap off a second decade of comedy.The twentieth season continued to use the reason trend of serializing the episodes so that the season exists as a whole building towards a silly climax. This season tackled the onslaught of trolls across the internet especially on social media websites with Gerald Broflovski being a secret troll SkankHunt. The season tried to capture the election but as they were stunned by the Trump win as most of the media were, they whiffed on the day after episode and had to catch up in the next few with Mr. Garrison standing in for the president. They did have the coiffed hair of our current President-elect and showed how the troll army worked in his favor.They had turned away from their attack of PC culture in the previous season but still registered some of the cultural shifts like white men believing they have a reason to be upset at women and bashing them for their lack of opportunity in comedy. All of this didn't amount to much as this felt like a weaker season of South Park, not sure of what they wanted to say and balancing several complicated issues.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
