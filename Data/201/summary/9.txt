 A Punch In The Stomach

 A Lot to Think About

 Genuine emotions!

 An underdog movie with a surprising twist

 A film with an emotional punch

 simply terrific

 Another fine hour for Eastwood

 Unforgettable

 If it's a "love or hate" movie, I loved it. Maybe Eastwood's best?

 a girl's fight against the life

 Well deserving of its Oscars

 Great Drama!

 Fighting in and out of the ring

 Clint Eastwood Displays His Talent Again

 A film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead

 What may have been in Clint Eastwood's character's past...

 Against All Odds...

 Better than a million bucks

 beautifully realized drama

 Congartulations for not being 100% Hollywood infected

 My brief review of the film

 The Million Dollar Baby....

 One of the best

 Tough Ain't Enough

 Great movie!
