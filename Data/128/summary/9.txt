 Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films

 Oh those golden childhood days...

 Another great film from Iran

 The Simple Things in Life

 Charming story with very revealing scenes of Irani culture

 A piece of neo-realism as moving as The Bicycle Thief

 Do Them Iranians Make Bad movies? I need to find one

 better leave some time for non-Hollywood

 seemingly dull plot but marvelous!

 Children of Heaven

 universal life

 Just about perfect

 Beyond what you expect

 A must see!

 Beautiful story

 tears in my eyes and smile in my face

 Made me smile from start to finish

 Incredibly Good!!

 Beautiful Poetic Imagery

 The Portrayal of Poverty

 Life's magic is in the simple things

 Simple but different

 Amazing "Neo-Realistic" Cinema

 marvelous and speechless..

 Heaven Can Wait.
