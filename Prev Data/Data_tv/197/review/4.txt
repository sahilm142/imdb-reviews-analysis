Why am i getting a bad dark vibe watching this show?Is it the premise? No, i don't think so. It's not another doctor TV show, i believe. Is it the looks? Nope, i like the visual. Is it the script? Nope. Script is good.So, what is it?.. and then i sense something..Too much 'dr. Thackery' in the show. Everyone, even the nurse is SO serious all the way. Is that how people in a hospital interacting with each other during that time? Come on..This show is trying too hard to be something it shouldn't be.. It kinda want you to dive into its world, but at the same time, it does not provide the necessary 'reality' to be believed into.Only two way to save this show.. 1) Put a zombie .. or 2) Please make Dr. Thackery die.. please..p/s: Clive Owen should be jumping out of a fast car, while shooting 3 heavily armed bad guys simultaneously... not a hopeless surgeon who have everything House had (except humor). Why Clive Owen? why?
