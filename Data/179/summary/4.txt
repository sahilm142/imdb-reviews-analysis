 Too Many Loose Ends

 Lifetime movie with a big budget

 David Fincher has nothing to say

 Good "Law and Order" episode, uncreative ending

 Seems like I have a minority opinion here...

 Too long and too contrived

 very disappointing finale

 Disappointing

 "Body Heat" + "Misery" = Meh

 Um, what?

 No go for me

 Very Disappointing - VERY.....disappointing....

 Deeply flawed film

 People get amazed with twists......so?

 Can't get behind Gone Girl (SPOILERS)

 Gone Numb

 Overrated with obvious holes in plot and very unsatisfying ending

 Must have run out of money

 shoddy character development

 A real B movie!

 Long movie for Nothing !

 The Film "Gone Girl" Is What "Gone Girl" Is About

 Convoluted Illogical Rubbish.

 Intriguing, well-paced mystery thriller that reveals itself to be Basic Instinct 2.0

 Where has David Fincher's talent gone....?
