Screenplay was really bad written. I do understand there was a lot of events to tell and in different times but the transition of time just didn't work.Very choppy. Besides this is a Racing Movie there was no racing excitement happening until just before the end of second Act. Characters personality were very shallow, they tried hard to define it but just didn't work. Niki Lauda German accent was way too strong which was very annoying and sometimes even hard to understand. Color Grading Vignette was overused and pull you out of the story instead of drag you in. Even though was directed by Ron Howard who is Academy Award winner it just didn't work for me at all.
