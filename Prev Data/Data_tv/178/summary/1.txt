 Disturbing non-stop

 Predictable, overrated, boring, and repetitive.

 Boring and over rated

 If it goes any slower it'll be going backwards

 Slow

 Don't, just don't

 Taking cheap shots

 Boring and somehow stupid

 It's not a comedy, but it is hilarious

 Good acting. Boring story. Very similar to others we have seen before

 This fruit is far from Blessed

 Not plausible

 Hahaha!!!!! Is this is a joke???

 Militant feminist propaganda

 Do not watch this show.

 Monotonous monotone monologues...

 Cringe

 This is a boring fiasco

 Dull as day-old dishwater

 People who give this show a high rating have brain damage

 Waste of time...

 Not enough material for one episode.

 Total garbage.

 Why

 Watch at your own peril.
