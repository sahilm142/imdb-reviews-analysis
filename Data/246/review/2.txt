I love to watch movies of Rajkumar Hirani and have never missed Amir Khan movie. They work so good that you have something always to watch and they kept their promise here too. **CLAPS**If you don't want spoiler please walk away.Goods: Direction and Acting. Full-stop.Rest All: This movie was so much OMG part 2 that they made bad-mix of religion and at sometimes it felt logical, other times it was just being atheist. All Alien fuzz with OMG movie thing is not working well. During start, movie is very interesting till just before interval. Later it was too boredom to carry. Biggest Negative I would say is that movie compares anyone to saints and shows that saints are by default corrupt and greedy personal. It was utter waste of money (Rs 350) which I paid. You can watch one-time and that too if you do not pay.Big dis-appointment!
I don't understand why these people feel so comfortable just BLINDLY going against the practices of Hindus. Have they tried to understand the meaning of of the different practices have they studied them. I am not saying there aren't flaws but its not all bad. These customs have meaning. Why is the villain in these type of movies always a hindu godman and not a Muslim mulla or Bishop. They are very comfortable talking against Hindus. 98% of the time it was against what Hindus do. Why don't they have the guts to make a film that was 98% against Muslims. What would happen? They would get banned in India like Satanic verses. There would be fatwas. Hinduism is the only religion that says that your god is also true. Each to his own. Where a form as well as formless both can be worshiped. Why did they not highlight the good in all the religions as well. They just took so much time just making fun of it ? The essence of all religions is the same, the could have brought out that instead of negating everything.Every one in the Pakistan embassy was shown to be so angelic.. really? PK is a waste of time. a big big waste of time. I don't trust IMDb reviews anymore.


                
This is a B movie at best, with annoying acting, annoying music (horrendous midi tracks all over the movie), an uninteresting plot and more importantly, addressing social aspects of Indian culture nobody outside of that country would actually care. It doesn't deserve this rating, and it is biased only by the fact so many Indian people have rated it with ridiculous scores.This is a minor, hyped, boring B movie. The interesting aspects are only the trivial aspects of it. For example is interesting to notice that Indian movies cast old actors with plastic surgery and lifting. Is interesting to see the mannerism adopted to shoot most of it, still the laughable music and story won't let you enjoy it as a story, but only as a display of cultural differences and desperate attempts at producing something that mocks the western world cinema.


                
For all the rave reviews it gathered, for all the appreciation it got, I found PK to be a below average fare at best. After all its Raju Hirani film and in no way you are gonna leave your brains at home. For the director who gave 2 of the masterpiece in Munnabhai and an excellent 3 idiots, I could not connect with its main protagonist as I did in earlier of his films. Yes Amir does his share of acting but every time he questions God, it reminded me of Paresh Rawal from Oh! My God, so the movie did not left any impact but instead it refreshed my memory of OMG. Remember those last scenes from both Munnabhai series, my heart still races when I see those scenes now, but PK did not left any of those types of impact. And that last scene where PK and that guru argue about God and Anushka goes on to call her long lost love around the world on national television, the film deviates from its point and that kind of ending is just unacceptable. Had I seen PK before OMG, 3 idiots and Munnabhai, it would have been a classic but for now its just a movie that is neither bad nor good.


                
No doubt, this film is much overrated and created much hype than that it deserves. The film shows the way we try to find god or interpret god is not right. The medium we use to reach god (babas, or any religious organizations) are mostly misleading. The way we think about reaching god is not right, actually that is a "wrong number" or a "cross connection". Very true.Anyway, i think this is the core of the film. But what is new in there? All these were addressed in Oh My God and was showcased in far far better way. PK raise questions in our heart - is it the right way we are trying to reach god? are those people who claims themselves as messenger of god are really genuine? it says we should start thinking and question ourselves before believing them blindly. Again what is new?Finally, PK proves the "baba" a wrong guy and also proves Sushant was not wrong in a highly dramatic way. Then PK returns home. Happy ending.At the end it remains a love story of Anushka and a put a question how we seek god. That is all about PK.May be it tried to demonstrate that only one truth is there and that is human and their love. But i feel PK lacks (or misses) that part. More ever it fetches a love story in exotic location (Belgium i believe), a terrorist attack which merely has to do anything with this film. Hence, i feel it misses its focus. If you watch Oh My God you know what the film is trying to speak. Surely Oh My God connects much much better.The reason i am comparing so much is i had a great expectation from Raju Hirani (after Munnabhai MBBS and 3 idiots). As he gives a new message and food for thought to its viewers. But this i found is a masala remake of Oh My God. Surely i would give it a huge rating if Oh My God was not released before this. Very much upset and frustrated this time. So, who has not watched Oh My God yet and think it is a masterpiece, please don't wait.Lastly, i would like to ask where in India will find so much of "dancing cars" :)
Full Bakwas.Recap of OMG / reused ideas.Poor acting or i should say over acting.Poor Direction.Poor Storyline and screenplay.Very Predictable.Intermission / 2nd half is very boring and annoying + predictable.Annoying and over used feel good background music.3 idiot's wining formula used again, but not working anymore.This movie is like OMG V2, completely mocking religions at the same time embarrassing it. They are using negative reinforcement and people are getting fool, again and again. A word to Bollywood , don't make religion mocking movie, make religion mocking documentary.


                
Another copied concept that Aamir uses to project his so called 'intelligent' film making. The soul of the concept (if this even has a soul) is a direct pickup from Kevin Spacey's K-PAX (2001). Wonder why there is a dearth of invention...and so much repackaging.The so called 'comedy with message' which neither makes people laugh nor completes the argument to a level an intelligent Indian audience is capable of debating. The actor should realize that his 50 year old 'uncool' demeanor has dramatic limitations and pushing it will only end up with making a fool out of himself. This movie joins the league of senseless projects that are shown to be successful because of their 'projected' box office numbers. The major revenue from Indians abroad is simply because they just like a couple hours of desi talk and song for a change, which they go in believing it will be senseless anyways. Indian audiences' strong buying power and lack of available alternatives make their sole trip to the cineplex ring the cash counter. Any silly act cannot be called entertainment. I do not remember any recent movie that has stayed on people's mind for more than a week. Why do we make such trace less movies?


                
I don't understand high rating for the movie! I don't know how many raters have watched "oh my god" but it was much better satirical movie on religions and of course without unnecessary love story plot. The songs of pk are very boring and scenes are repetitive at some places. And in the end the alien (AK) who does not understand "dancing cars" or even difference between man and woman, falls in love with Anushka! Of course, that's what made the movie to enter 400cr club! Acting wise everyone did fair job. Anushka looks fresh and Shushant fits into his tiny romantic role. Aamir did OK job but we have seen him in so many movies that he doesn't appear as different. Even though his look was altered to look like an alien. I liked other Raju's movies like 3 idiots and munnabhai series but this was not up to the mark!
This review is not going to be about the popular debate that had ensued about how this movie belittles religious feelings.This is about how the story unfolds. Seeing 8+ ratings, I was mislead to believe that this is a well made and thoughtful movie. Since there are a ton of other good movies that carry 8+ ratings on IMDb, and deserve it, PK certainly doesn't fall into that category.**Spoilers**1. Predictable - within a couple of minutes, any intelligent movie goer would be able to predict that when the lead actress received a letter that was not signed, it is indeed not for her. She doesn't call this person, the other person doesn't call her and then everything just vines together during a live TV show. 2. An alien species that knows how to build space ships, will hang a remote on the person going for a first contact to an alien land, instead of somehow embedding it into the person's body. In clear view. Up for grabs by the first ruffian the alien comes by. This is an insult to intellectual movie enthusiasts.3. What was the objective of the alien? Just to get his remote stolen and then find it? You get one chance to connect with another species, and then you waste it by crying about a lost remote. Further, the concept of God is something that the alien suddenly not only understand, but starts believing in (during the TV show, he makes a comment about this). I am going off the rails here.Of course, the movie was about delivering a message, but when you are about to gross INR 500 Crores (something that 99.99% of the Indian population hasn't even seen), isn't it worth it to put extra efforts to come up with a better and intelligent vehicle to deliver it?I applaud the Indian public for seeing past all these deficiencies and focusing on the message. I couldn't do so.
Honestly....I wonder why everybody is appreciating this movie. I mean Aamir has done a lot of great movies before but this one was a complete crap and i don't know why he chose this time. This movie has a lot of plot holes and flaws from the beginning. The script and story is a complete waste of time. I will tell you why it is bad: - Not so good story and bad screenplay. - Similar concept of Oh My God. Nothing amusing this time. - No character development (at all). - Jokes and humor (give me a break) - If you have good eyes then you will notice a bad CG. I mean in some scenes aamir didn't even shoot on set. Dhoom 3 had nice CG work.


                
Interval is the weakest thing in Hindi film industry. I will not write anything about the story. But the performances lack the punch unlike hirani's other films. the first half is just perfect. but second half spoils the game. The movie seems to be only of Aamir khan. The supporting actors are a waste of time.the songs are not good. the story is of a alien who does not know about this planet and have a few questions. The movie could or could not have been better. Raju Hirani took five years for a story and comes up with this. such a disappointing. strength:- Aamir khans acting, direction, story and screenplay.Weakness:- Songs, second half, irritating dialogues specially bhojpuri. Too many loo breaks.
Just finished this 2 hours 30 min long trash. I am Indian and love watching Hindi movies. But is this really a movie? Seriously? This is an awfully made flawed dumb stupid movie I have ever seen. I have grown up watching Hindi movies. But this is a trash and made for the people who have zero intelligence. Consider the following unanswered questions: 1. Why was P.K. sent to Earth? 2. From which planet P.K. came? 3. Why P.K. is naked? I understand that he says he comes from another planet where people don't wear clothes. But why does he come in the form of a human? What was the purpose? 4. The entire behavior of Amir Khan is comedic. Why an alien will behave like that? 5. He is searching for God. But why is he looking for God where he should be actually looking for the transmitter? 6. Why does he stare like that way? Is it supposed to be the look of an alien in the form of a human? I am utterly disappointed and sad that Amir Khan could have agreed to sign-up for such a movie. If the purpose of the movie was to show the emptiness of Hindu religion, that could have been done in an entirely different and more realistic way instead of bringing an alien in the form of a human being. I believe this movie will be regarded as one of the worst movies of Amir Khan.


                
To say that PK is Rajkumar Hirani's most disappointing film to date would not be incorrect. In all his earlier three films (Munnabhai MBBS, Lage Raho Munnabhai and 3 Idiots), he managed to convey a message and entertain effectively and effortlessly.But in this one, the struggle to make a point drains you out. Even though the film is two hours and 30 minutes long only, it just seems never-ending (especially in the second half). The similarities to Akshay Kumar-Paresh Rawal starrer Oh My God are just too many and that's where the film suffers, losing its novelty. Add to that, the preaching Hirani subjects us to with clichés like the Hindu-Muslim angle, India-Pakistan friction and religious differences; hold on, there's even a bomb blast that has no relevance with the story line.Anushka's romance with Sushant Singh Rajput and their subsequent break-up is the most amateurishly scripted love story this year. Sanjay Dutt has never been so badly miscast.
I have been watching every movie on the top 250 list, this being the 165th. It is the only one so far I couldn't stomach to the finish. The same message was delivered again and again with the same format - PK locks his bulging idiot eyes on a stereotype from Indian culture, cue goofy music, PK approaches the person and causes a massive fuss by assessing his situation at face value without knowledge of cultural nuances. Human culture, especially religion, is full of ridiculous contradictions. I get it. For the 100th time, I get the joke, now please stop insulting my intelligence!Aside from that issue, the story was not structured properly; characters were heavily developed and then abandoned from the plot for far too long. The journey for PK to hunt for his remote was a mere vehicle to lead him through a comprehensive spreadsheet of the aforementioned stereotypes (it would not surprise me if the screenplay began life as this spreadsheet), and I was distinctly aware of that fact while watching.From a technical perspective every shot in the movie was done very well. The music scenes were amusing. Those are the only positives I can come up with.The movie's high position in the rankings comes from the vast majority of reviews, user and critic alike, originating from one demographic. It's not for me to say their taste is wrong, but they definitely were looking for something different in this movie than I was. I would warn viewers more accustomed to western culture and less with Bollywood to have a backup ready if you choose to spend your night watching this, because you might find it as disappointing as I did.
I avoided all the hype surrounding this movie, and instead waited until it was on Netflix, four years after its release. I am glad I didn't spend my hard earned money on this piece of trash.There is a song from the 1959 movie "Dhool ka Phool", which goes as "Tu Hindu Banega Na Musalman Banega, Insaan Ki Aulaad Hai Insaan Banega", the gist of which is "One is just a human being irrespective of his/her religious upbringing". The movie takes this idea and stretches into a 2.5 hour worth of torture.The movie borrows its opening from "The Terminator", where an alien is sent to earth and hence, is completely naked. The rest of the movie is just the message "All religions are absurd, all humans are same" hammered again and again, until one looks forward for the movie to end.On his planet, the alien can communicate with fellow planet-people just by touching each other. Yet, this alien has the ability of vision, speech and hear sounds. We will let the evolutionary biologists discuss the intricacies of such evolutionary abnormality.The movie uses all the tired cliches to drive its pointForeign locales - check

Dysfunctional father - daughter relationship - checkSome of the events in movie take place in Bruges. I still don't understand what Bruges had to do with entire movie. Those events could have happened in Bombay or Karachi and could have still been relevant.Bollywood is not very well-known for being subtle in its movies, and this movie is no exception. In every scene, we are reminded about the inconsistency between the religious beliefs and religion being of no relevance to daily living.Acting wise - every major actor seems to think that one has to over act-over emote to be known as good actor. Nothing is normal - everything is over-the-top in the movie. Aamier wears a permanent exclamation on his face - yes Aaamir, we get it - you cannot understand the way people function on the planet. But I thought that after spending few weeks in Delhi, you might get used to the absurdity of life - at least an intelligent person would.Anyway, the movie appealed to masses and has raked in millions. So at this point, finding faults with this movie is moot. But if you still haven't watched movie, do yourself a favour, and instead spend time with your loved ones, pursue a hobby or just enjoy the life. You will be much happier.
