 The most relevant French film of the last 20 years

 Hate Begets Hate

 Better and Better

 Great achievement. One of the most unforgettable Euro movies of the 90's.

 this concerns everyone

 how can you sum up a film this beautiful & slick

 "La Haine"; Mathieu Kassovitz' stark social study of violence, fear and hatred, remains the powerful masterpiece it was in '95.

 great movie about social problems and how they're being dealt with

 Blew me away 10/10

 the most important thing isn't the fall but the landing

 Dull, dreary and pointless

 Excellent

 Masturbatory

 Fantasy

 Really easy to summarise......and very brief at that....

 Didn't do much for me

 The French's answer to Spike Lee

 Life in Black and White

 Alright

 This movie is for idiots!

 A French Classic of Indie Film

 The joke about the guy falling is like the movie...flat

 Gritty, Raw and Beautiful

 A bit overrated
