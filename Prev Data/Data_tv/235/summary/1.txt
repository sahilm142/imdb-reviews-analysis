 one of the stupidest shows i have ever seen

 It's nothing more than a Police Academy wannabe

 Just not good

 Am I supposed to laugh ?

 A new level of bad!

 El sucko!

 A disgraceful waste of one man's talent

 Dull, non-funny "comedy"

 No...just no!

 What a joke

 Constently Falls Short ...Sad

 Overrated, Hateable and annoying characters, Average Comedy.

 American trash tv

 Dump Andy Sandberg

 Good show, if you don't hear the background ringing

 Don't understand why it's rated so highly

 Scrubs in a police station

 Just awful
