 Overrated but still entertaining

 A little bit disappointing!

 interesting only once

 Absolutely mediocre!

 Good Anime that Lost a Chance to Become a Masterpiece

 The best typical Anime you'll ever find.

 Interesting till episode 25 then gets worse

 Amazing start and end, dissapointing last almost 10 episodes

 Easy intro to anime-extremely interesting story

 Suspenseful and clever

 Death Note: The Good And The Bad

 Amazing in the beginning

 I am Justice!

 Excellent and very close to original manga

 Started with a bang and ended up with a boom

 GREAT first 1/3 then plot holes and inconsistencies

 Great but not so much

 Highly overrated

 Great capacity for a good story although slugish in reality

 good but i overestimated it
