 Hollywood sterotypes galore!

 Bad filmmaking begets...good reviews? But how?

 Is everyone hypnotized?

 The characters are too unrealistic and cartoonish to take this movie seriously. And this is the main problem of this movie.

 Really!

 When The Critics Get It Wrong

 We did not see the same film.

 A LOT to overlook

 I don't understand all the good reviews!

 Poor Portrayal of Culture

 Very disappointed

 What?

 Completely Overrated Politically Correct Hodgepodge

 Are These Reviews Real?

 Not a good movie

 Not the Coen brothers

 Booooooo, men!!!

 Poor depiction of Missouri in a time we need much better

 Phoniest movie of 2017

 Seriously? What do people see in this?

 A poor mess of a dark nightmare with characters that are caricatures and a script without coherence and continuity

 Waste of two hours of my life

 overwrought pointless mess

 Really

 The main character ruined the film
