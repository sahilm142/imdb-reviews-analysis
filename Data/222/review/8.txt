"Monsters Inc" came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as "Toy Story", "A Bug's Life", "Shrek", and "Disney's Tarzan" are in. First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real. Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy "kitty" with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall an hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn't even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk. You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer. Almost like being in a theater!!


                
Set in a world of Monsters, where the most scary thing is a human child, there is a shortage of Power at the the Scream factory, a place where Monsters enter our world through the closets of young children to collect their Screams.Sully (John Goodman) the Top Scarer, stumbles upon a child who has somehow entered our world, with his buddy Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) Sully finds out that Human Children are not as dangerous as they are made out to be. And there is more to the Scream Factory than meets the eye.Brilliantly animated, with some hilarious characters, Monsters inc is another Pixar Delight for the whole family8/10


                
Such originality from Pixar again. Creating an entire world to get lost in. The characters are lovable and the storyline to fit. A brilliant film


                
Oh man, watching this film again filks me with so much nostalgia. I remember watching this film so many times when it was on tv. I really love the story and characters. Even the anination is still pretty good. It may not be as amazing as when I was a kid, but it's still a great film I 100% recommened. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BE>


                
Like all Disney/Pixar movies, Monsters Inc. manages to blend just the right amount of adventure with emotional character. The end of the movie brings tears to the eye with just one word. That is what makes Disney and Pixar so powerful. The movie is fun to watch, the plot flows well, and the characters have enough depth. Character relations are well-put together and creative.8/10


                
This is actually the first movie I remember watching in the cinema. How wild is that? I remember the cinema, that I went with my grandmother, where we sat, what it was like watching the film. It was a wild experience.


                
Monsters , Inc is just one of the proofs that Pixar does not disappoint , here in my opinion the best duo of Pixar , Mike and Sully , the coolest movie monsters , animation as well as all Pixar has a good story, in that film tells a child's friendship and a monster, the voice work is great , the soundtrack fits the film is quite funny , the character Mike is great fun , Boo and very cute , very good their scene with abominable Snow, and at the end of the film makes you want a sequel (which unfortunately never had (only Monster University passing before) , Monsters , Inc is one of the best Pixar , great fun and has the best pair of Pixar. Note 8.5
The premise behind Monsters, Inc. isn't something that we haven't seen before, but it is one that allows for a lot of creativity and one that the film takes full advantage of. Pixar was still in a relatively early stage when the film came out, yet it was the perfect way to show that their imagination knew no bounds. It centres on two monsters at a company whose job it is to scare children because the monster world is powered by the screams of children. Now that is a really inventive idea. But their world is thrown into disarray when a child called Boo gets out (with monsters believing children are toxic) and our two heroes have to get her back, all while not being found out and uncovering a wider conspiracy. This leads to a story packed full of twists and turns, plenty of comedy and action set pieces, and a surprising emotional heft.The story itself allows for a vast amount of creativity with the concept of monsters having this kind of job, all the unique designs and the fact that they are terrified of children. It is also great how detailed the story is, because you simply never know where it's going or how it's going to end up and its constantly gripping as a result of that. The two leads are vital to the story and thankfully they are both great. Sulley is the company's top scarer, yet on the inside he's just a big teddy bear and there is something so endearing about him. He's a really warm screen presence and seeing his relationship with Boo grow throughout the film is strangely beautiful. Mike is much more of a wise-cracker and somewhat neurotic, which actually makes him a great contrast to Sulley. He does provide a lot of laughs and the friendship with Sulley feels very genuine. In fact both John Goodman and Billy Crystal deserve praise for giving such excellent performances.It's also impressive how well Boo is handled. Usually very young children can be annoying or plain boring, but she is the right balance of curious and gentle whilst still having enough funny moments. The fact that she speaks in a muddled sort of baby talk is another positive and actually makes her more endearing. Most notable is her relationship with Sulley, as it is build up just perfectly and their final moments together are incredibly touching. That emotional core between is a real strong point of the film. The films comedic moments are very well done too. Mike relies much more on his witticisms and anxious behaviour to get laughs which works surprisingly well, while the other monsters ineptitude when it comes to scaring also provides a great number of amusing moments.With that said one of the films few weaknesses are its villains. They're not bad, just a little one-dimensional and underdeveloped. Randall is a typically snide and aggressive rival, we don't learn anything about him and he doesn't really do much but try to hunt down Boo. He either needed to be funnier or more threatening to leave an impression. Waternoose also turns out to be involved in the plot despite his initial loyalty to Sulley, his conflict does make sense yet he is also a little underused. Despite that he does have a good design and James Coburn does a good job vocal. That said their actions do lead to a spectacular climax. It basically has Sulley and Mike frantically searching for Boo's door in what is effectively a gigantic room of doors. It's fun, it's exciting, it's tense, it is exactly the type of big climax you'd want the film to have. The animation is excellent once again. The fact that its set in a world of monsters allows for some really interesting and colourful designs, the majority of monsters look unique and are memorable as a result of that. Just looking at Sulley, the amount of detail put in with all his hairs is so impressive. We don't see too much of the monster world, but the factory is an interesting setting and still permits plenty of creativity. The side characters are a bit hit-and- miss, although the Abominable Snowman (Pixar regular John Ratzenberger) gets some really good lines and the cranky receptionist Roz is enjoyable. Randy Newman's score has an effective light, jazzy feel to it and it is brilliant. Not only does it suit the tone of the film, but it also adds a nice energy to the more action packed scenes and provides some wonderfully emotive melodies.So on the whole Monsters, Inc. is another big success for Pixar. I think that it works so because it gets the key areas right. The premise is interesting, the two leads are a great pairing, the main conflict is gripping and there is a strong emotional centre to the film that makes it even stronger. It is easy to care about these characters and want to see them succeed. I do think the villains are a bit weak and maybe the conspiracy is a little unneeded, but neither does too much damage to the overall product and that is because its central focus is so good. Added to that the animation, score and comedy all work fantastically to the best effect. It's a film that is funny, moving and engaging in all the right ways.


                
Monster's Inc. (2001): Dir: Pete Docter / Voices: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Tilly, John Ratzenberger: Delightful animation about change in attitudes and lifestyles. It regards the manufacturing of doors that portal the monsters into a child's room to scare them. The screams power their city. Top scare is Sully, a big blue hairy creature coached by a green eyeball with limbs named Mike. The villain the lizard-like Randall who can blend in with his surroundings. Central plot regards a little girl who accidentally enters their world, and Sully and Mike's struggle to conceal her. Amusing idea trails into formula. Inventive conclusion with imaginative directing by Pete Docter. Terrific vocal work by John Goodman and Billy Crystal as Sully and Mike. Sully is famed as the top scare monster while Mike is sort of his manager. Now they are met with a dilemma to help this young girl and discover that laughter is a much more powerful energy. Steve Buscemi voices Randall in what is the standard villain but his punishment fits the crime with amusing results. Jennifer Tilly voices a Meduca-like figure who acts as the romantic interest to Mike. The role is perhaps the weakest in the film. John Ratzenberger makes a great cameo voicing the Abominable Snowman who desires a change in the perception of him. Theme visualizes that there is more power in love than fear. Score: 8 ½ / 10
Pixar have, it seems, done it again. Coupled with breath-taking animation and a superb storyline, Monsters, Inc. has achieved something truly incredible- a film able to entertain not only children, but those 'over the hill' too.The basic plot is that there is another universe, full of the monsters that one sees in childhood hiding under your bed or in your closet. These monsters go to all different parts of the world through portals in the doors to be able to scare the children, and in return collect the children's screams, as it is, for them, a form of energy. But chaos ensues when a little girl is accidentally let into the Monster World, and a more sinister plan is revealed...The voice acting, for one, is superb, with each character's personality shining through magnificently. The actors were chosen well, with John Goodman as the cheery James P. Sullivan, and Billy Crystal providing the voice of the marmite-esquire character Mike Wazowski. (Marmite because you either love his quirky jokes, or hate his boastful nature.) Also, a kudos has to be given to Steve Buscemi for playing the sinister, yet, in my opinion, weirdly lovable character of Randall Boggs- his voice fits perfectly.All in all, this film is definitely not one to be missed, and deserved all of the praise it has received.


                
Pixar strikes the imagination mother lode again with "Monster's Inc."  The movie has a pleasing premise that monsters scare little children so the monsters can harness the children's screams as energy to run their monster world.  The story follows the monsters' top "Scarer" Sully and how he becomes a new man, er, monster when a very cute little girl named Boo comes into his life.The animation is incredible.  I'm amazed at how freakish monsters could express human emotions so effectively and with sincere affectation. "Monster's Inc." doesn't have as many laughs as the Toy Story movies but it made me feel just as good.  Recommended.


                
Another great movie from the Disney/Pixar team.  It has the unique story which is great for both children and adults.  All the little touches throughout the film depicting the Monstropolis world are inventive and fun. It did not go for parody overload like Shrek did, but instead went with understated quality.  These things were not flooding the screen, but were placed here and there so that it would reward one who catches them.For the story to be an offshoot of children's imagination and expand to a whole world based on that is very imaginative.  The rest of the film has it all, being clever, witty, heartfelt, edge of your seat action and suspense.Another inventiveness is the the musical during the ending credits, which is the off-shoot of what Wazowski and Sully made up during their cover-up, as opposed to Shrek's kareoke after the movie, which has nothing to do with the film.The other great part of Disney is that the personalities of each character takes on the being they are portraying.  Although this film cannot follow that format since almost all the characters were monsters and we could only assume how they act in real life (as opposed to a caterpillar or a fish.) But it also allows the animator to be limitless in their interpretation of the monsters physical attributes and the way they act, although in some parts, Billy Crystal has to be Billy Crystal.  On top of that, Boo character just stole our heart.In all, a great movie for every member of the family to enjoy.


                
There's very few movies that I'd see based solely on a name attached to it. One of these would be a film by David Fincher and another would be a film by Pixar. Pixar produced "Toy Story" and, funnily enough, "Toy Story 2". Anyone who has seen those classics will realize that that is more than enough to make you go and see "Monsters, Inc."How does the movie live up to the legacy of Pixar? Mostly pretty damn well. Firstly it looks wonderful - animation in movies is constantly improving and here we can see how Pixar have been able to enhance details such as the fine movement of hairs on Sully's body. At the same time the movie is able to feel like an animation - it has no pretensions about trying to be real as the characters are animated with extra-large-wide eyes, disproportionate heads, etc. The characters in here are not as good as in the "Toy Story" series. That's the film's biggest flaw. They're not as cleverly drawn or as diverse. Certainly we have no cynical Woody with whom the adults of the audience can relate to. Sully is the gentle-lovable-lug and Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is the wise-cracking-side-kick. It's an old and popular formula because it works. The villain of the piece is Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) and he's about as one-dimensional as they come which is no more than you'd expect for a movie aimed for the child's market. Boo - the child of the movie - is adorably cute without every being irritatingly so. You can't help but love her and she's the nicest piece of the cast. However in the end I found the cast somewhat unmemorable and the voice-over talent weren't used to their full capabilities (Buscemi could certainly let rip as a cold, calculating villain had be been able to). However a comedy lives and dies by it's script and here "Monsters, Inc." is very good. Some comments here suggest that the humour is aimed for children and is thus a hit-and-miss affair with adults but that's a load of cobblers - I was in a packed theatre and every single person was laughing. The humour really kicks into key when Boo - the child who accidentally stumbles into the world of "Monsters, Inc." - arrives on the scene and causes havoc by merely wandering around. The concept of the movie - that their world is powered by the screams generated by the monsters that come out of the cupboard to scare children - is wonderful but the final plot resolution is painfully obvious (I know, it's a kids movie but even so...). The script is very well paced and there's plenty of diverting action. Admittedly the humour isn't as clever as "Shrek" - there's none of the sly referencing or winks to the older audience - but it's still pretty quick and the out-takes over the closing credits are fantastic."Shrek" is the only recently comparable piece to "Monsters, Inc." and "Shrek" slightly wins out by virtue of acknowledging it's older audience and having slightly better characterization. That aside "Monsters, Inc." is the best comedy I've seen released this year by a long shot and is well well *well* worth seeing. A very firm 8.3/10.


                
Pixar has released its first mediocre film with Monsters Inc. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. But it lacked the sense of wonder of Toy Story, the character strength of A Bug's Life and the zest of Toy Story 2. This movie has some great scenes and fills the screen with wonderful images, but it falls short of its predecessors.Maybe living up to the first three Pixar features is an impossible task.Monsters Inc. has a wonderfully original premise. Monstropolis, the land where monsters live, generates its power from the screams of children. Monsters Inc. is a power plant where the most talented "scarers" pop through closest doors though a portal into a child's bedroom anywhere on earth. They scare, the kids scream, the monsters leave and Monstropolis has their power. A problem arises - kids just don't scare that easy any more. Only the top scarers are getting results. (As the ads say "We scare, because we care.")There are two masterworks of animation in this film. The first is Billy Crystals character, Mike, who is essentially an eyeball with legs and arms. But even with these limited features, Mike still has phenomenal body language and facial expressions. The second is Waternoose, the boss at Monsters Inc voiced by James Cockburn. Waternoose is this giant, multi-eyed thing in a business suit that creeps along on crab legs, but projects the image of "the boss" while still being creepy. Amazing.I found Randall, the villain, just not bad enough. To be a Disney villain, you have to live up to the standards set by the likes of Ursula, Uncle Scar, the Wicked Witch and Jafar and Randall just doesn't cut it.Still a strong recommendation for this film. There are some fabulous visuals, most notably the wild ride through the warehouse of doors, and it sports a very original premise and works it well. I will never think of the number 2319 the same ever again.***1/2 out of ****.


                
Disney/Pixar movies always work best on the "funny + heart" formula. "Monsters, Inc.", while not absolutely perfecting that formula, works well enough to produce another solid animation effort.For a basic plot summary, this movie poses that the "monster in the closet" you were scared of as a kid was indeed real and just trying to scare you to collect your screams, which powers their entire industry. One "routine day at the Monster scare factory", however, top scare-er Sulley (John Goodman) and pal Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) bring a small girl back into their own world, wreaking havoc along the way and learning a pretty valuable lesson in the process.To be sure, "Monsters, Inc." is a great animation effort. It is witty (for both adults and children), full of action/adventure, and has a lot of heart/emotions weaved into the proceedings. Especially standing out here is the voice acting from Crystal and Goodman, whose characters have such a great report with each other.The only reason I give the movie four stars instead of five is because, unlike the top tier of Disney/Pixar efforts like Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo, and Up, this one shies away from the take-home message when it could have embraced it. For example, and I'll try to be as spoiler- free as possible here, towards the end of the movie the two leads make a discovery (which is hinted at throughout the film) that will change the "Monster world" forever. Instead of really delving into the consequences of that revelation, however, the producers choose to "keep things simple" and not get too deep. I think they could have gone a little deeper and doing so would have vaulted this one into the upper echelon.Overall, though, "Monsters, Inc." is a fun film that the entire family can enjoy. While it may not be the absolute best of its kind, it is still easily better than most.


                
In a review that I had deleted, I described Monsters, Inc. as somewhat disappointing for its lack of unsettling imagery, with only a handful of scenes that actually made me jittery. But know that I have seen this movie again, I only now realized what this was meant to be; a family film that places peeving imagery aside and leaves us with some well executed jokes and designed characters, especially James Sullivan (whose fur rendering is so strong even to this day). Sure, some of the humor is catered more towards the younger audiences, and some aspects of the monster world aren't explored well (such as how monsters of all designs share the same shape of toilets, vehicles, et cetera, excluding those already explored in its chronological predecessor) but they will focus on that more than the subplots such as Celia's relationship with Mike. The roles are (no pun intended) monstrously performed to what they were intended, and perhaps more, which can't be found in a lot of movies specifically targeted at kids today. Now that I realize what I skipped in my previous review, I feel as despondent as Boo when Sulley returns her to her bedroom. If not for the questionable world they live in, this is a film that I am complacent to say that families must watch it.
***spoiler**** All of children don't like monsters because they are so agree, dirty and they eat them, but indeed the monsters also don't like human. In this film, you can see and understand the thought and the habit of the monster. First, they think that human have risky sick so if they touch us they have to clean themselves; they washes themselves and cut their fair. Secondly, they use our fear as the energy; they surprise us to gather our fear. But they are kind if we are accepted as a friends and they protect us, even though they are in danger; SULLY he is a big blue monster protects a child she is a lead character, despite he is in danger of losing his working. In this film, you are always stick to BOO, leading character, because she is so cute and so pretty. When the BOO parts from the monsters, you can't see the scene without crying. And you don't have to the partnership of SALLY and MMIKE. They solve the problems together with covering their weak point. If you like this film, you should see the part 2, in which you can see how to meet the lead character's monsters.
If there's anything that "Monsters Inc." proves is that the greatest stories, whether targeting a young or older audience (or both within the same person), all rely on a simple yet original concept. It's so simple in the film that you can almost guess it from the title.What kind of products or services a company named "Monsters, Inc." can provide? Well, what do monsters do best? They scare... but as the tag-line says, it's only business. And like every business, you need a target. Kids, who else? But the real question is : what kind of business would require them to scare poor helpless little kids? Well this is where it gets tricky, in fact children's screams supply Monstropolis' daily needs of energy, as simple as that. Their slogan says "We scare, because we care", so all these monsters provide a necessary public service, and that one of their rules is to never get in contact with the children shows how actually harmless and worthy of our sympathy they are (or are they? ... suspenseful music).And to add to the enjoyment of a very creative premise, the exposition is a delightful sequence too, plunging us in a world populated by monsters, each one being a gag by himself. Indeed, I could easily figure out the instructions given to the artists during the making-of : "every single monster must be unpredictable, different, funny and somewhat memorable" so we get a succession of animal-like creatures with the most bizarre or sophisticated physical attributes, big, small, invisible, hideous, you name them. And leading the show, we have Sulley and Mike (yeah, it's an Americanized parallel universe, what's the matter?). Sulley is big blue furry one with purple spots, cool and friendly, and Mike the little green Cyclopes, wisecracking and talkative. And don't ask me which of the gentle giant and the Napoleon syndrome guy is voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. Please, don't.To complete the imagery, the film is all about imagery anyway, some others monsters are such masterpieces of creativity they shouldn't even be called monsters. Like Celia, Mike's girlfriend, voiced by Jennifer Tilly, and whose dreadlocks-like hair are made of adorable little snakes with reactions that almost match their owner (almost). From the ugly sight of the bulged-eye chameleon-like Randal Boggs whose ability to change color borrows more from the invisible man powers, it's easy to guess who's the movie's bad guy and who dubs him of course? Simply, the most funny-looking actor with the same weird-looking eyes : Steve Buscemi. A final honorable mention for James Coburn who voices the CEO Mr Waternoose, a crab-like cigar-smoking head of company who treats his best monster Sulley like a son and Roz, a daunting secretary with a ravaged-by-smoking voice that sounds like scratching fingers on a chalkboard.And all this colorful gallery works in "Monsters Inc." following a daily routine that coincides with Earth children's bedtime, the company provides a warehouse full of millions of doors from all over the world and each one leading to kids' bedrooms, a parallel universe we're most familiar with or used to. And this is where the little Disney magic works again : the film rings that sensitive chord reminding us the time from our childhood when we were afraid ghosts or monsters would come from the closet. Well, I was more afraid of clowns or wild animals and I was more staring at the window with fearful eyes, but psychologically speaking, that's not the point.So, let's get back to "Monsters, Inc.". Like any company, they have to face real market issues, one of them is kids growing more and more insensitive to violence, this is why they only hire the best of the best, the monster's 'right stuff' as suggested by the hilarious slow-motion sequence parodying the famous astronaut-walking scene. And apparently, Sulley is about to break the company's record, closely followed by his jealous rival, Randall. But one of Randall's evil schemes allows Sulley to discover that there's one little child he does't scare, a little girl nicknamed 'Boo' who grew an instant fondness on Sulley, inversely proportional to the fear Boggs inspired her. From fear to realization, Sulley also develops feelings toward Boo, and we know where this is leading, that drop of tear for an ocean of thrills and laughs, made-in-Disney.The third Pixar movie is another little touchstone of creativity and imagery that will delight kids and adults. It's good, it's even great at times, yet it lost to "Shrek" that year, and rightfully so, for Shrek had a less sophisticated concept but treated with more wit and heart. And a parody of fairy material could only win over a concept that, as creative as it is, relies on one gimmick. "Monsters, Inc" has heart too, and some moments between Sully and Boo will make a few eyes cry. But somehow, the film was victim of its own concept, and commits many mistakes with the whole door and closet systems, thus featuring a series of plot contrivances at the crucial final act. Not to mention the little resolution that plays like a nice twist but is revealed to early in the film to leave an impact.Still, a very good film.


                
I've been wanting to review this movie for some time now, and that is because Monsters Inc. is already a beloved classic from the company that makes us dream like no other. With this movie it's no different. We are introduced to a world that is inhabited by monsters who are just trying to live their normal lives in a happy society. Our main characters are Mike and Sully, two creatures that work at Monsters Inc. , whose goal is to power the city with children's screams. When a little girl crosses the threshold of both worlds, trouble will arise as friendships and the overall faith of Monstropolis (the city's name) will be on the line. Providing a perfect mixture of comedy and warmth, this movie delivers an entertaining ride that will leave you laughing out loud, as well as invested in the emotional trials the characters goes through. The film's lasting message is also one of the best in showing us that through a happy spirit we can overcome anything. Pixar at their best, Monsters Inc. is a must see movie for any animation and ,most of all, Pixar enthusiast.Rating: 9/10


                
"You hear that? Sounds like fun in there. Well, see ya kid. Send me a postcard. That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 Mike Wazowsi-You-Got-Your- Life-Back-Lane." "Mowki Kowski". "Very good. Now bon voyage. See ya."Not quite a Pixar classic, but marvelous! "Monsters Inc." is as fresh and exciting today as it was when it was first released (2001). Directed by Pete Docter, "Monsters, Inc." is an example of the Pixar creativity combined with Walt Disney magic. "Monsters, Inc." is a animated film full of ingredients to please children and adults. In the Portuguese version, voiced by Fernando Luís (Sulley) and João Baião (MikE), THIS IS THE MOVIE OF MY CHILDHOOD!


                
Loved it! This is the type of movie that has it funny parts and parts that also warm the heart. A great family movie but also a great movie for all ages to enjoy. With a awesome all star line-up providing the voice overs for each character, adding in their own personal flavor, I assure you that you will be thoroughly entertained.I personally gave the movie an 8 out of 10 for humor, a great story line, and the ability to hold my attention and my son's attention. Already made it one of our many Disney movie selections when we have family time once a week. But if you don't want to take my word for it, go get the movie and give it a try.


                
animation and the fur work is very nice.... ..i like 1 st part movie more than this movie but overall is good to see again those character ...... and wanna see again n againThis is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too. more over we enjoy a lotThere is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too.


                
I thought monsters inc was an amazing film i watched when i was a kid. They got the right actors to be in this film. I believe the actors in this film got along. Boo is my favorite character. I hope they do more films like monsters inc because they are really good. Randel was so nice in monsters university then he turned on mike that was so mean. I couldn't believe Ross was in Monsters university Monsters inc was way better then monsters university The animation in both of the films were so different I recommend you should watch it And make your own review I love watching movies so you should watch both of those films because they are good. And finally you should rate both of the films. Thanks for looking at my review


                
The voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.There is some great dialog but the true power of "Monsters, Inc." are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!
A world full of monsters that just got expanded with a sequel not too long ago. And the introduction to this world was the best thing about this film. One of the finest efforts in the Pixar universe. The idea of children as energy sources is the core of the film and possibly the main reason why it succeeds so impressively. The doors as means of transit from the monster world into the human world. The simulators where the not-so-experienced monsters can improve their abilities. It all oozes creativity. Another strength of this film is that its supporting characters are at least as interesting as the two monsters in the lead. I don't think we need to talk about Mike and Sully much. Their actions and presence speak for themselves. One is huge, furry and truly scary, yet kind-hearted, the other is tiny, slippery (at least that's what he looks like, like a frog), always funny and obviously a bit of a womanizer. And yet, they're best friends. Beyond these two,the monster world includes creatures of all sizes, shapes and colors, so they're a feast visually, but with some the writers also succeeded to make them truly entertaining and effective. The two antagonists are really a scary presence, thanks to their looks with all those tentacles for example on Coburn's character or their ability to turn invisible (Buscemi). Two more I liked: One would be Mike's girlfriend who gave me a true LOL-moment when she talks during the date about how she may be interested in a shorter haircut and we see those snakes that actually are her hair go into full panic mode for a moment. The other is the poor Monster Inc. worker who got showered and sheared when they discover a baby sock on his back. His reaction when there is one on his back again later into the film was pretty hilarious. Well done. The exterminators were pretty hilarious too, even if you didn't see any physical trademarks on them as they were all covered by their huge uniforms. There's just so many great characters and I'm certainly forgetting some. Already all those they see when they go to work. Thankfully Sully kept Mike from taking the car, otherwise we would have missed all these.When the whole part of introducing us to the monster world ends and the real story starts with the little girl enters the picture, it gets slightly worse, but only because it was so great before. Boo is still the cutest thing ever (gotta love how she keeps saying Mike's name) and the way Sully slowly grows paternal feelings for her is displayed with lots of heart. Afterwards we see the usual ingredients, the villains seemingly gaining the upper hand, characters being exposed as surprisingly good or bad, the main characters' friendships put to test, Sully to Boo and Sully to Mike etc. The latter actually happens in the Himalayas and features a funny cameo of the The Abominable Snowman and his snow cones. The only thing from the film which did not really interest me, was the action sequence and all the main characters riding on the doors on their fight for little Boo. That felt really only for children in the audience again. I won't complain though as not only the way the two villains got it in the end (crocodile reference, simulator exposure) and the twist of turning the scream factory into a laughter factory were very well-made again and the epilogue with Mike having built the door to Boo fully together will hopefully give you an equally warm feeling in your chest as it did for me. "Boo?" "Kitty!" with the huge smile entering Sully's face was truly a perfect way to end the movie. Easily among Pixar's best and very much recommended for people all ages.
