Review of the Complete Miniseries: DAS BOOT is a film which prides itself on its intense realism as it explores the trials and tribulations of a German submarine crew in the Atlantic during the Second World War. The lengthy running time of this miniseries allows us to really get to know a group of tough but human characters, presided over by the excellent Jurgen Prochnow as the captain who struggles to hold it all together.This is a slow production for at least half of the running time as it strives to put across the boredom suffered by men who are trapped in an underwater sardine can for weeks on end. Despite the lethargic pacing, it's never dull; Wolfgang Petersen's direction is gripping, even in the quiet moments. And when the action hits, as it does, it's all the more impressive and terrifying because of the long build up.DAS BOOT is a claustrophobic and often terrifying thriller that really puts across what its like to serve in a submarine. The underwater action is familiar from other productions - there are only so many things that can happen to a submarine in wartime, after all - but it's all done so professionally and, well, properly, that it remains fascinating to watch. The scene with the men on the burning boat is my favourite, but the powerhouse climax is equally moving. It's a must-see WW2 adventure and I'd recommend watching the longer 'director's cut' instead of the movie version. I feel inclined to check out the even longer 'uncut version' at some point...
