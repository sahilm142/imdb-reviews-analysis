 What happened??

 A Viking soap show

 It started great but now....

 First 4 seasons 10/10, then it went downhill in season 5...

 Decent enough, though quite flawed

 Poorly Written and Executed Hollywood Soap Opera

 Not wery good.

 Started out good but became progressively worse by catering to feminists

 History should be accurate, not just entertaining!

 God awful

 Falls Flat Now

 Predictable plot

 Enjoyable but below expectation

 season 3 is a travesty

 Season 5 is the worst ever !

 Vile things.

 would've been disappointed if I would've expected something

 The word "Raunchy" comes to mind

 Nothing but blood and killing

 Doesn't Deserve the High Ratings It's Claiming Here

 What You Wish is What You Get....Very Conveniently

 Could be better.
