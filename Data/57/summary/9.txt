 Every positive word written about this movie is absolutely true

 Excellent film, insightful character studies

 A great movie about mediocrity, thoroughness, morality and power.

 Others' Lives

 Character development

 Profound tale of morality.

 You'll be watching it like the Stasi!

 Chilly, bleak, brilliant

 Beautifully restrained study of moral complexity and totalitarianism

 not such a bad film, after all

 "Sonate vom guten Menschen" also made this reviewer dewy-eyed!

 Lives of Others........ don't miss this one!!

 Sat with a smile on my face!

 Powerful human movie that everyone must see

 Beauty in the darkest of circumstances, is the most beautiful of all.

 Terrific screenplay and solid performances for a powerfully gripping drama

 Some movies simply tell the truth - this is one.

 Probably the best film of 2006

 Stasi a lesson to us all

 Another great German movie

 A film which will remain for decades in our minds..

 Undoubtedly, deserved an Oscar

 A German Masterpiece!

 An emotional drama...

 Strong Characters, Great Performances
