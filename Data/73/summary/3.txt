 an over-rated movie

 How is this #1

 NOT the greatest movie of all-time, and not even close

 Why I don't like this movie.

 don't expect all that

 Totally forgettable...and I mean totally.

 The most over rated soap in history.

 Point Please?

 Weird, but interesting

 Possibly the most overrated movie ever...

 Overrated tosh by an overrated filmmaker.

 why do the people like it?

 Interesting but very dated.

 Rosebud!!!

 Citizen Kane - Great in the black & white era, not now.

 Maybe it only is generation gap

 Decent, but rather boring

 what's the fuzz about this show?

 Just don't get it..

 Overrated

 "Rose Bud" is a "Rose Dud"
