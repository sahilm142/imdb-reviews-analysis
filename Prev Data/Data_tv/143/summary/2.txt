 Season 2 cobbled together

 Disappointing

 Meh..

 NETFLIX destroyed another Marvel hero sequel season with a garbage PC snooze fest

 Punished myself by watching it

 If you're a Punisher fan, not for you

 Season two is a PC snooze fest!

 This concerns only Season 2

 We got a soap opera instead of the show we wanted

 Crap plot, crap acting and crap ending

 boring

 This is drama not action (and not Punisher)

 I truly do not understand positive reviews

 Hollywood junk-writing

 Anti-U.S. Military and anti-American liberal wet-dream

 A predictable story arc with superviolence
