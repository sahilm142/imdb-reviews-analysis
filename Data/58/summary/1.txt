 How I learned to stop watching and love other Kubrick-films

 Life of Brian had me laughing more in the first 2 minutes than during this entire movie.

 Rubbish

 Overrated and not funny

 The Best Comedy of All Time?

 Don't Expect Comedy

 I didn't get it.

 Am I missing something?

 Most overrated movie in IMDB

 Among the worst movies (all aspects) I have seen

 Worst Movie Ever

 What a load of BS

 Another Kubrick Debacle

 Not for Anyone

 What did I miss?

 Really boring comedy film

 This movie is very, very poor due to being Out-dated

 IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!

 overrated pile pooh

 Don't overrate movies, please.

 comedy??????????

 reality check

 The release date and directors name means nothing
