 Perfect Television (only a network executive couldn't love it)

 Best show about young people in a long time.

 Excellent acting, great music and good storylines.

 Too exceptional to be allowed to remain on TV!

 Great little show!

 One of the few gems in network TV

 A Classic (In my mind anyway)

 Long live William McKinley High School, 1980! (minor spoilers)

 It's a shame they took this off the air...

 One of the best shows of all time.

 Quite possibly the best show in TV history

 Best High School series I've ever seen...

 Brilliant

 Ahead of its time...

 This generation's Wonder Years

 Great, original, true. Watch it get canceled.

 Love, love, love this nostalgic high school comedy

 I'm eighteen and I don't know what I want.

 One of the best T.V shows I have ever seen.

 Newer review - still a great show!

 None of the 18 episodes disappoints

 Excellent

 The most relatable TV show I've ever watched

 Not life - changing, but life explaining

 The entire high school experience in eighteen episodes
