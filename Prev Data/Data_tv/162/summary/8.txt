 Fascinating, Suspenseful Drama Exploring The Origins Of Criminal Psychology And Profiling

 Dont listen to the commenters giving low ratings.

 How can we get ahead of crazy if we don't know how crazy thinks?

 very thoughtful and interesting - its a "think piece"

 Glad I pushed play! Slow-burning, suspenseful, well-acted.

 An almost excellent binger

 Season One Review

 Excellent show. I'd have liked a little more darkness though.

 It isn't 7even 2.0

 Mind hunter Review

 Great start, stumbling finish.

 Mindhunter distinguishes itself in a crowded genre with ambitiously cinematic visuals and a meticulous attention to character development

 Slow pacing bur binge worthy

 Great

 Inside the mind of psychos

 very different kind of crime show

 Cameron Britton is the MVP of the show

 That final episode was chilling

 Good plot but room for improvement

 A gem of a police psychological thriller

 One of Fincher's best?

 Very good

 Effective, interesting and tense

 A chilling new Netflix show

 The Birth of Criminal Profiling Brought To The Small Screen In An Excellent Way
