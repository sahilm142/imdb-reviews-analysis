 Watch it for the characters, not the medicine!

 Very Good and Getting Better

 everybody lies..

 Some observations about this show...

 For Hugh Laurie fans only

 One season too many

 If you watch just a few episodes, it's OK

 Surprisingly good

 Back on Track

 I love this show!

 Great dialogue, so-so narrative

 On the whole, good but moments of brilliance are separated by unfortunate mediocrity

 First medical drama I've seen that delves into the actual sickness of a patient.

 It's worth a look.

 It's all about Hugh Laurie

 1st season very good, seasons 2 and 3 got old quickly - avoid the rest

 I oppose killing and cutting a lovely rat in a part of the series

 Medical American Sherlock?
