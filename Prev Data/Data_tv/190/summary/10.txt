 The best TV drama serial ever? - "You might very well say that, I couldn't possibly comment"

 Nothing short of BRILLIANT!!!

 A fantastic series - entertaining, dark and relevant

 A truly excellent film.

 Best political thriller I've seen so far

 The Rise Of Francis Urquhart

 One of the best

 You might well think that, I couldn't possibly comment.

 Francis Urquhart, a modern day Rasputin

 Great Fun for the Intellect and Libido

 The best BBC production of all time

 Brilliant Inside-the-Head Thoughts and Intrigue of British Politics 10 Years Before "the West Wing"

 Doesn't come crashing down

 Cynical, droll, and brilliant. The marriage of a brilliant character and performance.

 Ian Richardson is still my "daddy"!

 Impressive and Gripping

 Brilliant Trilogy

 Perfectly political

 Can we have one of Labour now please? ;)

 Perfect Drama - Still pertinent today

 A masterpiece of suspenseful drama

 Puts a new spin on "biting political satire"....

 Much, much better than USA remake.

 Still relevany after all these years

 Recorder, recorder, who's got the recorder?
