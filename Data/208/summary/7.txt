 Well made but the story just didn't grab me

 It's well made but it won't be on any of my top-lists.

 Luckily Truffaut didn't stop with `The Four Hundred Blows"

 Good movie, but hardly brilliant or a classic

 Wild Child

 good but not great

 The "Liberté, égalité, fraternité, ou la mort" is here the "Negligence, companionship, liveliness, or the collapse"

 Magnificent movie...

 One of the Best among All-Time Coming-of-Age Films

 "Nothing that boy does surprises me."

 Not bad at all, but a little bit disappointed.

 Critique: "The 400 Blows"

 Good

 Very good but familiar
