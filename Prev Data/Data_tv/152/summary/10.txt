 Welcome to the Pantheon, Louis C.K.

 An Everyman's Misanthrope

 The most bizarrely refreshing show on TV today

 Louie, please save comedy for us!

 Started Slow But Faith in Louie

 Disturbingly refreshing

 One of today's best comic's raises the bar for all future situation comedies

 Excellently different

 Louis CK is at a new level

 Probably the ultimate legacy of Louis C.K.

 Comedic mastermind

 Wow. This is probably THE worst show I've ever seen in my entire life!

 Far and away the funniest TV show I've ever seen

 the best

 Louie, you miserable f***!

 Keeping It Real

 Louis is one of the most honest and creative works to grace television.

 Thought-provoking comedy at its best

 What a gem

 This is how you make TV!

 Dark, hilarious, and oddly heartwarming.

 Incredibly realistic, simple, and both funny and melancholic

 Disturbingly funny for all the wrong reasons

 Greatest show that makes me feel deep connections like "Friends" show.

 Brilliant show,don't read negative reviews,read this.
