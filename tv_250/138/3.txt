Well, clearly I am in the minority here...But if this mini series was designed to show the dullness and blandness of war, then it certainly did that well. And ended up being dull and boring to watch! You could argue that war is like that, however one particular episode when marines are coming under sustained fire from no less than 3 directions, while being cornered on a bridge - and yet the only wound *any* of them receive is a scratch - well, that just tests credibility too much. Naturally, the death toll amongst from the attackers was massive.Realistic? Apart from that, almost the only other action in the whole series is a convoy of Humvee's shooting up some Iraqi shopkeepers in a small village and hollering like rednecks.After watching a few episodes, I was rooting for the Iraqi militia.
