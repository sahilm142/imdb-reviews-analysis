 Great Beginning, Great End, Dull Middle

 The great group Monty Python stands out in this often uproariously fun and hilarious classic movie

 I know I am the minority.... I am very disappointed

 High rating should come with a warning label

 Still one of the best comedies of all time

 A very good and funny spoof of medieval movies that has its flaws

 A mockery of Arthurian legand!

 Should have been the start of something bigger...

 The holy grail of non-sense comedy!

 Ni.

 Makes Ben Hur look like an Epic

 Very silly romp

 Monty Python at their most irreverent

 What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?...

 An Old Classic Nonsense Roasting Old Myths in a Very Hilarious Way.

 beware of the German translation

 The Pre-Cursor to The Life Of Brian

 Hilarious Monty Python comedy...

 excellent to watch once..

 The Holy Grail

 "What, behind the rabbit?"

 Sublime silliness

 It stands the test of time.

 So funny, it hurts
