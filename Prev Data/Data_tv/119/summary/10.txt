 But only from Season 1-10. Season 11-0!

 Blew the mind of an uninitiated, long time sci-fi lover

 Time passes by so quickly.

 Love the New Dr. Who!

 One of the greatest television programs of all time

 Invincible, imaginative, inspiring

 Doctor Who works better as a 50-year-old franchise, rather than just choosing one episode!

 A Great Ride for Both Kids and Adults

 Easily one of the best shows ever produced

 A late discovery

 I give it a 10 for all the other seasons, except for the 11th season.

 "Do You Wanna Come With Me?!"

 The best sci fi on TV

 You can't argue with success

 How Doctor Who became the best show on TV

 Start watching on season 1, 3 or 11

 Hard not to like

 How I got hooked

 Great return of the Doctor, one of the best programs to come out of Britain for a long time

 One of the best series of all times

 slow and steady wins the race!

 This show is both "Fantastic" and "Brilliant"

 Who's the Best on Television? The Doctor!!!

 10 for the series, 1 for current season

 Clever writing and brilliant acting makes New Who outstanding
