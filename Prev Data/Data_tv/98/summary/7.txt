 Worth watching but don't expect too much from it...

 Don't be deceived by the unreasonably high rating.

 Good show, pity the pace is so slow

 Disappointed with S02

 Killing = Bad

 Good, with one flaw

 Went from very good to mediocre

 Intriguing but erratic

 It's pretty good but....

 A fair review

 Season 1: Good action, but let's admit the plot is a bit boring

 Boredom

 Good but not great

 7. Most overrated show on TV. Needs work.

 Decent, could be better

 Bad season 2...

 Why?

 Show has promise after season 1 but has flaws

 Very weak start but its starting to show promise

 Better than average but nothing to Marvel at...

 Love the show but

 Season 3

 Mindblowing first season, mediocre follow-thru

 Great so far, hoping for better

 Starts with real class, and then poops out
