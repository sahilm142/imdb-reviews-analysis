 Frodo Row Your Boat Ashore

 One of the best fantasy films of the new millenium

 Very high production values, very long, perfect for "Ring" fans.

 It grew on me

 A short review for a very long film.

 Tolkien would be proud...

 Good, but too much unnecessary stuff added to the story

 Technically brilliant movie

 THE BEGINING OF A GREAT STORY

 A Precious Beginning

 An Amazing Start to Middle Earth Saga

 Good story that won't confuse. Well done and appealing to anyone seeking fantasy and action.

 Sauron opened his eye

 Great, but not perfect movie

 A Terrific adaptation of perhaps the greatest fantasy of the twentieth century

 A worthy beginning to a legend

 My personal favorite of the trilogy

 as good as you'd expect

 My Childhood Dream

 The second one is 4 hours long......Kill me.

 There and back again

 Unrepeatable

 10Words - The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

 2001.. really!!! I can't believe it!

 Very Good
