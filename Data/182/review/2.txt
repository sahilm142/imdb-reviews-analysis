An emotionally unstable country man struggles with the choice between his mistress from the city and his innocent country family.The main problem I had with this film is that it's unintentionally funny when it's trying not to be and unintentionally disturbing when it's trying to be cute or funny. I can actually imagine people acting the way the characters in this film do, but that doesn't mean it's worth putting into a movie. This is a bit of a spoiler, but having a character who almost murdered his wife chase her up a hill yelling "Don't be afraid of me!" is more ironically funny than it is pathos invoking. The early use of a semi-synch soundtrack is interesting and the lantern scene near the end is pretty, but it's not worth the suffering you'll endure if you dislike poorly written/directed films. In short, this movie set the precedent for Oscar winners being the worst movies made each year.I'd recommended this for people who like Citizen Kane for its heavy handed writing and self- indulgent directing/mise-en-scene.Content Notes: It's super cheesy, but the male lead is pretty violent and loony (e.g., his propensity for trying to kill women) so use your own judgment when it comes to young viewers.
