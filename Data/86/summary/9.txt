 A miracle of a film! The true definition of an epic

 Expensive and breathtaking screen adaptation of enigmatic adventurer and military T. E. Lawrence

 He likes your lemonade.

 Yes, it is a very long movie, but the DVD on a large screen HDTV is worth it!

 A masterpiece

 Not Really an Epic !!!

 A Complex Man In Epic Events

 Classic, Epic Fillmmaking

 Freedom from the shackles of "civilization"

 Lawrence of Arabia

 Epic but....

 " Nothing Changed at Dara, . . He was The Same Man! "

 Did Jesus overact?

 "Every shot, every scene is so beautifully formulated."
