 Sons of Anarchy Review (Season 1 - 3): "I'm an okay mechanic with a GED. The only thing I do well is outlaw."

 biblical, shakespearian, foreboding shades of the Trump era (watched on hulu)

 Raw, Smart, Unpredictable ... UNDENIABLY EXCELLENT!

 Something too much

 awesome

 With a focus on family, not fireworks, Sons wins out

 Addicitve and emotionally charged
