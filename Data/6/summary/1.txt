 boring and contrived

 Representation misused

 This goes beyond being just a bad film.

 No more than a useful public service announcement...

 My list

 Over-hyped and not over quick enough

 Black and White

 Holocaust as Family Drama, Awful Junk

 awfull

 one of the most overrated movies

 Oskar's humanitarianism gone for nought

 An upbeat holocaust movie?

 Black and white

 Overated and weak retelling of a tired theme...

 it had some high points but not enough to save it.

 Not All That

 I'm sorry, but it's awful

 spielberg is a MOVIE maker NOT a filmmaker

 Schmaltzy

 A slap in the face!!!!

 A fundamentally dishonest movie

 Doesn't stand the test of time

 Terrible flick *(out of 100)

 As subtle as a sledgehammer.

 What is wrong with you people?
