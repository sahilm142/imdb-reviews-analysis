 terrible bad story

 Not as good as it could have been

 A whole hour too long!

 An 8 point freaking 2 out of 10 rating for this lame movie? Really?

 Unnecessarily long and drawn out

 Had potential, but was unsatisfying

 Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball Script

 Prisoners not worth it

 Dumb

 Includes all the great qualities of a crime-thriller, but is dragged by too many irrationalities

 Disappointing

 Terrible

 Disappointment

 Too superficial; Inconsistent characters.

 Good storyline, not so interesting to watch

 Quoting Lorelai Gilmore after watching Magnolia: "I want my life back!"

 an boring film nominated to an Oscar trophy

 nice but i can read the endoctrination

 Absolutely over rated movie

 Don't Get ...?

 great acting but a clumsy and silly script

 Great Disappointment

 Extremely promising, great potential BUT ultimately very disappointing and unbelievable.
