 Delightful

 This show is surprisingly awesome!

 The Best US TV Satire In History

 Colbert Report

 already looking forward to many more episodes

 Brilliant!

 Thank the heavens for Colbert ...

 Damn Funny

 Every bit as good as "The Daily Show"

 Funny

 too close for me...

 One of Comedy Central's Best Shows!!!

 Not Everybody's Cup of Tea but I love it!

 Asolutely Hilarious!!

 Consistently Annoying and Unwatchable

 Colbert for President

 Colbert: Unfunny, smug, useless, hateful

 Problem with satirizing obnoxious people.....

 Picking up where "Daily Show" has faltered, Stephen Colbert brings an invigorating full-length, straight-faced satire of the news media back to Comedy Central

 Steven Colbert premieres in a new late night complement to The Daily Show

 As television political satire goes, his mark is indelible.

 Bring back this show

 Great, Miss It

 The new episodes are much better than the first one! It's hilarious now, exactly as I had expected it to be from the beginning.

 Especially after what Stephen Colbert said in the White House...
