Never seen a more entertaining gangster film than this one. It elicits belly-laughs with its black humor. Guy Ritchie lures us deep into an intricate world, a world only belonging to streetwise charmers, merciless debt collectors, dope drug dealers, paranoid marijuana growers, eccentric Afros and inept burglars. In this criminal subculture, they cheat and rob each other. Such a film as it is, if shot by a less intelligent, would be a disaster. But Guy makes the story full of twists and coincidences and weaves them all into his well-craft web. Elements like guns, knives, corpses and claret are indispensable parts for a gang film. In Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, guns are replaced by air rifles and antic shotguns, knives by kitchen ones and some kicking. And the bullets fly and corpses aren't that bloody since most are off-screen. And I couldn't help laughing at Soap's theory like " guns for show, knives for pro" especially when he soapboxes it with a seriousness on his soft-soap face. The dialog is recommendable and quotable. The shooting angles, especially close-ups cannot be more suitable for this films. See a label sticker under the sole of Harry? To crown them all, the cliffhanger ending is peerless.


                
I will be honest, I turned on 'Lock, Stock' with very little hope - I had been led to believe that it was a senseless action movie, the type of film that FHM give 10/10, and the rest of the world wouldn't touch with a barge pole. I was pleasantly surprised upon viewing the film, but still could not see how people compare the film to the Pulp Fictions and Trainspottings of this world.Upon reading the comments on 'Snatch', which I am yet to see, I noticed someone saying that the performances on both films were excellent across the board. Not having seen 'Snatch' I am unable to judge that, but i can certainly say that I was disappointed with the acting in 'Lock, Stock'. I felt that while Vinnie Jones made a good debut, and there was the odd good performance, the main quartet certainly let the film down. At times the focus on reeling off snappy dialogue took precedence over actually acting, and to a certain extent this led me to stop actually caring about what happened to the characters. While the thrill of their audacious attempts was great, and some of the lines were hilarious, most viewers get too swept up to really care at all about the characters. Some will say that this doesn't matter, but it certainly does to me.Ritchie's style of direction at times baffled me - at times I saw glimpses of cinematic genius, and realised exactly what the 'music video style' could bring to film, (e.g. Eddie's departure from the poker game) but occasionally shots felt amateurish and lazy - for example look at the two Kennys' 'get the guns' argument near the end of the film. This meant i could occasionally see what the plaudits were on about, and occasionally jumped right back to my original feelings about the film.There is normally nothing that I hate more than pretentious film critics rubbishing a film because it isn't a) a postmodern satire on what it is really like to be a man or b) a documentary on Ukrainian house-husbands, and I did thoroughly enjoy Lock, Stock (I gave it 7/10). However, it is not, in my opinion, worthy of top 250 entry, and will always remain for me a post-pub fun fest.


                
A complex, ultra-black comedy packed with violence and profanity, this is one of the best films to come out of Britain in recent years. Ignore the seriousness of other thrillers like FACE, and instead concentrate on the hilarious dialogue and fun characters which this film is full of. From 'Hatchet Harry' to 'Barry the Baptist', this film has an endless parade of clichéd villains who are an absolute delight to watch, not least Vinnie Jones' hard debt collector who enjoys slamming people's heads in a variety of doors.There's an obvious influence here from Tarantino's work, but the two directorial styles are very different. Director Guy Ritchie has some weird, trippy moments in this film, to counteract the smoothness of other scenes. The comedy comes from the increasingly confused situation in the film, and is consistently funny. The acting is all pretty good, with top marks going to Dexter Fletcher ("Guns for show, knives for a pro"). The violence is frequent but never done in a serious matter; there are loads of shoot-outs and bodies everywhere, but they're not to be taken seriously. Basically, this film is perfectly done and one of the liveliest London gangster films ever made. See it!
Bacon (Jason Statham), Eddy (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) are lifelong friends. Eddy is the card player. Bacon, and Tom are hustlers. Soap is straight and legal. They pull together the money to go into Harry 'The Hatchet' big card game. Harry rigs the game and the guys are down £400,000. Harry gives them a week before his muscle Barry the Baptist takes care of them. They decide to rob their drug dealing neighbor. Meanwhile Barry is looking to steal a priceless antique shotgun but it ends up in the hands of the four friends.This is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino and that's not a bad thing. This is Guy Ritchie's full length feature debut. It shows that he has skills but it's not quite as polished as 'Reservoir Dogs'. The accents are quite thick. The comedy doesn't always translate well. However Ritchie has got the style down. This also introduced Jason Statham to the movie world.


                
This is a well-written, well-acted and beautifully shot gangster movie in which Vinnie Jones is as good as everyone says (though playing a menacing thug was not perhaps the greatest test of his acting abilities). However, like most of the other films which constitute the `renaissance' of British cinema (e.g. The Full Monty) this is a thoroughly enjoyable, but ultimately lightweight offering.The plot revolves around a number of caricatures; we have the ruthless gangland boss (into collecting expensive guns and beating people to death with dildos), the `soft' marijuana-growing public-school boys and a couple of thieving Scousers who would probably be more at home in a Harry Enfield sketch than in the East End, while the heroes are essentially the bunch of bumbling amateur criminals so beloved of the British psyche. Despite the inevitable comparisons to Reservoir Dogs et al, this is a very British film which in general rejects the slick wit of Tarantino to play on its caricatured characters with a mixture of understatement, sarcasm and dark cockney humour, with the occasional slice of slap-stick comedy thrown in for good measure. The plot twists and turns engagingly backed by an excellent soundtrack, and the ending is a relief from standard Hollywood predictability. However,  I was surprised to find that a lot of the much-touted violence was more comic than genuinely unnerving which was perhaps a shame <U+0096> sustaining a more chilling atmosphere to contrast with the laughs would have contributed some depth to this film.Do go and see Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels- it is fun and well worth the entrance money. But it is as likely to change your perspective on life as Lethal Weapon 4.


                
I'm no Guy Ritchie supporter or anything and therefor in reviewing this film I remain more objective than some might be. This here is a heavily English action-comedy, I emphasize its country of origin as some might be too foreign to its cultural tinge and should be mindful of that during its viewing. Slang, talking speed, the attitudes overall...it's definitely different, and this film wasn't made to be a polished flavorless ready-to-sell-internationally item. It's authentic, rough in places but never too much and showcases an effortless (and surprising ?) balance of humor and comedy, along with hard-hitting, raw action. Its main plot is uber simple, but that's totally fine. In fact, it makes it better. Because now the movie has its trigger and the movie-makers can focus on all the rest: the little subplots, the humor, involving other characters and parties to the core of the story, before unleashing an ultimate climax at the end that is, again, very simple, almost too simple; and yet, at the risk of sounding over-complacent, it works - fits that story and mood perfectly. No reason film shouldn't be this way from time to time. Yeah it's simple, but it's effective, lots of fun, runs so smoothly and where it isn't deep and what not, it's highly entertaining, and you can't just make 'highly entertaining' if you don't know movie making.


                
Ritchie uses almost every known British character actor/soap star for his gang romp revolving around the simple premise of some guys owing a gang boss a large amount of money. The cast is impressive you gotta admit, of course you gotta be British to probably get the most from it, but the collection of oddballs and gangsters are all so well performed by the cast, it just shoves the seedy, gritty, dirty Del boy London grim in your face perfectly.There is certainly a Tarantino style going on throughout as the story tends to twist n turn amongst all the dreary looking locations, the whole film seems to have a brownish tint to it. Almost an enforced grimy hue to really bring the rough dilapidated streets of London to life. To be honest you don't even need to follow the story you just watch it for the continuous use of cockney slang and hints of vicious violence between various ruffians (a case of less is more with the violence), at the same time all this is accompanied by a glorious soundtrack.A slick cool visage of thugs and wheeler dealers of varying levels of intelligence all mixed with a dark gallows humour that makes you unsure whether to giggle or shy away. The four main characters are a good balance of your classic 'EastEnders' types with a dollop of 'Only Fools n Horses' comedy on top in a world where the Kray brothers could still be walking the streets and where Vinnie Jones as Big Chris brings another level of atmosphere with his final act. Bosh! job done Guv'7/10
I watched Snatch way before I watch this one. So the movie is really predictable to me. And with Snatch as my standard for a Guy Ritchie movie, it really isn't any disappointment to see this movie turn out to be beneath the former in terms of overall watching satisfaction. The movie is indeed one that shaped a general image of a Guy Ritchie movie, a greatly funny and ironic crime movie, a heist movie in sub genre. Though the movie being ironic an funny is more or less predictable for me, I was still curious about how the story will unfold. Also the quirky and shady characters developed are the things that add much curiosity to the movie. The acting overall is a great job for me, especially in how the performances feel so natural because they are done by natives. It's quite bad that not all the alumni of this movie's cast made it into bigger stages and careers.
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" has that kinetic style that comes from making music videos - but it's not nearly as empty as that sounds, what with all of the sub-plots going on here. This is a dingy underworld populated with a wide array of colorful characters - all sleazy, but thoroughly entertaining, be they nasty muscle men or rank amateurs. And it's a movie that rife with personality; great lines, a soundtrack mixing '70s soul with '90s rock, and even the violence has a sense of humor. And then, outta nowhere, there's Sting as a disapproving bartender.It's a gas.7/10


                
This is the One that Launched the Careers of a One Trick Pony Director, Guy Ritchie, and Actors Jason Statham, and Vinnie Jones. So now You Know what to Blame it All on. Ritchie has Continued to Remake this Movie, Again and Again, in His Now Long and Mediocre Career, and Why Not? It's Influence has been Phenomenal and that in Itself is Phenomenal since this was a Movie Influenced (being polite) by what had Come Before, Mainly Tarantino, Scorsese, but Other Movies to be Sure.The Overrated Director has an Annoying Trait (actually more than one) of Repeating Himself, not just in Other Films, but Within Each Film. For Example, the Overexposed, High Contrast, Gold and Yellow Sepia-Tone Sheen Look (from filming with 16mm) is Cool for about a Scene or Two, but the Director Decides to Film Virtually the Whole Movie in this Glaring Style. Another Example, while the First Half of the Film Uses many Recognizable Pop Tunes (are you getting deja vu) but Once Iggy Pop's "I Wanna be Your Dog" is heard, the Guitar Riff Plays Over and Over Again for the Remainder.The Film has Some Fun with the Complications of the Plot as it Folds in on Itself (deja vu "again"), and there in an Energy here that is Infectious. But the Accents are Thick and may be Hard to Follow, like the Story, so some of the Jokes Might Get Lost in Translation and Add to that, it is Wrapped in a lot of British Slang.Enormously Popular and Highly Overrated, this is One of those that Should be Watched at Least Once just to See what All the Fuss is About, and Once You've Seen it, You Never have to Watch Another Guy Ritchie Movie. Unless You like the Feeling of Deja Vu.


                
LOCK,STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS is an amusing and adroitly handled comedy thriller,but with the benefit of hindsight not particularly memorable or profound,and it's considerable success has led to many other British filmmakers like Guy Ritchie himself to churn out innumerable,and eventually,resistible derivative 'mockney' gangster dramas.At least LOCK,STOCK has the advantage of not taking itself seriously,with the advantages of a clever plot,a decent ensemble cast and satisfying script.So LOCK,STOCK is in fact very enjoyable,but not without faults.One is the overtly jokey,"guns n' geezers" theme that is an obvious imitation of the style that Quentin Tarantino carried off so successfully in his first two films (RESERVOIR DOGS,PULP FICTION);Ritchie is not as subtle,electing to indulge in some shoot-em-up action that often comes across as knockabout slapstick,and the toughest gangsters on show here considerably lack both the terrifying menace and scatological wit that QT achieved with such style.There is also the undeniable feeling that Ritchie seems overwhelmingly pleased with his own directorial bravado,with it's various visual flourishes and narrative tricks,which superficially entertain but seem rather shallow and pointless soon afterwards.And Vinny Jones' much vaunted appearance is not so much acting as a continuation of his Wimbledon FC 'Crazy Gang' persona,with it's manufactured,exaggerated machismo.Mr.Jones abilities as a actor are identical to those he had as a footballer: fairly effective,but in a crude,heavy-handed manner.But like his soccer career,Jones has managed considerable and unexpected success as a big-screen performer,despite critical apathy and adulation that is rather out of shape and proportion to his aptitude as a thespian.LOCK,STOCK is still fine entertainment despite these concerns,though Ritchie since has become increasingly carried away with his follow-ups;SNATCH had it's merits but was even more bloatedly self-indulgent and ostentatious,and SWEPT AWAY and REVOLVER were considerable box-office and critical mishaps.Ritchie can direct alright,but with more humility and less attempts at flagrant exhibitionism he may be more appreciated and respected universally. I hope my doubts about him can be dislodged one day;his chances are running out.RATING:7 out of 10.
It's funny movie but not bad, this movie show the best lucky man ever, maybe the gangsters not gangsta maybe they just lucky.


                
Bloody good, bloody fun.. Cockney crime caper classic!


                
I can totally see why this film has such a great reputation. It's quick-on-its-feet (well, once the first forty minutes or so have passed), violent and also doesn't take itself too seriously. in fact, I'd say this is as much of a comedy as it is a crime drama. The situations the characters get themselves in are pretty absurd, and the whole thing hinges on coincidence and a kind of wild spiralling-out-of-control-of-circumstance taht, although a bit unbelievable, just works for telling this kind of story. What's more, the script is witty as hell and absolutely bursting with great one-liners and scathing put-downs. I found the cadence of the dialogue to be almost lulling, and all the actors delivered their lines with convictiona nd clarity that I find lacking in some of the US films of similar type. Nevertheless, I think fans of the Breaking Bad TV series might enjoy this, as I found some of the elements to be similar, and, as in taht series, at times I felt like I was watching an episode of The Three Stooges instead of a serious crime flick. That's not meant to be a slag against BB or this movie, but just a reflection of just how absurd these things can get.And really, I think the absurdity is rather welcome. Crime movies can be such dreary affairs nowadays; I think the levity is appreciated. Also, no police characters, just a bunch of hoods and old-timer crooks with names like "Soap", "Bacon", "Barry the baptist" and "Dog". I can't think of a bad performance here and even Sting, of all people, has a small role and doesn't let the side down (god, I'll never forget him in Dune!).The music is all extremely well-chosen rock and soul tunes, too, and I dug all of it, especially the james Brown and Stooges. The whole film feels very honest and sincere despite its general silliness, and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I also love the ambiguous ending and am glad taht noone has yet interpreted it as an open interpretation to "hey, let's make a sequel!" Good work, fellas.


                
Ritchie's feature film debut and very similar in themes and outlook to his next film, Snatch. A film about dubious criminals, simple souls, odd happenstances, bloody brutality and tongue-in-cheek crime comedy.The story goes that a group of four friends end up owing money to the biggest, meanest and baddest crime lord in town. To solve this conundrum they decide to rob their next door neighbours, who just happen to be gangsters planning a big heist against a local bunch of weed cultivators. There's also a pair of antique shotguns floating around. Hence the name.Ritchie's signature flair shines through even this early on. The film is full of inventive camera angles, nonchalant character reactions and certain attitude that to me resembles an odd mixture of pro wrestling and 40s pulp adventure. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is a Character with a capital C. Everyone is playing a role, everyone is posturing, yet everyone is at least a bit clueless and oddly sincere in their interactions. It's at the same time ridiculous and utterly endearing.Still, compared to Snatch, this is a lesser film. The plot is nowhere near as snappy, the cinematography doesn't have the reproductive organs to go all the way and for some reason the whole film uses this awful brown filter, which makes the film look like it crawled through the London sewer system.Is it worth a watch? Absolutely! It's just that Snatch pulls it off even better. Watch both if you can, but if you can only watch one, this is not the one.


                
Yes this is a good film, yes it shows Britain can make good films but this isn't the best film of 1998, nor is this the best Britian can produce.  The problem with "LS&2SB" is it is trying to be a British Tarantino-lite and it doesn't really work that well.I enjoyed the film, but the film lacked a good and strong ending, and the swearing was too much.


                
Despite the blood and language this is not a particularly violet film, it does have moments of tension filled humour and a gritty realism that has been taken up by several other films. Long Good Friday and Way of the Gun fans should like this one.


                
It's funny, it's innovative (the movie stills and slow motions, the camera angles, etc.), and certainly smart plots! Treat yourself by watching this British movie. Very imaginative, and uses many approach hardly seen in American Movie.Even the casts are unpredictable. It started like Two Days in a Valley, but later the story take a steer twist which interacts all the casts. Very interesting and inspirational indeed, especially from the conceptual story and artwork. For new movie freak and serious appreciator.


                
A good film which is very stylish, taking ideas used in other films like 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', and 'Mean Streets'.  Therefore on that level of originality it is not that original.BUT the characters and the settings and the crazy story line is totally original and I applaud it greatly.  Sometimes I think the movie tried to hard to be off kilter (one to many surprises and jumps), but it is still enjoyable and totaly English!This movie confirms my suspicions of what I always felt. 
Vinnie Jones is a total goon.Rating 7 out of 10.


                
I liked Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. But when compared to Snatch... it's not that great. I thought that Snatch was hilarious. Smoking Barrels has laughs, but it's not as funny as Snatcxh or as good. I can't really tell you the plot. Because I had a hard time following this film. Like with Ritchie's Rocknrolla. I found this film a little boring at times too, but really I can't blame the film for that. This movie is definitely not as good as Snatch. But Guy Ritchie was young at the time. Lock, stock, and two smoking barrels is a good film though. I don't think it should be on the top 250, but it's still a good movie. Thumbs up.Lock,stock,and two smoking barrels:***/****
STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A member of a small group of cockney wide-boys loses in a poker game and finds himself in debt to a feared local mob boss. Desperate to keep his fingers, him and his friends agree to rob a gang that are about to rob a gang of local drug dealers. But no one's going quietly- and things threaten to turn nasty.As well as Ritchie (behind the camera) the film also made fairly big names out of it's main stars, Jason Statham, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran and Jason Fleming, not to mention the acting debut of notorious soccer hardman Vinnie "it's been emotional" Jones.We're certainly not talking about a bad film, here, a film that definitely got some big names rocking and rolling and understandably so. But the plot doesn't flow as smoothly here and it's filmed through-out in a really dinghy use of the camera that didn't appeal. Not to mention an ending that feels like it's dragging on somewhat.A good film, then, very stylish and quite clever, but Ritchie was to make a more digestible and enjoyable film a few years later with Snatch. Just my opinion, of course. ***


                
A wonderful blend of sharp witty humor, plenty of twists that are sure to leave you trying to keep up (and even pausing the movie for a couple of moments just to make sure you actually are up to speed on the whole plot), and of course Guy Ritchie's undeniable style that will capture and enthrall your attention, which always gives his films such a unique feel to them only adding to the overall enjoyment. Oh and some violence thrown in for good measure (what's a good gangster film without violence?). the actors did a convincing job for not being very well known in fact they did a much better job than most of the actors you see in modern films these days. And the story was absolutely hilarious! Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a heist film involving four friends owing a grand some of half a million pounds to a local gangster after he rigs a card game. And now they have only one week to come up with the money or else... and so begins the start of many schemes and brilliant twists that make up this film and only add to the dark hilarity proving it very difficult not to laugh. Even though the humor is much more darker than your average flick (but really is that a bad thing) Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a great Guy Ritchie film and a brilliant debut showcasing his skills in directing a very enjoyable film. Although it might not be quite as good as Snatch (though Brad Pitt was a huge disappointment) but definitely a favorite of mine even if the accents can be hard to understand. Well worth the rent if you've never seen it before I highly recommend it.


                
This film must show Americans that not all the English speak with posh accents and act in pretentious ways. Whenever I watch an American sitcom or film portraying someone British I find myself on my high horse as hardly anyone speaks in the way they think we do. If we give all Americans this film to watch they will soon realise that England isn't as pretty in pink as they seem to believe. This film is gritty, dark, humorous and filled with all kinds of cockney rhyming slang that Americans would need subtitles. This is the London they all fail to see. The film is about four friends, one of whom Eddy (Moran) is a brilliant card player due to his ability to read people's emotions during a game of cards. Being onto what they believe as a winning deal, the group all pitch in twenty five thousand pound for him to use in an underground card game. Little do they know however that Hatchet Harry, the organiser of the game, doesn't believe in a fair game and cheats his way to taking all Eddy's money and incurring him a five hundred thousand pound debt on top of that. The debt also includes his friends who will all start losing their fingers if they don't repay in seven days. The friends have no idea where to start but manage to overhear their drug dealing neighbours discussing their plan to steal a large amount of money from some incompetent drug dealers. Eddy's plan is to rob these guys once they have robbed the other guys. Meanwhile two antique shotguns have just been priced at three hundred thousand pounds and Hatchet Harry sends two scouse lads in to steal them. Miscommunication construes and Eddy and the gang end up with five hundred thousand pounds worth of cash and two antique shotguns. Breathing down their neck are also the neighbours, the incompetent drug dealers and their dangerous boss, Hatchet Harry and his cronies and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) who 'collects' for Harry. The film plays out with lots of interweaving plot lines and several twists and turns all filled with irony. Each twist and turn ends up with someone not realising just what they have a hold of. For example the group find themselves in possessions of the guns which would solve all their problems but they have no idea that these guns are actually of some value. Also the two scouse lads tracking down the guns don't realise they are actually hunting down the person they robbed them for in the first place. The plot is completely confusing and will make no sense in writing but to watch it you will see exactly what I mean.The script is fantastic, all the dialogue is realistic and well thought out and the majority of the acting is spot on, especially from Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham. The opening five minutes set it all up with an Only Fools and Horses style selling technique. Bacon (Statham) is attempting to flog some dodgy jewellery before being chased by the police. The dialogue and acting in this sequence sets us up for the acts to follow and really creates the world that we will be living in for the next two hours. Bravo Mr Ritchie a compelling script you have bought to our attention. One scene that is brilliant is when the neighbours are locked in a cage during the robbery and are being shot at with an air rifle. The whole sequence is fantastic.However the film does have its downfalls. At times there are just too many characters and people are introduced and then disappear for long periods before returning and others show up so late you wander why they were bothered with in the first place. In the end it does all come together but throughout the overuse of characters sometimes makes the plot seem a little disjointed.I personally think this is a very good film but it has to be your cup of tea otherwise you won't enjoy it. It is one of Guy Ritchie's best films but certainly not his best, Snatch gets that award hands down. I believe that if I was reviewing this film in 1998 then I would be more impressed but as I am viewing it after I've seen Snatch particularly, I can't rate it quite as highly. It is a good film but I suggest you watch it before Snatch. That way you will be treated to a very good film followed by a great one.


                
Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is too mixed-up to synopsise easily and too rickety to think about closely, but it gets plenty of laughs as it rushes from scene to scene. The story is about a heist involving a self-confident young card sharp who loses £500,000 to a powerful crime lord in a rigged game of three card brag. In order to pay off his debts, he and his friends decide to rob a small-time gang who happen to be operating out of the flat next door.This crime caper has not a great deal of originality or heart, but displays an undeniable energy as its cast of memorable faces duck and dive between narrative entanglements. Unhappily, its massive success opened the floodgates to a wave of dismal British gangster movies. A television series, Lock, Stock..., followed in 2000.
