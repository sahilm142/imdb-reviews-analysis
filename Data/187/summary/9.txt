 Disquieting great film

 Stunningly well told story.

 Whatever side of the divide you may sit...

 I really enjoyed it

 powerful and touching

 Contumacy and solidarity

 Excellent

 A very powerful film

 Another stunner about survival of the spirit

 That was a good day's work.

 a son, a father, and the damning of the Irish (or any damned group)

 More proof that Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time

 Jim Sheridan's Finest Feature. One of Daniel Day-Lewis' Finest Performances.

 In the Name of Respect, Dignity and Truth ...

 Very sad and powerful film

 was a very good story, represented

 Great performances, powerful movie.

 Gripping, stunning and very moving story of innocent people wrongly imprisoned and a moving father and son story a must see.

 Brilliant commentary that is 100% relevant today

 Touches the Heart. A great, great film

 Never Abandon the Fight to Clear Your Name

 Resonates today

 A Superb Piece of Hollywood

 a must see film........still.
