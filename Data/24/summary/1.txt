 It's A Nauseating Life

 It could only happen in America

 It's a wonderful reason to jump off a bridge

 Over-rated sentimental tosh!

 Perhaps slightly overrated? *spoilers*

 Puerile nonsense

 slush

 Dated. Terrible acting, writing, directing etc.

 Where to begin? (Mildly spoilerish)

 Review (pan!) Pls publish this, for an alternate "take".

 I've always hated it, and I always will.

 Too Depressing

 It's a Blunderful Life

 Too much sediment

 horrible

 awful

 Bad film

 why its not a classic to me

 Life of a communist
