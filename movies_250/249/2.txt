when it started ,, i was hooked and it kept me hooked till the story of shahid khan was going on,, the moment this chapter ended and sardar khan (son of shahid) grows up to seek revenge from Ramadhir singh for his fathers murder ,, the narration went haywire ...till the end of the film , the main plot of the film "the revenge" of sardar khan was missing ,, what did he do to ramadhir singh??? ,, how he managed or even tried to destroy him??? ,, was not there at all,, forget about it being unclear,,do you want me to believe that he avenged him by just slapping his son in front of a magistrate for which he was send to jail,, or just warning him by making a person dance on street on mithun's song,,,, sorry but there was no serious damage done to ramadhir singh,, or his image,, rather he(sardar khan) was quite happy flirting and making love to a woman he finds in wasseypur,, whether he wants to avenge ramadhir first or want to destroy Qureshi's first in wasseypur??? and if both then he must have worked twice as hard as he worked for it,,,,,,shahid khan kept volleying between two wives and trying to find a correct method to make guns and bombs,, all of this was funny to a point ,, but after a point it was just repeating itself and the hero and the plot were lost in all of this fun making ,,, and the film is not about a man who lost his way due to his own indulgence,, negligence and merry makingIts OK if this man wants to have fun ,, (surely he did and only did fun) ,, but what does he do the next morning ,, does he have a plan of action , does he has fire in his belly to avenge his father's murder??Mr. Anurag Kashyap..."Good fellas" also had a lot of fun ,, but they also worked towards making money and keeping power,, one scene for each layering is enough,, to show that the gangster has a keep and visits brothels and is having a crisis at home with wife and has also indulged in coke , etc etc and shots of each plot can come and go,,, but the real tension lies in delivering goods next day at the job,, and then it is fun,,if the main characters vow is not important to him ,, why should i sit through it,, he was doing many things which were fun but all of these things were digression ,,, he himself was not committed towards his vow.... the movie has great scenes and all the performances are worth to see this movie ,, but good scenes don't make a good screenplay,,, if there are average scenes but when added together they say a clear focused story its better than good scenes back to back but going no where and not taking the story anywhereDirector chooses to titillate the audiences with colloquial nuances and banal flirtations and also some very regular but interesting abusive language,,, and all this peeping into the "interesting" ,"daredevil", ego driven lives of these ruffians, only ends up in a very unidimensional view ,, which sadly restricts itself only to titillations and smart talk,,director chooses to say same thing in 2-3 scenes and sometimes has also underlined it by shot after shot repeating it,,so many plots ,, which were unnecessary,, and if they were necessary,,, as godfather has sunny and michael and other plots,,and for to make an Indian godfather the "maker" wants to adapt each one from "Coppola's" ,, these could have been done in a more concise manner The director wants to do lot of things together at the same given point,, hangover of scorsese,, Tarantino ,, and of course the thirst to make Godfather is very evident,, but those guys don't just shoot well,, but also have a story to say,, and however crazy their characters are ,,they have a line of action.. This has been a problem with Anurag Kashyap's movies,, he takes good plots , starts interestingly but ends up making indulgent movies,,and with this one he has gone twice more indulgent,, what could have been done in a 3 hour cut he is trying to do it in two parts ,,,,
Worst movie ever seen in my life. Stupid and illogical sequence of killings, random unwanted scenes and dialogue, no specific plot other than revenge, no plan, poor direction, No relation between scenes, no humor other than keeping names as definite and perpendicular as if it evoked huge comedy. The only few memorable scenes are 'keh ke lunga', 'karne se pehle permission to leni chahiye' and 'beta tumse na ho payega' ,which are just digestible But anyways its my opinion, such movies will keep on coming and people will keep on liking it . If I'm wrong let me know why should one like it and what did we learn from it?<U+FEFF>
