 "Only when he learned he would die did he start to live!"

 The most moving and human film I have ever seen.

 a cinematic experience that's a near-nexus of existentialism- life, living, dying, death, and can be done while alive- remarkable

 Simply Brilliant - Kurosawa's Greatest

 Not just a film, but an incredible learning experience

 Kurosawa is Kafka going Kawabata...

 Coming Alive

 "I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that"

 Excellent , must see for everyone it can change your thought about life

 One of those movies you just have to see

 A masterpiece of international cinema.
