 Start of S4 not the best

 Heck of a lot better than I thought it might be!

 A step forward for televised science fiction

 The smartest thing on television

 Yes, it is different

 This isn't your daddy's BSG.

 A Fraking good show.

 Extremely addictive, but not without its imperfections

 First two seasons will easily be near the best shows you ever watch. Avoid three and four!

 Inventive story arcs, outstanding performances, and a solid moral compass.

 Good news from the Heavens for Humanity

 keeps my eyes focused on the TV

 Compelling sci fi drama

 Reimagining takes Characters in a new direction

 Emotional only word that describe it.

 Extraordinary , unusual like REAL Science Fiction supposed to be ( spoiler )

 After second watching

 Dark, compelling, human <U+0096> a gripping and excellent sci fi drama

 a good program

 this sucks

 A universe of rapidly paced drama delving into the essence of what it means to be human.

 Newly discovered gem

 I like it

 battlestar galactica S1-4

 Give it a shot
