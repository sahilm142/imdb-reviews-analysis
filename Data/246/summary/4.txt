 Over-promised and Under-Delivered

 Just another alien drama with the spice of religion

 Average or below

 A satire stretched too far - Aamir & Hirani lose their edge

 Disappointed with the movie had so much expectation from RKH

 Aamir and Raju Hirani can make better than this

 mediocre

 Definitely Overrated

 Hindu Bashing Movie

 No Big deal

 Weak Story line

 Pls read it..

 Thought of liking it but ended with disappointment
