 Changed my mind about Anime

 My favorite Anime

 Dear, Dear, anime fans who obsess over Naruto and Bleach-YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET

 Top , non-Miyazaki, Anime

 I'm not the biggest fan of anime, but I can tell you - this is an excellent series

 Utterly addictive pleasure

 A story with an ending no one I know could even guess

 The Greatest Anime Series I Have Seen

 Trade An Arm For Full Metal Alchemist If You Have To

 Well done, one of my favorite Anime.

 Without a doubt one of the best anime series ever made

 Dramatic and Impressive

 Hagane no renkinjutsushi: Hugely hit and miss

 The Godfather of anime

 One of the most impressive anime shows....ever.

 Change "free time" to "time well spent".

 One of The Greatest Anime of All Time

 Very fine anime-MY FAVORITE!

 Fullmetal Alchemist...The Best Anime Series Ever!!!...NO QUESTIONS ASKED (This Comment is noted towards the Japanese version not the English version.)

 Possibly the best Anime I have ever seen

 This cute anime has what Harry Potter lacks

 An incredible series, but not without flaws

 sad,but funny,....sentimental but loving

 Even chicks can be drawn into a love of anime from this show!

 Great Anime, Disappointing Ending
