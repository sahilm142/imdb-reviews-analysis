 Fun but nothing special

 Overrated?

 Piece of CRAP

 Here comes the Marvel picture phase II

 Fun family film

 Please !

 Entertaining most of the time but an ultimately very forgettable movie.

 Amazing....If you're 15 and have A.D.H.D

 "The Avengers" of space

 Please don't feel like you HAVE to laugh.

 Fun? Yes. But far from groundbreaking.

 An unusually Marvel-lous blend of zany humour, quirky characters and thrilling action that makes for a hugely enjoyable dose of summer entertainment

 Very fun, even funny, but...

 A refreshing and amusing take on the superhero genre.

 A.D.D. cases will love this picture

 Good Entertainment!!! Typical Marvel..

 Not the best Marvel film ever, but still a decent superhero film

 Marvel does it again !!!

 Don't expect anything more than cool special effects and awesome soundtrack

 Adds Humour To Heroism. <U+2666> 73%

 Whilst extremely fun, this one has been way over hyped

 Sci-fi, comics, heroes, action and fun... A pleasant surprise....

 Disappointing (6.5/10)

 Only popcorn good

 A fun movie, but not the hit people claim it to be.
