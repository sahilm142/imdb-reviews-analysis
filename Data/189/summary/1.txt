 Grand Waste of a Stellar Cast

 The Emperor's New Clothes

 Wes Anderson's drug dealer must be rolling in money

 Another caper for the new millennium

 what on earth was this movie?

 Does not deserve 1 star but nor does it deserve 8.4

 Over rated film

 Still not a Wes Anderson fan

 A manic pace and style over substance

 Not Funny

 Don't waste your time seeing this film!

 Almost as "brilliant" as a Kanye West video

 boring...boring...boring

 Terrible, worst movie in years

 YEE NO, I found the movie as simple "MEH"

 Boring as hell, a complete waste of time

 rotten

 A movement of the bowels

 thoroughly overrated

 The worse movie I have ever seen!

 Little Budapest Hotel

 Possibly the Worst Films i have ever watched (SPOILERS POSSIBLE)

 Charlie Chaplin in Colour

 Nothing special about this movie

 Avoid this Hotel 1/2*
