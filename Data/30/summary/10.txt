 What does "per se" mean?

 Favorite Movie of all-time (here is why)

 Leon is #47 and my #1

 Awesome movie

 This is the best movie ever!

 Manolo, one glass of milk for my friend, Léon. .. OK, Make that Two.

 I have just watched it again for the 100th time...

 Still one of the more quotable, entertaining, touching and flat out enjoyable films I've ever seen.

 What else can I add to the reviews? The music is great!

 I don't think I have ever seen a movie more than I have Léon: The Professional

 If you don't like this, we can't be friends.

 Es gibt nur eine Nationalhymne und es gibt nur einen Film!
