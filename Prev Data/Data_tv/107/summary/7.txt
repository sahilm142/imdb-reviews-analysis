 Some Dark Moments, and Saw What They Were Trying to do, BUT...

 Well.....it killed a few hours.....killed 'em stone dead.

 Earth, the Sanctuary

 Entertaining

 Takes a little getting used to, but shows promise...

 better than i expected

 A Mini Series, With So Much Packed In

 Interesting New Version

 Launch all Vipers!

 Good...

 It is possible to be faithful to the original and still like the new one.

 A gripping modern reinvention of a dubious 70's scifi

 Interesting characters, surprising plot, suspense - great scifi

 Fantastic Mini ... so far

 Better than I thought

 Not bad but more room to improve

 Fun to watch. I hope to see more.

 The right tool for the right job

 A few too many liberties....

 A zillion times better than the original series....of course, this isn't saying much!
