 Should have stopped at two seasons

 Just drags on and on and on

 Two dimensional and long-winded

 Could'nt continue...

 Promising start, but....

 If a women's study class wrote a TV show

 Boring

 Unintentionally humoruous

 Read the book

 Objective review from a female atheist

 Overblown hype with a health dose of boredom and super-unbelievably

 This show is infuriating

 Interesting premise, weak acting by Elisabeth Moss, bloated production

 Great - if you want to fall asleep

 Plato's The Republic Warned of This

 Disappointing

 An allegory for Islam?

 Great book. Great production. Overrated. Sloooowww. Becomes boring at times

 Suspension of disbelief

 Slow and Unrewarding

 About as exciting as watching a comatose person

 Political Utopia

 Don't believe the hype

 Amazing Story Sadly Sadly Tied to the Formulaic Sexualization of Adult Television

 A feminists fevered dream
