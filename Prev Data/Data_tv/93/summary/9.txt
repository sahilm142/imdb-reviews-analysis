 Second season picks up fast

 Young Justice is the follow-up to the DC-Animated-Universe we all deserved.

 One of Cartoon Network's best shows in recent years, not perfect but terrific all the same

 Gone too Soon

 Quite possibly the best superhero team ever put together

 Surprisingly good

 Best superhero cartoon after Batman. And it's closer then most would think! It's a sin it was cancelled...

 One of the best DC shows ....

 Fantastic animated series from. Dc
