STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world, but not of this world. His mind simply doesn't seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this, getting himself into constant mishaps and far out, zany situations, which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesn't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks. But he never gives up and, despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him, applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end.To look at the sorry state of modern British humour, with all it's focus of sex and general vulgarity, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was made at one time. There's nothing unsuitable going on here, just good, clean U rated humour of the type Tommy Cooper and the like made in the 50s. And I find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as I did when I was a young boy in the early 90s.Although I can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him. As others have noted, it looks like he may have a type of autism. In fact I'm so convinced about it that I really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him, I think Mr Bean could be the first famous, fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger's Syndrome.If you'd like to see some truly hilarious British humour at it's very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then this would come highly recommended. Shows like Little Britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest. Shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once, and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon. *****


                
Mr Bean was great fun, i loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious!!! The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which was also pretty funny by the way!! It's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into, this series was a classic for sure, and i still watch an episode from time to time.Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of offbeat comedy must check this out.


                
...the last time I laughed this much. It's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance. At times exasperating, at times lovable, Mr Bean is an innocent, unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate. The brilliance of this character cannot be put into words, you have to see for yourself.The show gets almost too depressing at times, like in the infamous New Year's Eve sketch, or when Bean celebrates his birthday by going alone to a restaurant, offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself, and being served a stake he doesn't quite fancy. Still, there are times when you can't help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which Bean gets himself out of trouble, like when he disposes of said stake in numerous clever-ish ways, or when he changes into swimming trunks without taking his trousers off first! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you're bound to throw fits of laughter while watching. Finally, I'd like to point out that although "Bean" is classified as a program for children, it is just as enjoyable for any grown-up with a sense of humour. Because the more "adult" jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick (yes, there is such a thing) is funny no matter what age you are, "Bean" is the truest definition of a family show. This is justly a classic and it always brightens up my day.


                
Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now DVDs. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was over for a visit and I asked him if he'd ever seen Mr. Bean? "Who?" he said. So I got out my video and showed him the one where Mr. Bean is in church and starts to nod off. My brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard. He became an instant fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how hilarious these episodes are, but the fun is in sharing them with others. I have seen so many people laugh 'til it hurts! Favorite episodes are: the visit of the Queen, the Hotel room stay, late for the Dentist appointment, the Christmas episode (a classic...plus kids love it!) and the New Year Party. Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!


                
I can understand why Rowan Atkinson doesn't make more Bean TV shows--he's probably rich as can be (based on his car collection) and the movies (which are far inferior) make a ton of money. I still wish they'd make more of these delightful shows, as they are possibly the funniest show ever made--it's THAT good.One of the reasons I enjoy Bean so much is because my daughter is deaf and we can both equally enjoy the shows, as you really don't need closed captions for it. And, importantly, this makes the show amazingly easy to export abroad. It's so amazing how the show is able to make you laugh even without the use of much language--just wacky situations and terrific pantomime by Atkinson.The bottom line is that if you don't like this show, you are either dead or have absolutely no sense of humor! I have not only watched the episodes repeatedly but have shown them to my students and they never fail to elicit tons of laughs--and the teens want to see them again and again. And who can blame them? The show is so clever and well made.


                
Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matte how many times you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch. The situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous. Its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. Some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are: 1) When Mr. Bean lodges at a hotel 2) The one where he watches the scary film 3) Mind the baby ( The diaper scene especially). In fact, all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny, including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes. the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing. 10 out of 10.


                
Okay, Mr Bean mayn't be the most sophisticated comedy series ever, and it sure is one of the funniest. I do agree there may be the occasional gag that doesn't quite work, but an overwhelming majority of them work brilliantly. Mr Bean does have minimal dialogue so a lot of the humour comes from the visual gags and slapstick. That is not a bad thing whatsoever, because it actually works wonders.The story ideas are really interesting and are always constructed really well. The photography, scenery and costumes are great to look at, and the music is delightful. Other than the gags and slapstick, it is Mr Bean himself who makes the series. Mr Bean is naive, self-centred and clueless, he can't do anything right, but we love him anyway. Rowan Atkinson is perfect at conveying these character qualities; I thought he was brilliant in Black Adder, but he was just amazing in this. His facial expressions and the situations his character gets into are simply priceless. The guest appearances are also excellent, but it is Atkinson's show all the way.Overall, a complete delight of a comedy series. It is hilarious and original, like a comedy series should be, if anything though I think it should have lasted longer. 10/10 Bethany Cox


                
Mr. Bean has shaped the face of British TV comedy. He has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit, a massive budget, a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters who you just can't forget. Some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes, they're not realistic at all and they're all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers Bean has broken on its way to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. always manage to cook up interesting new ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember when Mr. Bean drove his green Mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never gets weak - the movie wasn't as good as this, but Bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world, and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor. "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be damned - this is British comedy at its best and most original. These escapades never get old! 10/10


                
The 1990s was a great decade for British sitcom with many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUTELY FABOULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BEHAVING BADLY arriving onto TV screens for the first time.However, MR. BEAN is, hands down, the greatest sitcom of the 1990s.MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. It brings to the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson.Many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not Mr. Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability. However, I believe this debate is unnecessary because I highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider Mr. Bean in such a context.Mr. Bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others. Some of his methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show. This is where the humour derives from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way. And naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to resolve.Sometimes, we see Mr. Bean show a mean or petty streak, often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it. But no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring.Unlike most examples of British comedy in the past 30 years, MR. BEAN is simple, inoffensive, harmless U-rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy. It is for this reason why the TV series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world. It is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other TV shows will have come, gone and been forgotten.Some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet I laugh just as much at Mr. Bean's antics now as I did when I first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time.The TV series has to date spawned two spin-off movies, BEAN and MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY. As one familiar with the type of humour shown in the TV series would expect, it does not translate to success on the big screen. The two movies do little justice to the TV series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes. The greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting. In both movies, the producers take Mr. Bean out of his normal British surroundings into America (the first movie) and France (the second movie). As a result, the movie characters around Mr. Bean respond differently to his behaviour than their TV series counterparts. Both movies re-use gags from the TV series, and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time. In the second movie, Mr. Bean is shown to be behaving out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny. At various times, I found myself thinking that the character I was watching was not Mr. Bean but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the TV series. His heart just wasn't in the performance. After the second movie came out, he stated publicly that he would not play Mr. Bean again. I realise how he felt.Returning to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene. Even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies.My favourite episodes are the first three - these set the high standard that was to continue. I consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless.To summarise, MR. BEAN is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this TV series. My recommendation - watch and enjoy. But only see the movies if you consider yourself a die-hard fan after seeing the TV series.

MR BEAN: THE CHILDISH, COMEDIC GENIUS! Reviewed by Blake de Raat.Mr Bean has beans for brains in "The Curse of Mr Bean". Starring Rowan Atkinson, featuring many other women, as well as a fine gentleman, Mr Bean's childish, convulsive humour will have you rolling on the floor like a child in a tantrum. Therefore, you must see Mr Bean!Mr Bean's blunders are widely used, are effective and will bring out the cheeky child that is in us all. Your sides will split when you see Mr Bean unable to reach the payment machine and use a claw to reach it, especially as he races like a drunk driver in and out of the shopping centre. In addition, you will almost feel sorry for Mr Bean when he leaves the pool naked, bumps into good-looking girls and ends up striding backwards to avoid them. Also, Mr Bean embarrasses himself when he can't fit through the slide, which exposes him to the public. We laugh at his blunders because he acts like an immature infant in the public when he makes mistakes running into people, falling over, and putting himself out there to effectively convey silly, over-the- top, humour in the midst of developing caricature. His use of caricature, in fact, is even more well-developed and sophisticated developing from his blunders. You will never regret the moment when you see Mr Bean be "the popcorn monster" where he intentionally tries to spook his girlfriend in the cinema, building tension as deathly, gruesome music fills the atmosphere. You WILL laugh at this because you see the priceless reactions from both Mr Bean and his girlfriend as they react to a movie which does not seem scary. But to them, through Mr Bean's actions, this changes. Furthermore, the comedic genius entertains us once again by placing popcorn in his nostrils, which is utterly confusing for the fine gentlemen adjacent to him. He also cannot sniff, affecting his breathing and thus bringing forth the humour that was intended by the actor. For caricature to be most effective, Mr Bean has taken some of the most idiotic things that anyone could do, to emphasise his immaturity. Clearly, he must have gotten out on the wrong side of the bed. But nonetheless, Mr Bean develops his acting ability from the caricature and slapstick he develops in these actions. If you thought the caricature was funny, we are only getting started! Mr Bean uses his slapstick riotously to help him build tension in the mostly wordless script. In fact, when he reaches the top of the diving board, he looks like a crawling baby, looking for his mum as he looks over the edge in pain, wishing he could go home! To add to the tension, two teenaged children happily want to dive but see Mr Bean in pain, scared for his life. It was as if Mr Bean was a baby and the children were supervising adults. In doing these actions, he also walked strangely, waddling his arms side to side, hitting people as they went past whilst catching the attention of the public, to develop into this cheeky child. Once again, making us laugh is easy: Mr Bean is clearly "a child in a grown man's body" (Mr Bean) for he does senseless things which clearly evokes humour. Of course, the legendary actor himself has clearly developed his caricature, slapstick, as well as his blunders to develop into the best TV show of all time!How would you feel if you missed a glorious giggle at the end your day? Mr Bean will bring you years of endless pleasure to free you from the darkness and let Mr Bean be the light at the end of the tunnel. It is hilarious, well-acted and well-rounded. You just cannot miss out; therefore, watch Mr Bean.
When I was younger, and today, Mr. Bean is a work of genius. Three-time BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson stars as the almost silent (miming) human looking alien dropped onto Earth causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. He has tried to do an exam, put his pants on in front of blind man (he didn't know he was blind), gone to church, tried to dive at a swimming pool, made lunch on a park bench, seen a scary movie, changed in his car, had a picnic with a fly intruding, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), looked after a baby in Portsmouth, been to Room 426 of The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet contest with his Teddy, driven on top of his Mini on a new chair, and even met and knocked out the Queen. Guests included Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock from They Think It's All Over, Caroline Quentin, The Day Today's David Schneider, Richard Wilson, The Fast Show's Eryl Maynard and The Vicar of Dibley's Roger Lloyd-Pack. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Comedy (Programme or Series) and Best Light Entertainment Programme. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 on The Comedians' Comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian. Outstanding!
Personally, I think "Mr. Bean" is the greatest British TV series of all time. Ever since I watched "Mr. Bean's Vacation", I have been a devoted fan of Mr. Bean. Every time Mr. Bean would either shove food in his mouth, have a mishap at the church, reenact a wacky Nativity scene, or throw a piece of steak tartar down a violinist's pants, I would be rolling on the floor laughing. Rowan Atkinson(Who is well known as Edmund Blackadder in the Blackadder series and as Zazu in The Lion King), performed his role as Mr. Bean perfectly! So, if you're looking for a TV series telling the wacky adventures of the silliest man in the history of England, "Mr. Bean" is no exception. I love Mr. Bean and the movies he starred in!
Mr Bean is still one of my favorite shows and never fails to make me laugh after watching all the episodes lots of times. I have always liked Mr Bean and revived the video box set, as an christmas present when i was very young. I think the humor is very easy to get, most of it is visual, with not much dialog, so the humor is understood by most ages. 
The program is based around something very simple. As I see it Mr Bean is an alien that is on earth and is struggling to adapt to human life. The reason why I think this is because at the beginning of each episode he drops down on from the sky into the street and then gets up and wonders off. I could be wrong. Mr Bean is "very child "like and some what "socially slow", and struggles to understand "normal people" , which leads to him getting himself into sticky situations .
 Like I said before the humor is very visual, and Rowan Atkinson makes the show funny, and I do not feel that many other actors could pull this off. I think its mainly the facial expressions that make the scenes funny, and his overall body language and acting, rather than the plot itself. It is very different from a lot of shows now, that have a lot of dialogue containing bad language, or shows that consider making fun of other people to be funny. 
Overall I think this is an all time classic, and is great for everyone. It can be watched as a family and the humor is easy to get and simple, but very funny. The acting is fantastic and clever with little effort from the brilliant actor Rowan Atkinson, and should be watched by all.


                
I remember when I was about 9 and I really loved watch Mr Bean when I was really. I wasn't born when it was out but I saw reruns on ITV and sometimes Cartoon Network would air it. If you haven't seen this show I am telling you now you are really missing out.If you are looking for a good comedy to watch I would honestly recommend Mr Bean even today.


                
Mr. Bean is a SITCOM. That it is what it is defined as. But I assure it possibly couldn't be far the concept and theme of the genre described any further finding common grounds in the studio audience's recorded laughter and the MC(s) doing goofy **** This is show so much beyond that and so much better than most things that came after. The fact that is short and every inch packed with glorious talent that the world couldn't help but recognize makes it all the better.Hats off to Sir Rowan Atkinson made the character of a lifetime and everybody who has ever seen him bring it to life knows it is highest elevation of solo performance. I had seen the show many years ago on a TV channel called Pogo and found it funny. Now grown-up and with a chance to experience to have the whole of that hysterical experience once and for all, I found utterly hilarious. Once in a while you find shows like this which make you scared you might hurt your bowels while laughing too hard cause you can't stop having no control over yourself in moments like this. I so admire this man now, and would place Mr. Bean even above my all-time-favorite, Blackadder Goes Forth.But even though I have praised a solo act so much does no way mean that the show could have done without various supporting cast chipping in and the punctuated music and sounds that the goofy stories being shown couldn't have done without. I would like especially mention Richard Curtis who was the co-writer on the many of the episodes of the show and went onto time-enduring classics such as Love Actually (Atkinson makes a guest appearance alongside some of the biggest names in the British film industry; It is also another must watch on my list) and About Time (It is really about that and a little bit more about love). I wish I had seen his movies after I started doing these reviews, as my policy is to onl write in about stuff I have seen fairly recently and within a week of having watched it. But if and when I do re-watch Curtis's classics, I will love to write about it. Also, my appreciation goes to Mathilda Ziegler who played Mr Bean's Girlfriend. She seemed very talented and had just right amount non-movement and expression in the 'chauffeur-queen-greeting' sketch (I think, i don't remember correctly) and then there were her exchanges with the titular character; oh how she tried things for love and failed hard to our delight (Schadenfreude never had a better example). I found out she is very successful actress who is considered an integral part of the British classic show, Eastenders and also happily teaches at The Norwich School (of Drama?) where she was seen discussing a play with Dame Judi Dench. So she turned out great and that made me happy.
Let's be honest and end it here. It is 2018 and that is 28 years since the show was released and all of people I mentioned and their common intersection on the intersection in the world of visual art are legendary material. This is a review only because that is what it is to be called, otherwise it is an exercise of self-reminiscence that I needed to perpetrate for posterity's sake.


                
Mr Bean(1990-95) means childhood to me, laughter and being sat down on the sofa with my father. As I meant so much to me growing up, one would expect that after watching it yet another time just a couple of weeks ago (I bought it in DVD) some of the things that made it great back then would have vanished, fade away. It hasn't been the case, though. On watching it for the second time (there will be a third, sure) I reckon I enjoyed it even more than the first time since now I'm more aware of the struggles that actors go through carrying out their job. On top of that, we have a character, Mr. Bean, who doesn't mutter a single word in a entire episode. Despite of all those difficulties, you'll end up laughing out loud and with cramps on your stomach. Looks like Mr Bean, as wine, gets better as time goes by. This isn't applicable to his old green car, though. It keeps getting rusty by the minute!


                
Mr Bean is pure genius, Rowan Atkinson plays a childish person in a grown man's body. Through a series of well directed episodes we see him fail at the simplest tasks and later conquer them. Mr Bean is something all of us can relate to and laugh at. You will struggle to find better feel good episodes than Mr Bean who has firmly made his mark in the comedic genre. It is universally loved and well received. Never has a show with limited to no dialogue conveyed so much, that is the brilliance of this series. I have never met a single person in my life who disliked this quirky and brilliant Individual. I was so lucky to have this released and shown during my childhood and it has never ceased to amuse and be funny. Mr Bean is a cherished character in the field of comedy.
