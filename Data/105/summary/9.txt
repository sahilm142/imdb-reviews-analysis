 Exceed to Excess

 A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Pacino gives a heart-wrenching performance as the modern-day Macbeth

 Al Pacino made it unforgettable

 " Want to play rough? . . . then say hello to my little friend "

 Say Goodnight to the Bad Guy...

 Brilliant acting

 What a movie

 Definitely a classic. They can't make it like this anymore

 The world is yours

 A good rendition of what's to come

 Epic by Brian De Palma

 Tony Montana is the gangster boss

 Pretty much perfect

 The Most Scorsese-esque Film Not Directed By Martin Scorsese!

 Scarface lathers itself in memorable quotes, stylised violence and mountains of cocaine.

 Sports cars, cocaine and excess; the 80s

 Extraordinary performance from Al Pacino !!!!!

 Pacino in full-throttle!

 Greek tragedy in 1980's Miami

 Say Hello To My Favorite Film from the early 80's...

 Engrossing!!!!!!!!!!

 Violent but moralistic gangster tale

 Master class by Al Pacino

 A must watch!

 Nice movie
