It's hard to get revenge on a bad movie. I am partially consoled considering I snuck into this theater rather than paying for a ticket. Still, this subversion robbed me of the cathartic argument over my refund with some hapless manager. Room stole two hours of my life, and the only way I am going to get value from that experience is to get the last word. Room has an extremely fertile premise. An unnamed woman (Brie Larson) has been kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for seven years, five of which she has spent raising her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). I am unaware how the book navigated this premise, but author and screenwriter Emma Donoghue had a bottomless potential of directions and selected none. The writing is too shallow to be a thought experiment on trauma or a character study. The narrative is too muddled by loose ends to be a simple "feel good" movie. Cult classic The Room had a similar degree of cohesion<U+0085> yeah okay no it didn't. Poor contractually obligated jokes aside, Room is simply aimless. This child grows up in a 10x10 room surrounded by sexual abuse his entire life and his lone complications are a paleness, shyness, and poor grammar. I have met children with comparable behavior from normal households. Children might be plastic, but no one is going to manage a full swift recovery from being born into this environment. The mother character is better explored, but barely. The strength of this woman while kidnapped is unbelievable, but interesting questions are raised after the escape. Her relationship with her parents, her friends, and dealing with new realties are all introduced and either dropped or solved off screen. This is a device derived from the book where everything is seen through Jack's perspective. But post-escape Jack is just cute and boring, not worth following. His narration of events is insufferable. The conclusion of Room is sickening. The film has the audacity to propose that mother and son will be able to leave this experience behind in the closing moments. This claim is beyond ignorant and well into insulting.For the sake of critical fairness I will mention all the two and a half things I enjoyed. The escape sequence is genuinely thrilling. Putting a child in peril is often a cheap way to manipulate the audience. It worked here, so credit is due. Second, the cinematography in the room itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic. Instead, the dimensions are simply defined and unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. The one victory achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside. Finally, the acting was serviceable. It is hard to completely differentiate the awful roles from performances, but the film did dodge some melodrama. The Oscars successfully suckered me into watching Room. I would like to just chuck this movie atop a pile of other examples where the illustrious academy failed, but I am apparently in the minority. There are some aspects of quality filmmaking here, but there is no prize for best drama for housewives. Room took a premise ripe with potential and failed to nurture it with a drop of ingenuity or realism. I was disappointed, and I refuse to believe I am the only one.
I usually trust RottenTomatoes and IMDb ratings, and while I might watch something that gets a 60% rating or above if the subject interests me, I will usually fall in line with the critics and reviewers on any movie that gets a 97% on RT or such high scores on IMDb. Well, this movie completely shattered my entire belief system, to the point where I find myself without a guiding light for the future.Many better worded reviews on this site have already captured the grievances that I had with this film, but I must write mine out so that I can feel better and move on with my life...It felt like it was 3 hours long. In an unbelievable feat of cinematography, they managed to stretch time so that a 2 hour movie felt like 3. The could have condensed the film into an hour and 20 minutes and I would felt less cheated. Outside of a short plot line, *nothing* happened. And every single thread that could have been interesting to develop was cut short leaving us unsatisfied and wondering. It's a movie about nothing. There was no great insight into the human cause or suffering, no great insight into the psyche of the captor, no details on the parental breakup, no real role given to the very interesting characters of the girl's real father or her mom's new husband. The girl was a b*tch (I mean, that's forgivable given the circumstances), but outside of sympathy for her, it was not entertaining to connect with her on any level. And every single time anything got interesting in the movie the scene ended.The real life is a lot scarier and way more touching than this movie, and unless one lives in a room, turning on the news every day brings a lot more real emotion and watching a poorly constructed movie with a very minimal depth is not that touching. What can we learn from a 5 year old and his view on the world? That could be interesting to see, sure, but even here, the monologues were short and infantile (because what would you expect from a 5 year old?) Jack was no great thinker at a young age. Yes, the world is full of wonder on the outside, whether you're 5 or 85.Perhaps it was a movie for those whose view on life has gotten so complacent that they lost any sense of that wonderment and listening to an annoying 5 year old describe his first experiences in the real world outside of his room brought them to tears because of nostalgia or remembering their own childhood innocence. Clearly, I am one of the few against the world who Loved this movie, so I'll be the first to admit defeat.Now, however, I'm left to scratch my head and re-evaluate my relationship with movie reviews.
I don't know if it was what I was smoking when I watched this, but I never want to sit through it again. I'm no seasoned movie critic, but I've got something to say. I immediately picked up on Brie's painfully unconvincing performance. The next thing I noticed was the terrible, soulless child actor who managed to be irritating and unlikable throughout. It felt as if the mother character was supposed to exhibit the pain and torment of both a captive prisoner and the mother from The Babadook, in which both were pulled off horribly. Looking up the movie brings up that its genre is Drama/Thriller, but I honestly could not pick up what this movie was supposed to make me feel. The man holding them captive is not intimidating whatsoever, he poses no threat and does not make me feel scared when the mother and son start taking risks. The tone changes constantly when your child actor cannot emote, stop screaming, or repeating themselves. Compared to decent child actors, the choice here doesn't feel intentional, as if the kid was mentally damaged from living in a shed. It felt like a lazy choice and I didn't care in the end if he survived honestly. The movie did not make me feel any sympathy for him. The kid totally breaks the pacing multiple times, ruining any form of suspense or thrill. He will say something stupid and unrelated, yell, etc. while another character is trying their best to perform. I know he is supposed to be an irritating kid, but I can't help but feel like he could've been done better. His monotone voiceovers come off as cheesy and uninspired, too. Total bore.The worst part? Nothing happens. It's damn boring. Events just kind of happen one after the other - I can barely tell when each act starts and the resolution just felt too.. easy? Simply getting out a-okay from the shed after having to vomit on her son didn't feel like a nice payoff. And the movie just keeps going - never ends. I hope I never have to sit through this again thank you Hanni for making watch this boring, loud, overrated movie. I see a gold film in here, but as of now I cannot fathom how this got any awards. The whole thing felt almost laughably bad if it wasn't for the lack of literally anything happening at all.
Very slow, disappointing and over rated! Judging by the reviews I though it would be a good film. Stop lying people...


                
I was close to turning the film off after just 15 minutes. It was just a whining boy and a lifeless mother arguing with each other. It didn't get remotely interesting until they tried to escape the room. There was no depth, and I also found it really difficult to understand what the boy was saying half the time (though he was a very good actor). I was looking forward to the film ending, but stuck with it as a friend had recommended it. Nothing really happened after they got out, the escape really was the only interesting part. I felt no emotion for the characters and was unmoved and bored throughout.
I do not understand how this would be an Academy Award nominated movie for best picture. This could have been a Lifetime movie of the week. In fact, Lifetime did a more interesting version of the story recently. The lead performances are forgettable. At no point in watching these characters did I feel like I was watching a special performance. The mother's performance was muted. There was no emotion in her. I felt the like the son was cookie-cut out of the "Michelle" from "Full House" role. We are supposed to think to ourselves, "Oh isn't he cute as a button," "doesn't he say the funniest things you ever heard" and "isn't he so aware of his situation and who he is." Suspense never builds. The movie ultimately is long and boring. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.


                
I hope the book is better than the movie....SPILOERS ALERT: 1= This story is told n the kids POV at first glance it might not be the best idea, because really this story is all about the mother decent (more on that later) but somehow it works out.2= The camera is sort of shaky and gritty I guess it fits at first for the beginning while they are still held captive in the room. Not only to make you feel like you're in the movie but also to force you to feel what both of them are going through and to also to sit the mood I guess.3=I simply don't get it if the captive mother (Joy) has a knife why wouldn't she just simply use it to force their way out. And why would the captor give his captive victim a knife in the first place, spectrally when clearly she hasn't yet lost all hope? Huh?! No not just a knife but why not just grab an thing to use as a weapon. Even before when she got pregnant, sure she tried once before but why wouldn't she just try again? Again huh? 4= There is a great Mother/Son sit up unfortunately they missed that up, yes at first in the beginning they did have a great relationship but for most of the time they mainly just yell and scream at each other. In addition I just don't get the kid's (Jake's) seemingly erratic mood swings. OK I get it he's frighten in beginning because all he knows is the Room, and now all of sudden his mother is telling him about life outside the Room, but even after when he and his mother were rescued he still remained bratty and having all of these erratic mood swings. I simply just don't get that.5= The night scenes are simply just way too dark to see anything now, I'm not sure if that was the attent or what, but in either case for that simply just cheapens the movie. And this is coming from someone that just sits in his dark room from time to time with little to no light being lighting the room from an outside source. And even that I could still see shapes of objects, but with this movie I don't know what was going even with sound.6= There is a poor sit up of the Kidnapper (old Nick), somehow feel his character just wasn't fleshed out enough.7= I feel the second attempt at escape wasn't will planned out enough, and what I mean by that is that they were so busy planning out the main plain they forgot t plain out the Plain 'B'.8= I just don't have any emonal or any kind of connection towards or against anyone in the film, which is too bad because I love Mother/Child Relationships. And speaking of I'm simply not sure if anyone in this movie is truly likable.9= At times during the movies I feel that it's simply too long. I often find myself thinking during the movie 'This movie is simply too long it should only be a 90min movie. And not a 2hr movie.' 10= However I do feel that there is a lot of plot holes in the movie: What happen to Old Nick. Did the dog ate him? Is Jake home schooled or does go to public school? Etc... but I guess those are just simply 'minor' plot holes.11= The good points: is that I do like almost everything that happens in the Room before the escape. Also I do like the music that went along with the escape. In addition I do also like the descent into depression of Joy (Mother) after when she was rescued. Finally, finally only at the end where the Mother comes back from what we can assume 'getting help' just after trying to kill herself some time after being rescued. They finally, finally show this excellent Mother/Son relationship in some kind of mini montage. All leading up to this neat and interesting ending (which I will not ruin for you).CP: I'm not sure the ending itself is enough to redeem it , but however I am wandering should I have waited to buy?
I've just returned from the pictures after watching this film. Great performance from the young boy Jack, but doesn't carry the film.Too many unanswered questions and holes in the plot lines. The worst was:-three slows and a stop, and robocopette leads them directly to the shed??? really??? I left the pictures when they found the dog toy behind the settee. probably not a great admission for a reviewer, but it had seemed to have slipped back into maudlin and lethargy. maybe I missed the best bits, but did I really have to get into a state of boredom before I could appreciate it? just because Jacks' like was full of tedium and repetition, doesn't mean the point has to be hammered home so effectively. there is nothing wrong with slow moving films as long as it is effective.films where you wonder whats around the corner rather than hope.I have only left a film once before. Hostel.Ankles. I couldn't watch anymore, and for completely differing reasons, and neither could I tonight.
With all the real life stories about women who have been abducted and kept prisoner in basement Ariel Castro etc why did they need to make a fictional movie about this topic? The true stories are more compelling. It's a depressing story that is slightly relieved when they are rescued.Brie Larson is competent at acting scared and sad but her performance is limited to these emotions. It was not an Oscar worthy performance, why she won over some better actresses is one of the mistakes of last year's Oscars. The little boy Jacob Tremblay is alright but there isn't that much that he can do.After the voyeur in us is satisfied by watching these horrible situations it's just a rather depressing movie.


                
There was no need to tell the kid that everything outside the room is not real or all the things they get is by magic.Her parents taught her to be nice, but didn't taught her to not trust strangers. A man kidnapped a 17 years old girl by asking for help about his sick dog!!! And she bought that. Writers, please, be more convincing.The kid's character was somehow annoying. And he was talking like a thinker! But the actor played well.When a Hollywood movie wants to demonstrate a drama, all the other things are at their best. For example, they got kidnapped, but the kid has good hair and skin and Ma's family are wealthy and in good shapes, so that there will be no more drama. As another example, watch The Fault in Our Stars.There's a skylight. She has a knife. Old Nick sometimes sleeps in her bed. Why didn't she kill him and try to escape from that skylight or to destruct the walls with something at worst? There were lots of stuff including a wardrobe that she could use to climb. Even if there was no knife, she could use other stuffs. She says that she tried this before, but with not a good plan. Why not try again? There were not much to do except thinking. Even he could have a phone on himself. See, ideas are coming...Eventually she ends up with a plan and without any training she decides to operate the mission at the same night!!!So, Old Nick is a fool!!!The man the kid ran into for help didn't even make Old Nick stop. He just let him go. At least write down the truck's plate number, please.When they go to the hospital after finding the Ma, the Grandmother's reaction was funny. No sign of happiness, shock or anything related. Even the whole family's reaction at first night was weird. Their just eating their lunch.It was slow and long with not necessary characters or events.After Ma is found, movie goes into a boring predictable phase.The idea was good, but the whole product didn't convince me that a young girl and her child would react to the events like this.
***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT***Sooooo...I stayed up late last night watching the movie "Room". Brie Larson won the Oscar for Best Actress for this movie, and the plot seemed like it might have potential. I guess now would be a good time to say once again...***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT*** If you don't want to know why I didn't like this movie very much then you should stop reading now.Brie Larson was pretty great, and the little kid was even better especially his narrative parts. The movie had plenty of touching moments, no doubt. I mean, even I couldn't keep the water works from flowing when mother and son were re-united in the back of that police car. Sadly, the main issue with this movie is that it peaks in the middle, and the last 58 minutes of the movie is filled with a bunch of useless drivel and irritating performances by some pretty decent actors (Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Wendy Crewson). Lit'rally, there was one seen that irritated me so bad that I wanted to reach thru my TV screen and smack someone. It's a scene where a "better-than-you" talk show host asks the mother if during any part of the seven years they were held captive if she ever thought of sending the boy away to a hospital or a shelter so that he could have a chance at a normal life. I just wanted the mother to say something like, "Hey, ya dimwit, do you even know what was going on? The guy had us locked in a soundproof shed with an electronic keypad lock on the door for SEVEN YEARS!!! The only way to "send my son away" would have been to send him with said abductor who probably would've just as soon slashed my son's throat and left his body in a dumpster than to risk having someone find him out because he was trying to give my son a chance at a NORMAL life!!"But, unfortunately, those lines were never spoken. The other detraction from this movie is that it doesn't take too long to realize that once the movie peaks that it's not going to have a succinct, defined ending. It was just a matter of waiting to see what scene the director decided to end it on. It could have ended a half hour sooner, or it could have played on for two more hours, but there was just no way to wrap it all up in a nicely wrapped package.Yeah, usually I like it when a movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood ending...but not when you can see it coming from 35 kilometers away. In the end I give "Room" 4 out of 10 stars; two for Brie Larson and two for her son. Everything else in the movie is just pure, unadulterated nonsense.RECOMMENDATION: Check out Spotlight instead. It won Best Picture for a reason.
Here comes another award-winning supposed to be slayer. And guess what? It is the polar opposite of the same description. There's nothing embezzled about this movie that will shine.
Brie Larson plays the seven year long rape victim mother "Ma" of a boy who's just turned five and who is very happy in achieving this feat. Jacob Tremblay plays the role of 'Jack' the kid. Ma has raised her precocious son on her own. She has tricked Jack into believing that that 'room' is the beginning and end of this world and that there's nothing outside but space. She has in fact made a bed, school, bathroom and what not in that cramped little space that her captor Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers, has provided her with. There's a television set also on which everything is perceived as unreal and false by Jack for the lack of exposure to the outside world.
In an attempt to make it more plausible for us to believe, and probably for Jack too, that they can survive and get out of there someday, there's a skylight at the top of the room through which sunlight enters in the room during the day. All in vain of course. 
There is basically no story. You see them living inside a room first and then living outside the room after when they manage to escape in an episode that could not have been more childish where Ma instructs Jack to lie still after rolling him into a rug so that she can pretend his death and mourn over it when Old Nick comes home at night to have his daily quota of sex with her. The plan works and Jack escapes finally, until he is caught by Old Nick and surprisingly, is left behind safe by him after one fat guy watches him get manhandled by Old Nick. You almost feel like screaming,"Why O Why?" Nick never comes back in the movie should be a serious enough indication about the kind of logic that was applied in the writing of this film. Nor does Ma ever get involved with him again. 
The real drama happens afterwards when the mother son duo have to live in Ma's parents house, who apparently have separated. Ma can't stand that house even since she isn't at good terms with her parents. Especially her father, whom she believes has been deliberately ignoring her son since they both stepped into the room. Ma also tries to commit suicide in a genuine attempt to apologize to Jack in a fanciful manner for ruining his childhood and treating him the way she did. The moment you think there's an interesting development being made the scene ends. And this happens enough times that you give up on the film altogether. 
As if the it wasn't enough tragic that both Ma and Jack visit that 'room' again towards the end of the film. That's when you realize your last couple of hours could have been more productive washing your car or making toast.


                
I didn't find this film all that realistic. If a mouse can find its way in, seems that a woman and a boy could have found their way out easily. It just didn't work for me. Escaping from bad parents though, that is hard. They keep bringing you back!


                
I watched ROOM because I'm a fan of Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, that's the only reason. The premise didn't really appeal to me, although I'm aware that it's based on various true stories about long-term captivity; if I'm honest I'd rather watch a documentary about one of the cases rather than this attempted fictionalised version. And, truth be told, I didn't like ROOM very much at all. The premise is okay, but there are two problems with this. The first is the running time: at two hours, ROOM is a film which is dragged out. I couldn't help but think it would have worked better as a thirty minute short. I thought the first half was bad, but once the characters actually get out, it really stalls. I know they'll struggle to adapt to society, I can work that out for myself, but I didn't need to see all those dragged-out moments and relationships with other characters.The second problem is that I hated the characters in this film, and not just the villains you're supposed to hate. Brie Larson gives a non-performance as the lead and the only thing they got right was in making her skin look manky. She's unsympathetic to me, a mother who seems to take a perverse delight in putting her child into danger over and over again, and I found her behaviour quite disgusting. With a proper actress giving a proper performance I might have liked this more. Even worse is the kid: a typically bratty American child whose overbearing and obnoxious attitude makes him no different from all the others we see in the movies. Why do American kids seem so selfish, self-obsessed, and prone to tantrums? Due to this child, the only thing ROOM did for me was to give me a headache. A pity, as Abrahamson's earlier movies ADAM AND PAUL and WHAT RICHARD DID were both very interesting, while this and FRANK have by comparison been chores to sit through.
Dont watch, episode 2 of star wars is ten times better
