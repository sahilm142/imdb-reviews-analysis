L.A. Confidential is perhaps, one of the best and most intriguing pieces of moving picture in the past few decades. The brilliancy of the script itself, deserves a standing ovation, because it is in my opinion, one of the most thought-out and nerve wrecking of its time. The direction by Curtis Hanson gives this intense and complex movie softness and makes a gentle approach to the audience, because none of the material is forced through, but instead it rests quietly in the subconsciousness of the audience the whole time. The plot is just awesome and stands out from any of the former (and later) police/criminal movies, because we get to experience the action behind the curtain, from a passive point of view. The plot has a great balance between tossing us into the action, and gently luring us through one mystery after another, trying to find the answers. The actors give the ideas of the script and the characters faces, and gives us a chance to relate and identify with the characters involved. Each of them delivers great performances: Spacey as always smart, sly and above all believable, though he does not exceed his brilliant performance in "The Usual Suspects". Crowe with his, so far, best performance in my opinion, with temper and depth. Pearce with an OK performance without really reaching the top, but fills out his character nicely. Devito is amusing and cool and does everything he can to contribute to this movie. Basinger with her Oscar-winning role, plays the beautiful blond convincingly and spices up the last aspect of the movie, with splendor and depth as well. Alltogehter this makes one hell of a good movie. Fast, smart, complicated, exciting, raw and above all believable and entertaining. Well done by the creators of L.A. Confidential.


                
Rewatching L.A. Confidential for the first time in 13 years, I was surprised at how much better it is than I remembered, and how much better it stood the test of time than other movies of its time, Se7en for example. It's a genre piece for sure - Curtis Hanson is not after originality, he uses every trick in the book and fills his film with genre clichÈs, but he does it so cleverly that those clichÈs seem fresh and effective like they haven't been in many years, subverting every expectation the seasoned viewer has, while never actually leaving or deconstructing the genre.As for the cast - not one of the three leads are among my favorites, but all of them are at least partly pre-fame here - Kevin Spacey after his first Oscar but before his second, Russell Crowe before Gladiator, Guy Pearce before Memento - and they all do a terrific job, especially Spacey. James Cromwell, one of my favorite character actors, is chillingly good, and Basinger and DeVito deliver too. Very few police dramas manage to work a large cast of unique and well-developed characters as well as this one, and it makes for one of the most entertaining, powerful, thrilling movies I've seen in a long time.


                
This is one of those films that may pass you by if you chose to watch it when other distractions are around. Along with the Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction, i made several attempts to begin watching this movie, only find myself switching it off after 1/2 an hour or so due to distraction or lack of attention. Don't miss interpret what am i saying, this not a sign of a poor movie, in fact quite the opposite; it is merely a warning that films such as these require our undivided attention, and without it they may seem to be less than they are.L.A. Confidential is a terrific thriller set in the 50's, with very realistic characters and an accurate depiction of the corruption and issues of the period.The cast includes Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Bassinger and Danny Devito, and every one of them delivers a top notch performance, and i have to say Guy Pearce was surprisingly the one that shone the most.Not to be missed 9/10


                
"Come to Los Angeles. The sun shines bright, the beaches are wide and inviting, and the orange groves stretch as far as the eye can see. There are jobs aplenty, and land is cheap. Every working man can have his own house, and inside every house, a happy all-American family. You can have all this, and who knows? You can even be discovered. Become a movie star, or at least be one. Life is good in Los Angeles. It's paradise on earth . . . (laughs) . . . That's what they tell you anyway. That's because they're selling an image . . ." So speaks Walter Winchell sound-alike Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) while we see sparkling images of LA life (and catch glimpses of movie stars like Marilyn, Frank Sinatra, and Deborah Kerr). Hudgens produces "HUSH-HUSH" magazine, a Hollywood scandal tabloid. Behind all of the glamor there is the seamy side of LA, and Hudgens continues his narrative: Mickey Cohen (by the way, a real person) had taken over the Hollywood crime rackets. His associate is Johnny Stompanato, Lana Turner's love interest (also in real life). But Cohen is soon arrested and imprisoned for income tax evasion. The control of the rackets is thus left open, and hit squads are knocking off the top lieutenants. Sarcastically pointed out are the LA police, who are not against planting evidence and grabbing a few bucks and administering beatings (and, as we soon discover, are not averse to using ethnic slurs, such as wop, jig, and spic). The focus of the movie is an exposÈ of the LAPD, warts and all.The tale ñ and it is a serpentine one ñ is about the intertwining paths of three separate police officers who maintain the peace by their own separate actions: Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), and Wendell "Bud" White (Russell Crowe). Exley is squeaky clean, while Vincennes is compromising and likes to keep his hands unsoiled. White uses brutal methods, to say the least. Despite their differing tactics, and the fact that they may clash with each other (and how!), these three are all basically respectable policemen. At an inquest, Detective White is termed a "thug" by DA Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), who has his own demons (see what happens to him!). White's partner is Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel), a loose canon if there ever was one. Exley was first in his class (out of 123) and chose the detective bureau against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell). Exley also disagrees with the stiff and sordid Smith, who uses extreme methods that are quite frankly illegal. Exley believes in following the code of honor to the letter. Meanwhile narcotics detective Vincennes works on the side as a technical adviser on "Badge of Honor," a TV police show like "Dragnet." As a publicity guy he is also involved in publisher Hudgen's scoops, such as setting up celebrities in compromising situations.The three cops are involved with unraveling the pervasive LA corruption like peeling layers on an onion. There are a series of events that initially do not seem to be tied in. But they are all related to the twisted plot. To mention a few incidents: A parole violator beats up his wife on Christmas night, Mexican suspects are arrested and beaten in jail (they had supposedly killed a cop), White meets prostitute Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) at a liquor store, an ex-cop driver by the name of Leland "Buzz" Meeks is shaken up by White, a corpse rots in a crawl space under a porch, and homosexual actor Matt Reynolds is found dead with his throat cut. But the main occurrence that sets the ball rolling is the massacre of six people (including two waitresses) at the Nite Owl CafÈ, where a recently dismissed cop (scapegoat?) was also murdered. Now the investigation begins in earnest. Several Negroes are conveniently implicated in the carnage; they have records (they know something about the kidnapping and continuous rape of a Mexican woman). Later Stompanato reveals to White about a missing heroin cache of 25 pounds. Meanwhile slimy rich pimp Pierce Morehouse Patchett (David Strathaim), owner of the "Fleur-de-Lis" prostitution ring, has "cut girls" (call girls who have plastic surgery to resemble the likenesses of Hollywood actresses, like Veronica Lake and Rita Hayworth). As the film progresses key characters show up dead. Then there is a shocking revelation at the one-hundredth minute mark when even a major lead is murdered (although there are red herrings). Stick with this one until its riveting climax at the Victory Motel! The atmosphere of the movie feels like it is late December 1953 or January 1954: the cars, the clothing, and the hairstyles. The film does not need popular music of the 1950s to generate the feel of the period. Note that except for Kay Starr's "Wheel of Fortune" (1952), most of the rather modest soundtrack comes from the 1930s and 1940s. Now one may complain that the unfurling of so many characters causes some confusion. But the story ñ tense and suspenseful all the way ñ does unfold quite neatly. And such excellent character development is often not seen enough in motion pictures. The performances of the leads are all at a high level (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and others) although Jack Nicholson did win the Oscar for Best Actor. Although her part was small, Kim Basinger won both the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. "L.A. Confidential" did garner the Oscar for Best Writing and also was nominated for quite a number of other Oscars, including that of Best Picture, Director, and Cinematography. It is indeed refreshing to see a big-budget feature that delivers. Roger Ebert placed this one into his top ten films listing of 1997. Some folks believe that it just might be the best movie of that year! It is certainly one of the best features of the 1990s decade!


                
SPOILERS:I had to comment on this movie because I just watched "The Black Dahlia" recently and the difference between the two films is quite extreme. LA Confidential is a great movie. It's received so much recognition and has so many positive comments I don't even know what to say about it. But everything that's wrong with certain other, similar films, is what's right about this one.The cast is great. The story isn't GOOD, it's fascinating and plays out in a way that's transfixing. I must agree with many that there are few movies of this kind around today and that's a shame. But there's not much negative to say on this one because the film gets just about everything right....and how common is that? I won't single out any one member of the cast but will say that my one complaint is that Kim Bassenger is the only one who won an Acadeny Award for this film. And I am glad she won an academy award because I'm a major Bassenger fan and always felt she was under rated. But there were other films she was better in then this one. And there's so many others in this film who were as good or honestly even better-where were their awards? There are certain films that one watches where it's almost unbelievable that they or the performers, don't receive even more recognition and this is definitely such a film.Basically anyone who likes Film Noir or just a really good film with a sensational cast, intelligent writing and a fascinating plot should check this out. My vote's 9.5 out of 10.
Whip smart comedy, a beautifully convoluted plot and Danny Devito. One of the best detective movies ever made.

I love this movie, it was intelligent, beautiful to look at, and had a fantastic screenplay.  I even like the length and the amount of characters and how you had to pay attention, which is not necessary with most movies these days.  My only gripe is the totally over-rated performance of Kim Basinger. Anyone could have played that part.  I always think that in order to win an Oscar there should be at least a moment of something approaching  memorable...where you can see why that person won...not in this case.  She added nothing to this movie; I thought hers was the worse performance in the movie (other than Danny DeVito, who was in another movie entirely).  Why wasn't Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and James Cromwell nominated for Supporting Actor?  Crowe could easily have won - he WAS that guy. Good, solid movie.


                
This film is the true definition of a blockbuster, that met and exceeded every expectation. L.A. Confidential is loaded with star power and filmed in a style of films thirty years it's senior. Based on a true story, Three L.A. Detectives, with different reputations and personalities, team up to solve a brutal murder that involves one of their own. The film is loaded with twists and turns that will lead you down many different paths and thanks to the quality of the acting, it's all believable. Just how good was this movie? In 1998, it received NINE Academy nominations, one of the highest number of nominations ever. L.A. Confidential also put Russell Crowe on the map. This film is an extremely exciting 'who done it' mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. The story is top notch, the acting is just about as good as it gets, and you will be hard pressed to find a better mystery. I can't possibly recommend this film enough!


                
L.A Confidential is a 90's classic and a great addition to the film/neo noir genre. What captivated me about this movie is great acting, masterful directing, and just a wonderful, well-written screenplay.This film is a mixture of police corruption and Hollywood celebrities that shaped the city of Los Angeles in the early 1950's.The acting is just fantastic. The three lead actors of Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pearce gave the best performances of their careers. I loved Russell Crowe who is a tough guy but with a soft heart for women. Also, Kim Basinger and James Cromwell gave memorable performances.Overall, this is a great mystery thriller that has a nice plot twist, a common theme for films of the 1990's. This movie should have swept the Oscars if it was not for Titantic. I rate this film 9/10.
"L.A. Confidential" is riveting from start to absolute finish. The interesting thing is that it is obviously set in Los Angeles; and I personally hate Los Angeles (I used to live there), but this is Los Angeles in a supernatural reality. There's nothing overtly amazing about this movie, but its almost as if you imagine every villain in this movie to be a demon (and the villains aren't always cut and dried, even the "heroes" are suffering from some type of pathos). In terms of my favorite Russell Crowe movie, this is it. I can't remember if they actually describe him in the movie as being all brawn and no brain; but that exactly describes his character. This is the first movie that I ever saw Guy Pearce in, and I fell in love with his acting ability. Kim Basinger is great too, and her acting is ironically understated. I lived in L.A. for quite some number of years, but this is an L.A. that I'm not really used to; but definitely like. There is a really strong visual component to the movie. Very vivid.
I loved this "L.A. Confidential", I thought it was awesome. The way the movie is set up so that you are forced to discover things as the main characters do was a great element. I also liked the way the reputation of Exley's character changed. At first he was seen as a whiney little brat just trying to get ahead. But slowly he began to earn respect with the other officers. And soon he was being known as shotgun Ed. I also liked Russell Crowe's character a lot too. The idea of a guy who goes around defending helpless women was an interesting addition and sometimes comical. For instance when the suspects from the night owl murder case begin to talk about attacking some girl Russell begins to tense up then BAM the chair in front of him snaps like a twig under the stress of his hands and he flies like a bat out of hell to try and learn how to save a girl in need. In the end the movie creates a very good story.
first of all i read in this page some people being confused over the fact if L.A Confidential was Film Noir or not ,Answer to that question is it'e a Neo noir . It is a very self aware, One of the the best of it's kind it's in the same league as The ChinaTown .The performance are excellent , starting from Russel crowe to Danny devito. This movie once again proved the unfairness of Oscars since none of the male leads were nominated for the awards.The story is very good .Everything about this movie is just awesome . if you haven't watched yet just go ahead and watch it , i can assure you that it would be one of you're best movie watching experience . enjoy


                
Horrible timing (thanks to the big stupid ship sinking movie) forced this excellent title to remain relatively unknown for a long time, although it did win some Oscars. This should have taken home Best Movie, and Best Supporting actor. Outstanding cast, great story, and a plot twist I will rank up there in the top 3 best twists ever. Everyone does a good job in this movie, even Babe's faithful owner James Cromwell (that'll do pig, that'll do)...Telling the story of how gangsters are being killed while drugs and organized crime run the streets of 50's LA, a new nerdy cop with a wee bit of an ego tries to make a name for himself. This happens while a "Never hit a woman" Attitude cop played perfectly by Russell Crowe tries to find out how a woman died, Danny Devito runs an underground magazine called Hush,Hush, Kevin Spacey lights up the screen as a poster-boy cop, and several other characters do lotsa other awesome things....eventually these separate stories converge and by the time the movie is over you are left thinking "why didn't i see this sooner!!??"....Better than the suuuuper over-hyped Training Day, or any other recent cop movie other than The Departed (LA Confidential is better btw), you'd be missing out if you don't watch this at least once.


                
I like this film and I watch the DVD infrequently. I know how good it is and for once I am not entirely sure why it works which for somebody who has not seen it is not very helpful but suffice to say it is enjoyable to watch. All those involved in the making of this film deserve a collective pat on the back for producing a very good and entertaining piece of work. I cannot give it full marks though because no matter how many times I watch it there is something in the film which doesn't add up and so far I have not been able to suss out what it is. Maybe its just me who is looking for something which just isn't there, but its just slightly annoying not being able to enunciate what the missing thing is. Anyway whatever it is apart, this film requires your attention because the subtleties are numerous and the interactions are superb at times. It seems there is a lot of hype surrounding this film and I would suggest anyone who has not seen it just watch the film and do not pay attention to any of it good or bad. Like I say it is an enjoyable film and well worth watching.


                
Curtis Lee Hanson's finest film as a filmmaker lies in 'L.A.Confidential'. Based on the 1990 crime fiction novel of the same title by James Ellroy, this film is a gripping tale that catches you right from the word go.A film like 'L.A. Confidential' deserves a standing ovation.... everything in here is so so perfect. Right from Direction, Production, Cinematography, Performances and in every other category, the film scores and leaves you awe-struck.The twists and turns in this 1997 classic are simply spell-binding. The climax is the most interesting, gripping and highly-charged sequence you'll ever see. The tension, the misunderstanding... everything is so well placed and executed, that you can't help but Stand Up and Clap when the final credits roll. Bravo! Performances are superb: Kevin Spacey steals the show. He's fantastic as comical cop. His exit is shocking. Kim Basinger deserved every bit of that Oscar she got. She delivers a fantastic performance and looks amazing in every frame she's in. Guy Pearce is excellent. Russell Crowe's role is meant for getting the claps and whistles, he's simply superb. Danny DeVito is effective as the journalist. James Cromwell takes charge in the second hr, he's excellent in the Kevin Spacey death scene. David Strathairn is very good; in fact, this ranks amongst his finest works.on the whole 'L.A. Confidential' is a winner all the way... A Fantastic Piece Of Cinema, that cannot be missed by even one cinema lover. Two Big Thumbs Up!


                
Recently, I finally had a chance to view this movie, having missed it a couple of times before. Man, am I glad that I finally got to see it!With the current Hollywood climate, where special effects seem to be far more important than story line or dialogues, it's refreshing to finally see a movie that actually has a deep and sensible story, as well as believable characters and good acting.Sure, the three main characters (Spacey, Pierce and Crowe) are sort of stereotypical and don't really show that much character development, but they at least feel like real persons with real shortcomings. Acting is superb all over (with even Danny DeVito in a serious role), with the possible exception of Kim Basinger. Yes, I know she got an Oscar for it, but all she has to do is look pretty and that's about it. The real winner here is the story, though. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is pretty complex without ever becoming overwhelming. Most importantly, it all makes sense and doesn't contain any huge plot holes I could find. Add to this a number of gritty and realistic action sequences, and you have a real winner. If only they'd make more movies like this...***1/2 out of **** stars (but very close to ****)


                
We've not come very far since this classic in terms of high quality cop crime dramas. Acting and direction is perfection.


                
Yeah, this movie just that: it takes bread out of the hands of The Papparazi because it basically lays bare the murky world behind the tint of glamour. Stars work for us, and take a hit where it hurts, at least where it would hurt most of our judgemental audience, ever willing to draw joy out of their work and then pan them for their lifestyle aspired to and looked-down-upon at the same time. Hypocrisy doesn't exist in Hollywood, it just exists within the audience that is often too coy, or too lazy to acknowledge their deepest desires.


                
Loved this film. Best cop flick of all time. Guy Pearce is an absolute stand out. Why isn't he in more blockbusters!?


                
Honestly the best A list film of its time. Lots of bad Cop flicks out there. This film pioneered the genre. Great acting and a non stop roller coaster


                
I just watched 'L.A. Confidential' again, after a long hiatus. It still holds up as an expertly crafted and vastly entertaining (though ultra-violent) neo-noir. This time around I was struck by the thought that 'L.A. Confidential' is a kind of classic Freudian psychomachia, with its three principal characters - Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), and Bud White (Russell Crowe) - embodying the three parts of the human psyche, as outlined by Freud a century ago. Jack, a suave operator and publicity hound, is clearly the Ego. Ed, who is educated, cerebral, prudish, and ethical, is very much the Superego. Bud, who is full of pain, rage, and lust, is all Id. A conservative critique of the American celebrity culture of narcissism just beginning to emerge in the early 1950s, the movie depicts Jack Vincennes as cynical, venal, and corrupt-at least until he has a change of heart and casts his lot with Exley in a crusade against an evil Establishment. Jack's death (murdered by corrupt LAPD Capt. Dudley Smith) two-thirds of the way through the picture allegorically signals the falling away of selfish egotism just as the late-stage alliance of Ed (the Official Hero) and Bud (the Outlaw Hero) signals psychological resolution for both characters, who then converge into one powerful force for Good (Ed overcomes his emotional and psychological rigidities and Bud overcomes his rage and grief as both men commit to battle a common enemy). There's a social class allegory here, as well. Ed embodies bourgeois ambition while Bud embodies working-class angst and despair. Their coming together figures for a uniting of the professional managerial class (PMC) and the working-class against a corrupt ruling elite: an unlikely occurrence in real life but deeply satisfying as a cinematic imaginary. One could also invoke Karpman's Drama Triangle here, especially in regards to the Bud White character. Victimized by his brutal father, who murdered his mother, Bud has become a perennial persecutor of woman-abusers and rescuer of woman-victims: an obsession that keeps him immersed in self-consuming melodrama until he turns his attention to a different kind of evil, i.e., the corrupt alliance between Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and the city's heroin peddling gangsters.
Definitely one of the best police/detective crime films every made. The cast speaks for itself - sometimes an all star cast can deliver something of substance!


                
Well doen to Mr Curtis Hanson.L.A. Confidential is a superb thriller set in the 50's, with realistic characters and a great depiction of the corruption and issues of the period.The cast with the now disgraced Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Bassinger and Danny Devito, and every one of them delivers a top notch performance, and i have to say Guy Pearce was the one that shone the most.I wish pearce woulds do more leads instead of becoming a character actor like he has.


                
Los Angeles, 1950s. A big-time crime boss has ended up behind bars and now the criminal underworld is in turmoil, all the players vying for the top spot. Amidst all this we follow three members of the LAPD, as they all try to live their lives, do their jobs and perhaps even get somewhere in life.What I like the most about this film is its complexity and its willingness to push the genre. It's a neo-noir film, emulating the film noir thrillers of the early 20th century. And it works as a very good example of that genre. Everything from plot to characters to locations to atmosphere is at it should be. But then the film keeps adding to the pile. Especially when it comes to the three main characters. Take Russell Crowe's character, Bud, for example. At first he's a brute, nothing more. His police work hasn't bothered with the framework of the law in a long time and for him his job is an excuse to let out the rage bubbling within him. But then we dig deeper and find reasons for that rage, and suddenly it isn't so black-n-white anymore. Oh sure, he's still a brute, but in a way that we can understand, if not condone.This holds true for the other two as well. They all start out rather unlikable and unsympathetic. But the longer we follow them, the more we start to like them. And yet they never let go of those central traits we detested at first. If that's not good writing, I don't know what is.Great movie. Nail-biting and twisting plot with a heavy pulse. Fantastic characters played by A-list stars. Superb technicals helmed by a talented director. What's not to like?
