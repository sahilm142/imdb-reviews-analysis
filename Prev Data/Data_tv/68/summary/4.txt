 Endless story......

 Severe flaws that become more apparent as the series unfolds

 Lost potential, over-hyped...

 Drama disguised as Horror!

 Doesn't live up to the hype

 Great, but poorly written

 Dragged out, very slow monologue ridden drama... minimal horror.

 Boring waste of 10 hours waiting for something to happen

 I really like to be scared but this is not the thing

 More drama then Horror

 Strong start, monotonous middle, horrible ending

 DNF

 Generic Horror movie, but as a TV show.

 Boring , Boring , Boring !

 Most overrated TV-show

 What happened to the horror?

 Reviewing With Josh! "The Haunting Of Hill House"

 Weirdest horror show

 Started off great then lagged

 Watch very little happen to a family full of buttheads

 After Episode 2: Boring!

 Peyton Place meets Scream. . . OR . . . where is the compassion?

 I wasted 10+ hours of my life. I feel duped.

 A very long horror movie

 Average
