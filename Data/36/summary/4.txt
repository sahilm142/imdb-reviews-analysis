 Leone's worst, as far as I have seem them

 Disappointing

 You're Kidding me right?

 Hank the Hubristic.

 SO OVERRATED! It's actually Leone at his worst

 Poorly Edited

 Poor

 In the West time doesn't fly, only bullets do.

 He loves his harmonica

 Strong on visuals, weak on story

 YUK!

 Overrated

 One of the most horrifyingly boring films ever

 Damn slow

 why do people like this.
