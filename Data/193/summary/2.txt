 One of the most intelligent comedies ever made

 I Think God Has A Sense Of Humor, Don't You?

 Stunningly funny

 A Masterwork of British Comedy

 Still one of the funniest films of all time.

 Classic seamless comedy.

 Ave Monty Python!

 One of the top 10 of all time

 Still funny, after 25 years

 Not necessarily laugh-out-loud every minute, but it's satirical edge and wit is as clever as the technical side of the film

 One of my all-time favourites

 Disgraceful depiction of the Popular Front.

 The greatest comedic moments in film

 Don't crucify me, but I don't think it's that great.

 red sea pedestrians

 The first time I watched Life of Brian I hardly laughed at all

 Accidentally, it happens to be one of the best critiques of the modern middle east...

 Satirical and cunning farce: you either love it or hate it

 A Comment on Our Gullibility

 The sublime side of life

 Monty Python and the Search for Religion

 It lacks the mad surrealism of "Holy Grail" and "Flying Circus," but it has its moments

 Delightful as well as hilarious film about a false and unwilling Messiah who wants to free his land from the oppression of Rome

 Just when you thought you were saved...

 Still wondering about that spaceship
