 The Sound of Silence

 The most realistic of submarine movies.

 Run Deep

 Intense and claustrophobic

 Not a masterpiece

 Okay movie

 Striking and potent, but it doesn't hit me emotionally

 Oh man

 Realistic Depiction Of Life On A German U-Boat

 Short Version Is Better

 Solid, authoritative, occasionally gripping

 "Das Boot" has the elements that make all submarine movies compelling, but with some twists and shortcomings of its own

 Director's Cut

 Great depiction of the gloomy underwater war machine
