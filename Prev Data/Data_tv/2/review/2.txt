I'm glad there's a fast forward button on my video player. Series started out interesting and slipped into dull dross


                
GoT used to be the show I couldn't wait for but now i find it stale, repetitive and the story just isn't moving forward since the end of season three. Gratuitous violence doesn't bother me if the violence portrayed is integral to the story or helping to move it forward but now its just shock and awe meant to appeal to the simple minded. Season 5 droned on for 7 damn episodes of nothing really happening other than rape, attempted rape, watching a small girl scrub a floor till she goes blind, barbequing another small girl, more small girls get tortured by a pedophile in a brothel and the queen is forced to walk naked through the streets (wow, martin and/or the show writers must really hate women). I get that the writers want to have intrigue and develop the political story but they squeezed all the action into the last three episodes and then it was so predictable, Stanis dies, Jon snow dies (everybody likes him so of course he has to die), Jamies daughter would die, Kalesi's flying fire chicken would save her and despite it all the story has barely moved anywhere in five seasons.GoT is one of the highest production value shows ever made without a doubt but if HBO seems intent on relying way too much on a set recipe of shock and awe, naked people, over the top violent situations (not necessarily violent scenes) and making the audience guess which key characters are going to die instead of an actual progressive story that people can remember from season to season I'm gonna tune out just from pure boredom.Actually I think I'm done with this crap show, I won't support shows written by pedophiles. Seriously anybody who writes that much sadistic sex and bad things on women into a story should be checked up on by the police. Red flag anybody? Ramsey Bolton should peel the skin off the parents of the child actors for their greed to allow their kids to participate in such scenes. I know they're actors and it's a TV show but they are also children! For Christ sake HBO, pushing the envelope doesn't mean abandoning the last vestiges of human morality for the sake of ratings.
I wrote an Amazon review when I finally got around to watching GoT and ended up with crazed fans coming out of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I was to not like GoT. After watching more episodes because - as GoT fans insisted - I needed to see MORE to understand/like the show - I decided that the GoT is not for me - even if the beatings will continue 'till morale will improve.. Watching more didn't improve my opinion really - it only made me feel nauseated. I felt I was only stating the obvious in saying that there is a lot of pointless gratuitous sex and graphic violence on GoT. For some - that's what they like about the show. For me - it's a needless distraction to what could have been a compelling story.Here is my original review of GoT:As a lifelong geek, I've been hearing a lot about GoT for a while now and had high hopes of it filling the much-needed niche for satisfying story-telling that I came to know and love in such shows as Firefly and the Lord of the Rings trilogy - or at least something intelligent, interesting, creative and well thought out. Visually, Game of Thrones is gorgeous - at least in the initial snow speckled scenes, where you see a group of heavily bundled up guys in a very stark snow scape. Just one look at the costuming and the beautiful filming really sparks any geek to say, "Hey- this might be really good." Knowing that the guy who was Boromir in LoTR is playing a major role also gives hopes and expectations of something really great.The initial scenes where one of the riders stumbles upon a truly grisly scene of carnage is difficult to watch - but at least you get the sense that there is something going on, some kind of mystery - that needs to be solved and the question of just who the White Walkers are is intriguing. So despite the gore, I was initially very much taken in.And that's about where my interest stopped as the first episode devolved into pointless scenes of violence, sex, nudity, more sex - still more sex - to the point where it became a bit absurd and almost dull. So sad to ruin something that could have been epic with a lot of sex scenes that weren't even in the original books. The gore and grisly scenes of beheadings and splatter porn also painfully reminded me of the really horrible rendition of the Hobbit, where something that was written as a kid's story (talking about the Hobbit here) was made into a gory display of constant sword fights and beheadings. It kind of reduces all of human existence to one that is animalistic and somewhat mundane: animals are born, they hunt for and/or find food, they have sex, make other little animals, fight each other for territory (possibly) and die. Fine. But a fantasy that makes it seem like all of human existence boils down to this common denominator (and nothing more) is not only uninteresting and uninspired - it's dead depressing. It also seems such a waste of excellent casting, costuming, cinematographic excellence and a story that might capture my interest - if the makers of the series wasn't so insistent and determined to fill every scene with sex of every sort and violence. All the flying offal and swinging tits really distract from what might have been an interesting story.The first episode of GoT was the most graphic thing I've ever seen - including that time when some college housemates rented a porn movie and that other time when some other friends had a halloween horror movie marathon. At least the gore in those movies had a point and made sense in the progress of the story, whatever story that was and the sex scenes actually were important in the plot - or at least vaguely important for the plot. (It's saying something when the sex and gore in the average horror flick is more meaningful than the sex and gore in GoT.) All the sex and blood splattered scenes of GoT just seem to make the whole thing less believable. It's hard to really get lost in the story and really imagine being there - when every scene is a blood-soaked and sex-filled rampage to the point of being ridiculous. The sex seems less real - because there's so much of it. The gore seems less important - because there's too much of it. The actual story is completely overwhelmed by the heavy-handedness all the sex and violence.If a fellow geek friend were to ask me about Game of Thrones - I would comment that the opening credits were really nicely done - with a sort of steampunk, nanotechnology and clever clockwork building of the map, castles, houses and landscape with these interesting ladders connecting various areas of the map. The opening credits was awesome - far more inspired than the series itself. The music is well done. The casting is brilliant (and would have been amazing - or could have been, if such talent wasn't wasted and drowned out by all the other stuff.) Visually (when every scene isn't blood soaked and/or crammed from end to end with pointless sex and violence) - Game of Thrones is really beautiful - with its gorgeous period costuming and sets and great cinematography. The actual story - the one that I might have been more interested in learning more about, if it weren't for all the gore, guts and grunts - is something I'm sad that I won't get a chance to know without reading a plot synopsis somewhere else. But the actual series just comes off as a porn flick with lots and lots of violence that happens to be set in the middle ages.
***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***I'm reading the first book and I'm about 200 pages in, so all of this plot is still very fresh in my mind for what I just saw on Episode 1. I don't understand why this show has such high reviews...perhaps the obscene amounts of gore and nudity? I only watched Episode 1 of Season 1 and that is all I will watch, for reasons I will make known below. Before that, I would like to state that this series may reflect the book, but it taints the reputation of the book and the reflection is not accurate in the least bit.Characters: First of all, the ages of all the children are older than in the books...which I'm assuming will make nudity of the girls...more acceptable to the audience??? Jon Snow is not at ALL what I pictured him to be...I mean it gives a physical description of him in the book...so there's no excuse for that. However, most other characters do look a lot like I would have imagined (esp. Arya and Ned), just not Jon.When the show began it completely butchered the scene of the Night Watch men who encountered the Others. The wildlings on the ground were not butchered and the man who deserted after the encounter only survived because he climbed up a tree. I know that seems like a small deviation, but for a series that claims to be so close to the book, the opening scene was screwed up. The execution of the deserter was handled well, but what about Bran's big question? Following the execution, the dire wolves scene was mishandled as well. The actor playing Jon did not look as though he was caught off guard by finding the runt. Speaking of that, all of the plot was rushed much too much. The actors failed at capturing the nuances, pauses, and facial expressions that these characters make. I was frustrated throughout the whole episode because it seemed to rush to the nudity, which is FAR LESS IMPORTANT than, say, the scene where Ned and Robert were underground paying respects to the dead. That scene deserved more than it was given. They didn't bring Robert and Ned's relationship to life, instead they make Robert look like a man-whore and they made him look soft (as in fat is whole life). The king should be hardened, but with a softness that only Ned can bring out in him...Mark Addy is NOT Robert Baratheon. No, no, no. I'm so mad at myself for watching this because now all of the faces of the characters will be associated with the actors...Boo!The sex scene with the Imp and all of the whores was completely fabricated...I mean that was just completely unnecessary. So many people are stating that this series handles sex maturely, but it takes something sacred and makes it absolutely disgusting. The book did not handle sex this way at all! Also, Daenerys is supposed to be a 13 year old virgin and the show had the actress who played her take part in two obscenely long nude scenes. I'm sorry (not really), but that actress does not act very innocent or afraid and I don't think she can because she is too willing to pull her drawers down. The sex scene between her and Drogo was not handled well either because it made Drogo seem way more barbaric than he actually is in the book (according to that specific scene in the book). They didn't have time to throw in the fact that he tenderly asked her for permission? I mean, really? That scene in the book ended in mutual agreement...(well as much as possible considering the circumstances). Now, the sex scene of Cersai and her brother was pretty much dead on for the book...I will admit that much. Pros: The costumes, props, and scenery are somewhat nice. That's it. You can't build up a show on nice backdrops and cool clothing though. Overall impression:-The necessary scenes were rushed. -Important details were completely neglected. -Some characters are all wrong and the ages of the children are fudged. -Sex has devolved into a barbaric act of overpowering women. -Most of the nudity is unnecessary and is OVERWHELMINGLY uneven (all full-on naked women) -Props and scenery are nice. -Whorehouse scene completely fabricated.PLEASE READ THE BOOK. You'll understand why so many of the people who read the book are angry. Now I'm off to read the book some more, but I think I've made it quite obvious that this show has dragged down my overall "A Game of Thrones" experience. I don't even know if I'll finish it now, but I definitely won't be back to watch this ridiculous adaptation of it.Last words: The actress playing Daenerys is so beyond wrong. I actually feel bad for the made-up character in the book!BLEH! >:(
I really wanted to watch this. I really did. And I really wanted to like this.There is just so much nudity that I am not continuing.This show seems to have lots of neat and interesting points to it. But I have seen ENOUGH of women's naked body parts. And I simply cannot stomach any more.Many people obviously don't mind this. But I absolutely hate that what looks like such an interesting show has been cheapened so badly. Some people may call it "gritty" and "realistic." I find it trashy. You can still imply things are happening without shoving it in your face.I am extremely irked because I simply love fantasy, and the mythical creatures, political situations, and intricate world makes me want to watch this badly.But I don't know if I can get through my disgust. I almost turned it off after seeing yet another de-robing of a woman (the second time with this particular woman) with her pointed parts in plain view, while a man proceeded to take advantage of her while she was crying. I mean, this show can stand on its own without all this stuff and still be successful. What is the point of throwing in this trash? Is titillation to draw in perverted viewer counts worth ruining what could otherwise be a very respectable timeless work? I believe that whoever decided to include this was directly, and absolutely, lowering the value of this work.Anyway, I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I was extremely disappointed.Additionally, yes there was a fair amount of gore. A lovely intestine hanging out of a freshly sliced man, maggots on a de-gutted deer with a closeup of its head and bloated tongue, be-headings with pretty views of the red neck meat. Ugh. It was not as bothersome as my prior complaint, but I don't have too much of a problem with gore. Also it wasn't as frequent.With so many positive ratings, I feel that my viewpoint should be put out there.


                
Game of Thrones is an intricate and interesting story that thrives off of shock, titillation, and disgust. It brings out the worst of human emotions within the characters and is a poor influence on the minds of its watchers (people who mostly just want an epic fantasy). The attention that this series has gained is an unfortunate reflection on our society. While I can understand the allure of such an expansive world with many amazing qualities of a good fantasy, I cannot personally support a series that makes light of nudity, women, rape, and violence. My rating is for the quality of the story as well as the cinematography. I hope that people everywhere will recognize the effects that this series has on their thoughts and emotions as they become immersed in this filth. I also hope that parents will recognize the importance of avoiding bringing these sorts of influences into the home.


                
NO MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!This review is solely based on the pilot episode. Or should I say the first 35 minutes of it. I know what you all are going to say. I need to let the show get going before I can make a formal review. To that, I say, "Get some expectations, you stupid moron!". I mean, are you kidding? Why should I have to wait? The opening moments of the show should draw you in, and get you invested. Not just be a 35 second shot of a rising gate, and then shifting to a shot of a group of stupid looking barbarians with accents so thick, I can hardly understand them. Then we get a couple of jump scares so pathetic, they won't even scare a 2-year-old, which only serves to show a brief glimpse of a member of a cannibalistic tribe(?). That whole scene was 8 minutes long, and I'm already almost asleep. With IMDb's stupid guidelines, that probably counts as a spoiler, even thought it's way too boring to be one, so I checked the box anyway because I don't want to be put on their blacklist, like I have many times in the past.We then get introduced to some random kingdom with Kit Harington living in it (OH NO!!!), and that's where the plot completely stops. Everything from this point onwards is just boring, uninteresting talking between a bunch of D-List actors sporting accents that only people living in the UK will understand. All the little interest that I had was instantly flushed away, and I was forced to spend the remaining time in the episode desperately trying to figure out the plot, and what was going on.Sadly the excess of talking is only the largest problem in this disaster of a show. Things such as lack of motives, and unlikeable characters only magnify this show's ineptness. As much as I'd like to talk about these things, I don't have all day to do this review, and I have much better things to do in my life than to vent about this stupid show. The visual effects and high production values are the only things saving this show from getting a 1.1/4
Firstly a confession - I hated this TV series so much that I only made it to the end of episode 6 before I gave up - I figured if I couldn't be won over in six hours it was probably never going to happen. Given this fact the reader should be aware that some amazing transformation may have taken place later which make this series far better than I am giving it credit for - though everyone I've spoken to who likes the series thought it was great from the start so I'm guessing the quality (or lack of it) is pretty consistent throughout. My objections? Firstly the writing is terrible - characters speak in this strange and special 'fantasy genre' dialogue which is stiff and comic (when it's not supposed to be) - the series looks cheap and nasty too - sets are often clearly studio bound with weak design, poor lighting and a strangely dated feel - it looks like a 1970/80s BBC Shakespeare production a lot of the time. The series also takes itself far too seriously - the whole thing has a portentous quality and apparently fails utterly to recognise its own silliness. I have absolutely nothing against the fantasy genre - the LOTR books and films are great - but this is a weak addition and I'd recommend avoiding it.


                
I was very surprised to see that in the low-rating reviews people often complained about the multitude of sex scenes, but nobody about the sequences that show explicit acts of murder, violence, aggression, rapes, animal cruelty... I agree, there is too much sex and naked women, but hey, are we already so desensitized as human beings, that those disgusting scenes are not a problem? My stomach is still confused. I had to cover my eyes at every 2 scenes. If children grow with this kind of evening movies it is just wrong. Also, the characters were developed superficially, in a poor manner. They were childishly divided between extremely good and extremely evil. If the movie is very accurate and realistic, why these non-realistic people? My two stars go for the costumes and settings.
Game of thrones.. it is coming to an end next year, I hope. Please no spinoffs or any other BS. Just end it. End it right. Have the freaking Whitewalkers win just so Hollywood doesn't try any BS. RR, you made more than enough money. Just end this so you can get back to not writing your books on time. But mainly end this so it stops going downhill. The past few seasons have been so by the Hollywood blueprint that it is disappointing. If there were another 3 seasons left of this show I would have stopped watching back in 2016. Whatever, at least the series started out well enough. I would rank it a 7/10 but people are overrating it so a 2/10 it is.


                
It's not good. It really isn't. I gave it a good shot, watched 4 episodes then got fed up and switched it off. Normally I love any cult or fantasy TV but not this one.There's too many macho long speeches and they get sooooo boring. I had to fast forward a couple. All that male posturing. Yawn! Double yawn. It's like Van Damme in furs, except at least you could laugh at him.I liked some of the younger characters, the dwarf and a couple of the females were okay. But then some old bloke would start gassing on again! To make matters worse every 10 minutes someone mentions the word 'brothel' or 'whore'. What a bunch of happy prostitutes all women are. Gawd even I know that's rubbish and prostitution done out of necessity. Oh, and there's too many characters! I was expecting something amazing because of the rave reviews so many chaps have given this. Sadly no.
My advice: first read the books and we'll see if you give it more than 4 stars. I don't think so... This is one of the best fantasy saga I've ever read. Can't say that about series - sorry. It's shallow and boring with no attention to the details, plain and simple. Nudity & gore is not enough to keep mature audience entertained. It's good for teenagers though. If you're true fan of the books - stay out of it! If you haven't read the books yet - do it now and learn the difference. I truly wanted this to be a great series, but it's not. Period. Saying it's true masterpiece and the best series of all times is just ludicrous and immature, unless you have no expectations at all.


                
This television series is absolutely disgusting. The storyline is inconsistent and there is so much unnecessary nudity and sex scenes. It is horrendous and it completely escapes me how people manage to enjoy this garbage. There is actually a scene in one of the episodes when someone gets grumpy after failing a jousting tournament, pulls out a sword and cuts a horses head off. Like, actually off of it's body. There is another scene in the same episode in the same situation (a jousting tournament) where someone gets a joust stuck in their throat and they start vomiting blood. I hope this series gets stopped soon, it is absolutely disgusting and gut-wrenching. My peers and siblings seem to enjoy it because of the occasional sex scene. It is so stupid that they would put pornographic scenes in this television show. I have no idea why such great actors would join this trash. Probably the worst show I have ever experienced and would rather watch My Little Pony than this stupid worthless trash which I hope gets removed before it damages anyone else. Get rid of it now. 0/10.
This is "Lord of the Rings" meets "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Great production values married to a total gross-fest. Let's see (obligatory spoiler alert, of course) though there's not much to spoil since I'm writing this now for a show that's been on six years. Anyway, let's start. Brother and sister having sex while the latter is married to the king, passing off their offspring as his. Human babies being offered up to strange zombie-like creatures by a father who marries his own daughters. A torture scene involving rats, various body parts cut off, rape scenes, castration scenes, this is basically Saw movie levels of entertainment. I'll give some credit for the first season for at least being original, as well as aforementioned high quality production values, but after that (I watched season 2 as well on DVD, then looked up the rest via summaries on the Internet), and the basic theme doesn't change, really. It's basically what new kinds of shock scenes can they through at us without anything ever being resolved. Good characters are killed (won't spoil it by saying which ones) and the rest basically scheme and backstab each other. Think of the worst types of office politics only played with swords and various other medieval weapons. Bleah! You feel like you want to wash out your brains with soap after coming into contact with this mess! 4 toilet bowls/barf bags up!
This show is completely overrated. First season was decent, but seems too drawn out. Beheading here, battle scene, several episodes in between. I hope it gets better, after all the hype it receives, it certainly doesn't live up to it


                
So you get friends coming to you to say "you gotta watch GOT, it's amazing!" and not being a TV watcher you ignore them. So you see the series on offer on DVD and you mention it to the wife and low and behold you get it as a present. So you watch it and hope that it is going to be something special. And low and behold you ring up your mates after watching a number of episodes and say "WFT is this shyte?" And then you remember these same "mates" were lollygagging about "Dexter" (which is possibly the worst mistake I have ever made when buying DVD's recommended by "mates". But back to GOT. It is not just that it is going nowhere but, like, Dexter, is it quickly running out of ideas. So far, some kid was murdered by a brother and sister but he doesn't die and wakes up not remember anything. Or does he? Or who cares? And then there is the nudity and sex. Right, it is HBO, and there is nothing wrong with a bit of nudity and sex, but Jaysus, we have watched a few episodes now and the sex business is just there for no reason. No "plot" advancement. No explanation of character. Nothing. Just sex. Alright there is an incest scene but interestingly not graphic and this is the whole premise of the story. As I said we are about 6 or 7 episodes into this shyte, but the story is thin and as of yet we have not had the obligatory lesbian scene (HBO trademark, come to that every Network trademark). Something to look forward to I suppose as there is feck all else. The 2/10 rating is for the character of the midget brother and Sean Bean. This rises it slightly above awful. And for those who will say watch the whole series and then comment I say do I have to? Really, do I have to?
Here we see what happens when too many people demand that the one hour is filled with the three hours needed. This series has always had one major problem. TOO MANY SUB PLOTS. Distracting the viewer with small titillating aspects of so many lines of plots is maybe the way the books were made but fails terribly in a 40 odd minute TV show. The people who are glued to this like chewing gum to my old boot are being hypnotized not by the quality of the show but by their desperate desire for it to be great and the single biggest event of the year in their entertainment calendar. I am so sorry to tell you that you are being led by the nose down a very boring path and watching this stuff only makes me feel that the efforts are a waste. Sad really because if the scrip and direction were done by people who actually know how to construct a narrative this show could be a real winner. The special effects and the costumes and all that are great but they are empty vessels due to the madness of the producers dictating to the direction and scrip people and the fact that they have very little say in the final product. This is a money making machine and to hell with the story. The real sad thing is how many people are still loving this stuff. Makes me wonder if they are actually able to be critical or just like lemmings and democrats voting for idiots to run the country?
After two episodes I still couldn't get into the series, there is no emotional buildup or character development. The rest of the series I fast-forwarded through, dwelling about 5 to 7 minutes on each episode. I stopped in episode 6.Here's what you get: -One-dimensional stereotyped characters "we don't care" for -infinite boring dialogs -bleak film sets devoid of modern visuals and CGI -animal killings: Nytheria (wolf) and the beheading of a horse early on. This wouldn't bother me if the wolf hadn't been the one likable character on the show -tons of bleak looking medieval stuff-a storyline excruciatingly following the book series -nudity could aid the series, in GoT it is misplaced and women are debased (e.g. A knight just beheaded someone and proclaims to his newfound lad whether he would like to lay with a woman now, as he usually does after gorefests - RIGHT in front of the queen). That's the general attitude towards females of the whole series "Spartacus" is female emancipation compared to this show -dated. The series might as well have been made three decades ago. There is nothing revolutionary. It is purely fan driven.-Devoid of fantasy (Normally I would like that, except in GoT this means more endless hard to follow dialogue on the backdrop of beak-looking sets).The best proof that this show is only watched by fanboys and girls can be seen directly in the IMDb ratings. 98% rate the show a 10/10. Fantasy at its best.


                
Repetitive, boring, more appearance than content (like most of HBO's hits, it's more a video clip than something with sense), extraordinarily overrated. Booooooooring


                
With the exception of the first episode (due to terrible CGI blue- eyed monsters), I found the first series of this show quite gripping, with tense drama and witty dialogue. The problem now is that it's more and more (and more) of the same, so what once seemed fresh and interesting seems hackneyed and boring. Personally, the CGI always brings me out of the story, and the whole dragon-based/supernatural side of things, along with such scenes as the woodenly-acted Red Woman queefing a ghost out of her foofoo, just make me roll my eyes. If you like ridiculous CGI fantasy, clearly this will appeal. Now, at season 6, we have hardly any of the wit and surprise of the earlier seasons, instead being left with lots of swearing, delivered by actors who don't seem like they can really be bothered any more. The scenes (now manifold) in faux-foreign tongues are embarrassing (perhaps this is a bit too subjective coming from me, as I am a linguist); in fact the whole thing is quite embarrassingly bad now.I also had a realisation whilst watching S06E01, that this is basically Star Trek (NOT a good thing).Actors now spend a lot of time stating literally what is happening or has just happened ("I did what I thought was right, and I got murdered for it, and now I'm back"..."He stabbed him in the back"...).


                
Can't beleive how many people got into this show , watched the first 3 seasons and the i was dying from boardness , it has such a slow pace where each episode made me fall asleep !


                
I never read any of the books, so I have no input there. Since this show is very popular, I decided to watch it since I was told how amazing it is. Well, thought I think the production is amazing and well-done, I find the story to be pretty boring and predictable. There are so many characters in this show that it is difficult to follow at times. I am just not impressed by the show and don't really care much about any of the characters. I think it's a pretty shallow show. Take away all of the BS with their long winded dialogue and all you have is a fight for power, wars, drinking, f'ing, and a bunch of laughable fantasy garbage. I cannot relate to any of the characters because the story is so ridiculous and none of them really open up, they are all just caught up in sitting on "the iron throne". If you're going to waste time watching anything from start to finish on HBO Go, make it the Sopranos over this!


                
Game of Thrones clearly has good production values, good acting and beautiful women. But the story (or the script) is a potent sleep inducer. After watching this show for 30 minutes I could not care less who was who, what are their plans, and etc. These tales of intrigue and high drama mixed with stereotypical notions of bravery, deception, honor, treason, loyalty, royal lineage etc. are so passé that one wonders why people keep on making films and writing books about them. Not to mention that reading and hearing about kings and queens and all this nonsense has become a chore. How many films and book have been written based on this quasi-medieval quasi-mythical ideals?That is why lately there are always some naked skin, exposed breasts, rough-sex scenes (e.g. Spartacus) on these productions. The directors need to get the attention of the viewer, right? Otherwise, people would simply turn to other things which are a little bit less dull, confusing and uninteresting.Can't those guys create more interesting alternative realities? Does it always have to be about power, murder and sex? All in all, this type of tale is nothing more than a medieval version of Dallas....Yep, you've seen one, you've seen them all!


                
The real trouble with this show -- Game of Thrones -- is that if you compare it to a show like Boss -- which is about loyalty just as much as Game of Thrones, but Boss is arguably current day and therefore has an astonishing measure of "real" application to our current political environment and current core political issues -- is that it is a fantasy. Admirers of the TV/Cable show Game of Thrones are so admiring of the show -- per having read many positive reviews -- precisely because it depicts the fantasy/fantastical story presented in the fantasy book so well. But the book is a fantasy. With so many admirers of the fantasy, a thinking/questioning person begins to wonder why all this "reach" and marvel into what even the author of the fantasy contends is fantasy that quite literally has little to do with our current times -- other than the predictable traces of "human nature?" I watched the first two episodes of the series and thought okay...it's okay as a story told...but there is really very little to be learned about mankind that we cannot discern from one day's daily newspaper from a large international city -- or a single issue of The Economist; who's in trouble now...and why? I suspect the rigorous and dedicated followers of this show need to be shown a "world" that is a distraction, not a distillation, of the more concrete world in which we, the living, live...to be shown a world without the current manifestations of political ambivalence and upheaval, the forces of political expansion and contraction, and most of all, political jeopardy and the individual's political polarization. But this is why I give Game of Thrones a 2-star rating; it is no real help to any of us now...it's simply a distraction. More soberly, why aren't we all wondering why we have been invited to watch the spectacle of slow economic meltdowns of the so-called PIIGS of Europe, all predominantly Catholic nations, without learning of any public, notable financial assistance from the Vatican? Let's define loyalty, really,...and for real. In addition, the CGI is strangely amateurish and the soft-core seemingly purely "eye-candy"; plaudits for so unsubtly targeting the 15-35 male audience to boost the ratings -- just can't get more vulgar than that.
Great acting, great photography, setting and story! The creativity and imagination is a joy to watch. I give this 2 stars due to the raunchy nature of the script, and its strong misogynistic elements that are in just about every episode. It seems to render this story much more a film of our age, rather than a timeless classic that it could be. Incidentally, if this is a mirror of our times, then we are headed for some dark days indeed. Some say Frankenstein was pushing the boundaries back in the day, and the violent 70's screamer horror films was another genre that pushed the boundaries. Screamer horror films evolved, and those old screamers are a rare sight these days. The same will happen to this series. We will move on, and evolve. I'm glad I didn't invest my money in the production.It makes me also quite sad to think the level of lack of respect shown in this series is required to gain public attention, which I don't believe is true. I think it cheapens the series, and is definitely unnecessary. My toes cringe every time a scene that is clearly sadistic and unnecessary comes on.A great story, told well and photographed beautifully, is all that is needed. This series has lost 2 viewers from my household after watching just Series 2 for these reasons. We doubt much will improve, and fear it will only get worse. After reading some reviews, it seems to be the case. We'll be moving onto far more worthy programs such as True Detective and Penny Dreadful - great story telling, great acting, photography and scenes that remain in line with the story itself. The Hobbit film trilogy will remain my firm favourite in terms of fantasy epics - a film that holds its integrity without relying on naked bodies and sadistic shock tactics to sell it.
