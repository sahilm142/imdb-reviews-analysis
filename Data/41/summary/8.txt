 Sublime Scorsese

 Infernal Affair is better

 Remakes are seldom as good as the original

 class A movie

 Tight, intense thriller

 Dark and brutal.Scorsese's most accomplished and entertaining film to date.

 Very good but not Scorseses' best

 An actor's extravaganza

 Average Scorsese - which means it's still a fine film, just not one of his best

 What great acting

 Good, but Overrated

 Good, but it lack the resonance of Scorsese's more notable works.

 Good Movie

 Divided Loyalties, Compromised Choices.

 pretty good adaptation

 incredible

 Very good - but not very Goodfellas

 Let's start with the bad points:

 Top-Notch Gangster Film - The Departed

 cat and mouse

 Boston PD Culture in an Unforgettable Crime Mystery

 Entertaining Gangster Movie

 not really scorsese's best work

 Wow!!!

 The Dee-PAH-tid, as we say here.
