 Unmatched masterpiece between gritty realism and epic fantasy

 Cut short, yet still great

 The world as we fear it

 Possibly The Best TV Show I Have Ever Seen

 Carnivále: what brilliance can give us.

 Simply Amazing

 Still my favourite

 utterly amazing! (tiny spoiler, but it's been said before)

 Excellent

 This will always be one of my favorites

 Quite simply the best (two) TV series I have seen
