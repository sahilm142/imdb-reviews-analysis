 Overrated

 This is a stupid movie about a stupid caper in which there are no redeeming qualities .

 Not A True Story...Just Very Depressing

 What?

 A terrible "film-noir" movie with no plot, no action and way too much gore.

 Strange, slow and nonsensical

 AFV, the Movie

 Oscar-Winning Writing Based on a Lie to their Audience

 How this was nominated for 7 Academy Awards I will never know

 Overrated

 O Hollywood, Hollywood

 Jon Monsarrat review: a gruesome true story? That's not entertainment.
