 The best classic spaghetti western in the Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood trilogy!

 One of my favorite westerns- a fitting middle section to the "Dollars" trilogy

 The Best of "The Dollars Trilogy" and quite possibly Leone's finest film.

 My favorite Spaghetti Western

 A Western Masterpiece

 Awesome bit of classic cinema- not on TV nearly enough

 One Of The Greatest Westerns Ever Made. An Excellent And Unforgettable Classic From Sergio Leone And Clint Eastwood.

 "When two hunters go after the same prey,they usually end up shooting each other in the back"

 One of those sequels that stays one step behind its predecessor, but it still freaking EPIC!
