 What happened?

 Current season over the top, too action oriented

 Sherlock (Season 3, BBC1)

 Series Three - Disappointing, Self-Indulgent, Underwhelming

 When did Sherlock become a romantic comedy?

 So close and yet so far

 First season was the best and it goes downhill from there

 Season 3 starting

 Great series that stands apart from the Holmes canon, yet is thoroughly enjoyable.

 Ben Cumberbatch saves Sherlock

 Trying to Compete with Skyfall and Captain America

 Scandal in Bohemia...

 Sherlock: Fun but Inconsistent

 Sherlock

 "Brilliantly" Overrated

 Not bad, not brilliant

 Good, but not as good as people rate it

 Mesmerizing....Absolutely brilliant..except 3rd season

 Great cast, awesome characters

 Like the show but could not hear dialog

 Sher Worth the Wait

 "Sherlock" exceeds the genre's expectations
