At first the show attracts by similar to "I'm Alan Partridge" humouristic moves, although you see misses here and there. After a while you start to think that the show isn't inspired by Partridge, but rather plainly steals from it. Just like South Park steals from Beavis and Butt-head, Simsons. But for people who have just seen Peep Show, the show appears very original. The weakest point is that many conflicts, which create the comedy, are not resolved but just dropped, going on to the next "situation". The characters also lack any kind of dynamism. It's still watchable, but it could have been so much better. One of the writers did go to work for/with Ianucci after Peep Show in the amazing "Thick of it"/"In da loop".
