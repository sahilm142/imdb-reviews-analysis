 Sensational picture with the greatest stars and winning deservedly several Oscars

 Newman and Redford: The One-Two Punch

 A happy, pretty, fun, engaging, but shallow film...pure great entertainment

 Undeniable star power and top quality production values lift this depression set caper movie.

 A mixed understanding for a kid of different time frame

 light, bouncy, and fun, if a bit shallow.

 Entertaining, but not as good after the first viewing

 Don't Go Into This with Your Expectations Too High

 Reeling in a big fish.... (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS)

 A stylish heist-comedy caper from '73.

 Not exactly timeless but all in all a good movie

 Good, but in the year that produced "American Graffiti", "The Exorcist", "The Last Detail", "Serpico", and "Enter the Dragon", did this deserve Best Picture?

 entertaining, yet not quite perfection

 Cleverly subverts expectation to deliver devilishly fun twists and turns.

 great cast, some fun scenes, shallow as all hell

 Cute movie

 Nice crime movie...

 Has Its Own Odd Charm

 A enjoyable film from the earlier 70s

 Fun Caper Comedy.

 Reunion isn't quite as fun

 Smart and slick entertainment, but don't look for any philosophical depth here.

 Star vehicle heist

 Newman and Redford re-team; the result is extraordinary; best con-man movie of all time...

 Inoffensive and Charming
