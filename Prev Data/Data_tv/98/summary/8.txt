 Superhero comic fan or not, Fantastic show!!

 When Netflix Errs, We Lose

 Season 3 a huge improvement - feels like season 1 again

 Marvel and Netflix create an outstanding product together (Spoilers)

 Great series

 An average season 1 and Super season 2

 Afterthoughts of watching Season 2. (9/10)

 interesting enough but not free from flaws

 For the whole DD team

 Excellent

 Now this was impressive...

 Great show on S01, however starting to drown for S02 and S03

 A good example of quality over quantity

 Uniform and Principal character

 It was great, yet there were some flaws
