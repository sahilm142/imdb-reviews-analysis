 Its a shame they has lost touch with society...

 Used to be awesome

 It's 2016, so of course even South Park went PC

 Long overdue for a scathing review: Vastly overrated, its cancellation is in order

 Extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely overrated

 South Park used to be awesome

 Immature audiences only

 Witty show turned into political weapon..

 This will probably be their last season

 Forced social laughter of the subconscious mind.

 Overrated Pop Cultured Nonsense

 Stupid show...is this all teens are worth?

 Terrible

 Overrated crap

 No

 Turned Nasty

 A perfect example of a television series targeted towards adults can be just as annoying and detestable as those towards children.

 Terrible, overrated show.

 The most f***king racist show ever

 Someone cancel this sh*t already!

 Lowbrow, Shock Value Iconoclasm

 Funny at times...blatantly disgustingly offensive for the most part

 My other review got deleted, so I'm reposting this.

 What is life about?

 Worst show ever!
