 This is what passes for a great movie nowadays?

 On Par for Modern Hollywood Remakes (Meaning it Stinks)

 Want to lower your IQ? Watch this.

 Absolutely hated it

 Mad Max? Nope, it's me who's mad!

 Waste of time and money

 Awful awful

 Mad Max fury road left me furious

 A travesty of the original Mad Max movies

 Half a movie, played twice!

 Single scene stretched super thin

 Repetitive, boring Mad Max barely does anything in it.

 Don't waste your time if you have seen the original.

 Saddening

 I understand why you liked it but I hated it

 Thank God I'm not alone

 No plot spoilers

 I wish I could vote minus figures!!

 Very very bad

 Horrible till the last minute

 Disgrace

 Abysmal.

 One of the worst movies I've ever seen

 Not a Mad max film.

 Reasons to Never See this Movie (from a Mad Max fan)
