 Exciting original story from Disney.

 Best animated Disney movie!

 hakuna matata..

 Brilliant story line

 "...we are all connected in the great circle of life".

 No worries this is a classic

 A fine animated story with lively characters and lovely music!

 Still love it after 12 years

 Hamlet with more Cats

 Disney's Pride

 A generation's cult-movie

 Not quite there for me

 The golden age of Disney right here

 Not Quite What I Hoped, But Better Than Most!

 The "King of the Jungle"

 Hamlet? Sort Of

 One of the best animated movies

 A gorgeous looking animation, with good voice acting.

 An A okay Movie

 The Lion King will work your tear glands- irrespective of your age

 Really Good!

 The "Beast" is my favorite from the Disney Renaissance, but "The Lion King" still has the popular vote

 This movie is a one of a kind Disney classic.

 Disney's last hurrah in the jungle

 The perfect film to make you happy when you're upset! :)
