 Brilliant, magnificent, imaginative, stunning, funny... Way too many adjectives left...

 The Samurai Called Jack

 If they could just end it..IT would have been a much greater MASTERPIECE than it is now!!!

 A Simple Drawing Meets With Cinematography, Presented by Tartakovsky

 Samurai jack is just to good!

 Best all-time North American animation (not a movie)

 Samurai Jack was a truly remarkable cartoon back in its day. And it still rocks!

 Time travel, samurai, post apocalypse and a fitting closing!

 Great
