 A Puzzle for puzzled people.

 Bah... it's all just hype

 I don't fully understand and I don't care

 Dopey.

 Open to Interpretation

 Really Strange

 No Payoff

 trite, inane garbage

 A ton of stupidity

 Overrated...

 They killed it, dead!

 DOES NOT DESERVE THE HYPE

 Atrocious 'American Beauty' for 80s kids

 Skip it unless you're in 9th grade

 Movie is awful

 Why Donnie Darko is bad.

 How a 9 became a 2

 painful to sit through

 Lame, shallow, "American Beauty" wannabe on Valium.

 lol?

 Darko beats Blade Runner?

 Over-rated, and how...

 Sober viewers will find it over-rated

 painful to watch

 Totally over-hyped,how can it be in the top 250?
