I got about halfway through this and had to stop and switch over to the Japanese version. For me as a Rurouni Kenshin fan it was a huge disappointment. I have for many years been trying to get my hands on a complete series of the original Samurai X Rurouni Kenshin. Being an even bigger fan of that series I was expecting an awful lot. Unfortunately I was expecting a bit too much. Though I found the animation to be as beautiful as I remember Kenshin always being. So very eye pleasing and the music to be magnificent. I was dissatisfied with the English dialog and I think even the voice acting direction. I felt the same way about the series so I wasn't surprised. As much as I love the way Watsuki san tells a story I was disappointed by the fact that this was nothing but the last five episodes of the last season of Rurouni Kenshin with a couple of effects added. If I hadn't switched it over to the Japanese version I may have shut it off out of sheer disappointment and utter boredom. So to sum it up for Kenshin fans skip it go directly to Reflection. For movie fans go for it. It's a wonderful story.
