Highly highly overrated for no reason.
Not the very best of its kind.A lot of holes in script. Go really slow and for no reasons scenes included just to have a feature film length video.
First dialog comes after 11 minutes start of movie.
Actual expected story starts after 1 hour.
No idea why it is that much rated. Only one thing goes good and that is acting nothing else up to mark a expected.


                
Hi everybody ! This film is just another "western". What is "western" ? We know that Americans adore money. Tons of money is their American dream. And they'd kill anybody who has big money. That's in their history, that's in their <U+0085> art also, if I can say "art". So, this is another piece of "art" showing you during more than 2 hours how they kill for money. Only personality of Mr. Eastwood and couple of non-standard scenes differs this chewing gum from thousands of others. Americans also invented such an "art" genres like horror, thriller etc. Also about killers and money. And <U+0096> don't forget <U+0096> they made Hollywood !!!, which produces on our heads with this "art" for a whole XX and XXI century. And they estimates these pieces of "art" 10 out of 10 here and anywhere. All that things made that real cinema art <U+0096> like Pasolini, Fassbinder, Bunuel etc. <U+0096> is completely dead now. Pieces of "art" like this replaced real art, and after seeing of this "art" <U+0096> now - your thoughts about how to reach more money replaced your real life, your love, your former principles. And <U+0096> are you ready now to kill somebody for money ? :) But ideas of kills in this "art" already became obsolete. Now Americans do it in real, on the level of governments, presidents and nations. God bless them. Maybe one time their American dream will come true and they'll do themselves for money, at last.
