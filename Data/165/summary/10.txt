 Don't Forgo Fargo

 The Best Effort From A Number Of People

 A masterpiece of Shakesperean proportions

 What a flick!

 Paul Bunyan territory

 Nobody seems to know that Fargo is

 Frances & The Coens at Their Oscar-Winning Finest!

 a strong cast and a very good film by the Coen Brothers

 A Black Comedy/Thriller from The Coen Brothers...Need I say more?

 Illuminating and awakening in every sense

 Fargo is Flawless

 Quite possibly one of the tn best films of all time...

 An almost perfect film in its genre.

 A Perfect Gem!

 Films like "Fargo" are why I love the movies, said Roger Ebert.

 My favourite Coen brothers movie

 Every character in the film deserves a film of their own .....

 Ordinary Good Defeats Ordinary Evil

 Excellent film!

 Great thriller, even better because it's humorous

 "Fargo" does not belong in the wood chipper, unlike the majority of films today

 "High end" level picture

 a great American film

 The Coen Brothers' masterpiece

 An essential Coen Brothers film, and essential in general.
