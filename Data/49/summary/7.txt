 Stop Rating Christopher Nolan Movies a 10!

 What can I say, wow!

 Nice movie, but the "twist" effect is growing a beard

 A classical style thriller, but it misses the mark

 This is an excellent film, despite some flaws that can't be ignored.

 Do We Like These People?

 Waste of Time and Energy

 A beautiful period piece, nearly ruined by sloppy plotting

 Well conceptualized and executed, a magical panorama

 My review is a spoiler. Well, the whole movie in itself is a spoiler

 Great entertainment, though it pigeonholes itself there

 Christopher Nolan's dark fantasy piece is smart, dazzling, but a little meandering

 Everyone can get a double <U+0085>..that to identical !!

 Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians.

 Some very interesting plot twists and originality, though it's a bit grim and lifeless

 Never ask me about my business.

 good, but slightly over-rated

 Clever,maybe a bit too clever..

 Magic behind the magic

 More like "Memento" than "Batman Begins."

 Casts a Magical Spell Even Over the Magic non-Fan

 decent

 Very good film - but need to pay attention!!! :-)

 Well made but off-puttingly complicated at times, especially towards the end

 A mixed bag of tricks.
