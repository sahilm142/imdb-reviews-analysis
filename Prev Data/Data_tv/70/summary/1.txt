 I absolutely hated this!

 What a joke

 Bait

 Who gave 10 star reviews, Cast, Crew maybe?

 Over-the-top slop

 Offensive in so many ways

 Near unwatchable

 What happened?

 Hated this

 What?

 Pure Fantasy 1950's

 From ten to zero in 60 seconds

 No Laughs

 Think of the crew.

 Could have been good...

 disapointed with the language

 Season 1 thumbs up Season 2 not so much

 A big boo from a New Yorker

 meh.

 Loved the first season...What went wrong in season 2? P-U

 I LOVE comedy, however....

 Were the adult themes really necessary?

 Turned me off totally in the first 5 minutes

 Crude and inappropriate

 Sad play
