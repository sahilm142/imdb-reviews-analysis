The film has used a lot of effects to increase the impact. But where it miserably fails is the absence or ignorance of crucial aspects:1. Underage children cannot be questioned by police without supervision. 2. How can the police target just one family so convincingly, just because one police constable is convinced that he saw Vijay in that yellow car. 3. Second round of Vijay going back to all the witnesses and the police reconfirming with all those witnesses looked very kids play. 4. There is no motive that the police even explored!! Wow. Better than Scotland Yard I would say.Hindi Cinema is basically either copycat or loose plots!!Again, where is the motive?
