 review film Dangal by AJ

 kind of movie you have not seen in a long time

 Sometimes some experiences cease to be a movie. They become much more.

 Hats off "Dangal", Mr. Perfectionist's "Dhaakad"

 This is how you make a sports Drama !!!

 If you are lying low in life, "Dangal" is the right dose of medicine to motivate and inspire you. Go and grab the tickets now

 And the GOLD MEDAL goes to... Mr. Perfectionist

 More realistic than sultan

 Extraordinary Movie A must watch

 Dangal is a go watch movie

 Dangal: an extraordinary film

 Dangal, a sports biopic, is a powerful, inspirational and incredible story of women empowerment.
