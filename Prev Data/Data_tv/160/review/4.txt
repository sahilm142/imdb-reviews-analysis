I really did because I loved hilarious ''Black Books'' that were also created by Graham Linehan. But it wasn't even remotely as good as that show.It has a lot of similarities with ''Black Books'' which are probably intentional. Three not so succesful or lucky people, i.e. an Irish man, a guy who's more of an awkward/shy/sensitive type and a token woman whose weakness is shoes in the same space. What differs is that ''The IT Crowd'' humour heavily relies on stereotypes while even though ''Black Books'' has some stereotypical characters its humour is not tied to that. I don't even know why I loved the silliness of humour in ''Black Books'' so much. I think it complemented the show for some reason. In case with ''The IT Crowd'', it came off as annoying and too childlish to me.
