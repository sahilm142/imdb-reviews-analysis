 Original but.. BORING

 A Love Story As Only Charlie Kaufman in a Phildickian Mood Could Tell It

 Flawed, but a gem nevertheless

 good but not brilliant

 Overrated

 Jim Carrey goes sentimental

 Can't a guy just change his mind?

 Very overrated movie that should have been better

 Pretentious clouds of a confusing mind

 Somewhat Immature Characters, Infinitely Beautiful Film

 A good change for Jim Carey

 My brief review of the film

 As soon as you get the plot, the movie has very little else to offer

 unique

 Total Recall Revoked

 Wonderful - yet could been much more...

 Weird, but wonderful look at true love and soul mates.

 Jim Carey reminds me of ME when I was depressed

 Entertaining, but highly overrated

 Good sci-fi romance but flawed

 Over-rated and Artificial

 The Surreal Life. (Spoilers)

 Kaufman's mind is a world of its own!

 just OK

 Over Rated!!!
