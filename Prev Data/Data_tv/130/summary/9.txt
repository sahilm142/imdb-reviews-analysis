 A 'toon for the BOOMER in all of us!

 Fantastic!

 Second best DC animated series, way better than JLU

 One of the best cartoons ever.

 One of the best pieces of American animation ever!

 Excellent debut

 The culmination of everything that makes superhero cartoons awesome

 I am happy I was around when this show came out
