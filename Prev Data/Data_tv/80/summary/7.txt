 I really can not understand where this Galactica stuff is going

 Flaws that spoil the Show (season 1 spoilers only)

 Starts off great, ends poorly

 Why so much hate?

 Splendid portrayal of a twisted plan

 A great, but sometime long-winded show

 Most LAME ending to any series EVER

 Overall an excellent SYFY Adventure

 Season 1-3 very good; Season 4 dreadful

 Exciting, but lacking substance

 Good Space Drama

 Equals the other two infamous sci-fi franchises.

 Could be better have they stuck to their plan.

 BSG The race of humans against the cylons to find earth

 A Flawed but Exceptional Series

 Good show, not great but not as bad as I expected

 Get Your Supernatural Mumbo-Jumbo Outta My Sci-Fi!

 A Stonehenge journey through space!

 At times brilliant, at times terrible

 Starts very good but jumps the shark pretty fast

 Battlle star season 2

 I liked it (beware: SPOILERS)

 I love it. I hate it. I am racked.

 Neither as brilliant nor as bad as some say

 Great start - seemed to run out of inspiration
