 This goes beyond mere entertainment - this is simply the best contemporary television has to offer

 Absolutely Phenomenal Show

 Captures The Full Chaos and Absurdity of War

 Brilliant war drama

 I'm glad they're doing this right (mostly)

 As Real as it can get, Entertaining & Educational.

 True to the Marines. on a personal level.

 A nice introductory first episode

 A work of immense power on its own, but also a great companion piece to "The Wire"

 Great show

 The best HBO miniseries besides Band Of Brothers

 Unique drama and worth watching!

 Great show about the War in Iraq that doesn't take itself too seriously

 This is History

 A Real Pragmatic Series

 Iraq War's Band of Brothers, Sans Righteous Cause

 My opinion

 As perfect as a war drama could ever be. When film becomes art.

 A landmark TV series
