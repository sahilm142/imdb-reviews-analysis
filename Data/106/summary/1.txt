 the worst comedy with highest rating

 200% Horrible

 Bloody Awful!

 Terrible movie, extremely overrated

 Monty Python is not a movie, its a mish mash of unfunny, ridiculous pseudo-comedy that seems as though its constructed by a 3 month old baby

 worst comedy ever!

 The research of the Holy Grail is just a pretext to a movie, in which the story after all is not so important.

 Not funny at all

 Disgusting movie. If you want to throw up voluntarily, watch this movie!

 Horrible

 Utterly Pathetic

 Unfunniset piece of aristocratic drivel ever dreadful

 Really people? "Best Comedy Ever"?
