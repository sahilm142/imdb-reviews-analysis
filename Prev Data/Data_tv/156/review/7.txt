I picked up season 2 very cheaply because I had heard good things, and after watching it and getting a few chuckles I then watched it online from season 1 so.. I guess I enjoyed it? I mean, I must have. But truthfully I remember very little from the whole series. I can't think of any parts that made me cackle aloud like a drunken witch, which is what I look for in a sitcom. The exception would be Jeff's leg saga, and I think that was mostly because his storyline in that episode was so incredibly BBC that it took me straight back to the 90s/00s, which is clearly not what this show is about. However, I have also tried to watch many, many sitcoms, both US and UK, where I've watched a few episodes and couldn't be bothered watching any more - Coupling was not one of those, and while I can't push it as a favourite sitcom, I can definitely push it as better than most
