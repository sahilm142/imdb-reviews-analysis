 Dark, brooding cinema - outstanding, but probably not for action fans

 Stellar cast , super interesting plot , brilliant direction , well written dialogs....now thats what i call Good Television!

 Matthew McConaughey OWNS this gem!

 Gripping, Gritty, Gnarley, Brilliant

 Amazingly haunting and beautiful

 Premiere

 Season One is Perfection

 Quality! ... Better even than 'The Wire'

 Astonishing

 Slowly but surely.

 Purely... Amazing...

 Season One - A triumph in filmmaking and a MUST see

 Overall it was great and it is a promising show.

 Once again, viewers prove they have no taste.

 If only second season needed a defense

 Perfection!

 I really don't give a 10 out easily. But this really earned it.

 Dark, Dark,Dark

 Dark, Riveting Crime Drama

 Wow The Real True Detective is back and It's great again.

 This is the big one.

 A Masterpiece
