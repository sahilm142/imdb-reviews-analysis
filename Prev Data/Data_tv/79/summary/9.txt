 The old west brought back to life

 Even when you get so little, you'll be yearning for more

 Great series

 one of my personal favorites

 Doubt there'll ever be a gem like this !

 The richest, boldest, finest and most anti-Western western ever made

 Brutally well written

 Late to the party...

 Deadwood is f****** brilliant, c***s*****!

 A great TV drama

 Tv classic

 Such depth in the characters. Addictive

 Profane Shakespeareana

 A TV sensation way out west

 This review describes the miniseries Deadwood without revealing the story line, while mimicking the linguistic style of the era, employed by the show's script writers.

 Great show

 Obscenities should be kept in Morse code

 A little disappointed.

 Stunning...but eventually gets lost in that massive set full of people.
