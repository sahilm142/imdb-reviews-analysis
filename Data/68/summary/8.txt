 America the Beautiful/America the Violent

 Great performances make stereotypes relatable

 The film is very open ended and endorses different appreciations. That's the secret of this film, I believe.

 "You have suddenly become my Hero"

 A mainstream film that is artsy.

 An odd movie that, in its final moments, manages to be almost transcendent.

 Insight into a typical American life

 "American Beauty" is a film that is seen through a lens.

 Good but didn't deserve its best picture win at the academy

 Shame it has AMERICAN in the title - but an inspiring film if youre feeling stuck

 drame is very true love passionate seen is awesome I'm impressed

 Strange American Epic Movie

 American Freakshow

 Lester-a likable guy?

 Look closer indeed

 Liked it, didnt love it

 Do not misconstrue this film. It's simply a social, satirical film

 One of the few very good films of the nineties

 Truly an American beauty!

 fascinating

 Cliche, or true originality? Does it matter?

 America looks in the mirror

 Good enough movie, but not at all one of the best...

 Good, but overrated.
