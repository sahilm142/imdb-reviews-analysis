 Poor taste

 Not an entirely effective movie, that still is a good watch.

 Or maybe,the holocaust was just some rock festival

 Very Overrated

 A very enlightening story!

 Is it that beautiful?

 Life is Beautiful- a great film (similar to "Maus")

 Life is Beautiful

 Excellent Movie

 Sensitive, careful and sweet, but...

 An interesting movie about a complicated subject

 Suprising

 Great Movie with Slight Confusion and Abruption!

 Enjoyable, but room for improvement

 Good Film

 Life Isn't Always Beautiful

 Touching but a little over the top

 Not sure it at first, strangely can't stop thinking about it

 Life is Beautiful

 Based on the Holocaust

 Not Bad

 Good drama with some humor

 Life is Tragically Beautiful

 Flawed, but still moving

 Life is beautiful is really two films. The first...
