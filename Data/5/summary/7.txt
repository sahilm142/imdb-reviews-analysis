 Great Film Reflecting American Cultural Changes

 Wonderful character portrayals, but too preachy

 Rewarding and thought provoking

 still works

 Quality work all around.

 A good courtroom drama but not without problems

 Great actors; somewhat preachy script; still worth watching

 still good, but overrated

 Gripping

 Quite intriguing

 It's ok

 Awsome

 is that possible?

 Intense Negotiations

 Oxymoronic Feelings on the content.

 Interesting and relevant movie!

 Convenient or otherwise...

 Intense court room drama

 12 Angry Men

 Twelve Angry Men

 My Take On 12 Angry Men

 Good characters, but predictable

 Guilty until proved innocent

 Once More Around The Table

 Good Point
