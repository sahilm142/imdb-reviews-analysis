 Gripping but oh so flawed

 Saw this before I could find any reviews any on here. It was called "La Casa de Papel (The House of Paper)". Here is my unbiased review.

 Entertaining

 Huge potential wasted

 A well made show which goes nowhere

 Something is missing.

 Great but with issues

 Great foreign show

 Good scenario, bad directed

 Copycat...

 Good show but not really special.

 As long as you don't take it seriously, it's good fun

 Too much longer

 Great premise, missed opportunity

 Loses its way

 Great First Season.....but

 Great! But what's with the outrageous SEXIST dialogue?

 Plenty of potential,but...

 Not bad

 Meh

 Good one.

 Dont watch it with english dubbing

 Becomes predictable

 Impressive and exciting.......but

 Very entertaining
