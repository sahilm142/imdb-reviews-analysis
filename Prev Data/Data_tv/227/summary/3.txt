 Is Borgen convincing?

 Well sketched characters, excellent direction, topping pace.

 Incredibly gripping, totally addictive, a TV series of absolute genius

 An English view of a Danish political drama

 Intense- Classy- Great Dialogue and Acting

 One of the best shows I've ever seen

 Most likely the best political television series ever made...

 Political dynamite

 Surprising Find, A Definite Masterpiece

 High quality viewing experience

 It cannot get better than this?

 Credible and fascinating insight into Danish politics

 Fictional political TV-show, which focus in the human aspects of the life of politicians

 A little slick, but still riveting

 Politics, policies and the cost of power

 Great acting, good overall plot, trivial subplots

 Borgen - brilliant

 Highly entertaining

 Danish Political Drama

 Danes bring home the bacon with Borgen. Sidse Babett Knudsen gets my vote

 Best in television drama!

 Yes, it is the best ever

 It was amazing ride for about two thirds of the road and few steps more but sadly ended in flames

 One of the best shows I have ever seen

 I liked Borgan, but didn't flat out love it. Is something wrong with me? (mild spoilers in 2nd to last paragraph)
