 The Good & Bad Of 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc'

 Brilliantly filmed but with an odd performance by Joan.

 It's a shame silent films are rarely shown anymore

 "You can claim that I am sent by the devil..., it's not true..."

 The trial of Jeanne d'Arc, very close up.

 Very "Hot Stuff" in the France of 1928

 Hard to Believe the Film was Made in 1928

 Horrifying Masterwork.

 Haunting Portrayal

 Just like a television news interview

 silent masterpiece

 Watch it for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance

 Powerful silent era drama

 The Passion of Joan of Arc

 A dermatologist's delight . . .

 One Of The Best
