 The amount of Pixar movies that are so much better and everyone is saying that this is the best one...

 Disneyfication of Pixar completed ... sad

 Disappointing. When did Pixar begin to steal from Other films?

 Extremely Over Rated Movie

 Too much of mexicano spices.. lacks a definite plot

 What is with the high rating?

 Nothing special

 Pixar copies book of life.
