 Bitterly, bitterly disappointed

 Terrible writing for Season 11

 New season disappoints. Politics ugh!

 Hello Children

 Weak Weaker Weakest

 Hello Children

 Disgusting.

 The New Doctor needs to regenerate ASAP!

 What was it about and what is about now?

 Just does not have the quality anymore

 Watching each new episode in the hope that Series 11 will improve.

 Terrible story lines so far. Drags on. PC infested & droll.

 Used to be an Incredible Show

 Diversity isn't the problem it's the writing

 John Pertwee would not be impressed

 And I thought it couldn't get any worse...

 Where is The Doctor ?

 Doctor Who 2018. *smh*

 If it's not Broken Don't Fix it!

 Makes the Colin Baker years look exciting

 A quick review of the first series<U+0085>

 Could have been better

 Simply the worst season at all

 A great sci-fi ruined by PC propaganda.

 I feel this series is the final regeneration.
