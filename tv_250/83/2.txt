Watching this show in 2019 is difficult. It appears to be made for a special kind of audience. I'm watching it with/for a woman, but entered with an open mind. Now almost done with the first season, I am surprised at the high ratings this show received. It's over the top offensive with only semi interesting characters. The one clear, bright spot so far has been Claire. But who knows what they will do to her character. I am told it gets better. I will adjust rating accordingly...
