 One of the most Breathtaking Animated Films of all time.

 Wonderful movie, a must see 3D

 Truly Moving Picture

 A Nutshell Review: How to Train Your Dragon

 A Beautiful Tale Of Adventure And Friendship For People Of All Ages

 Hiccup a young Viking befriends Toothless, a young dragon.

 a definite must see

 A heartfelt movie with a beautiful message

 More mature than "Shrek"-probably one of the best animated features ever made.Worth seeing

 A different beast than the book, but still a powerful, entertaining film.

 If you feel that Toy Story and Shreck are missing SOMETHING IMPORTANT - this movie is for you

 Pure movie magic

 The best 2010 release I've seen so far – and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a very long time

 Almost as good as Pixar movies.

 My favourite animated film

 Exceptional Film

 Great

 Watched it a 100 times, and...

 How to Train Your Dragon

 How To Train Your Dragon = An Epic Success

 A brilliant and beautiful story about what it means to be human

 How to make you cry.

 This is how animated movies should be done

 What can I say, except awesome.

 I Want A Dragon
