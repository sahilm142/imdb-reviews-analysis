Everyone has heard of this movie. The general assumption is that this movie is one of the greatest gangster films that there is. I am inclined to disagree with this. Yes this movie has some great moments, but it does not deserve the credit it gets.Al Pacino is a great actor, and I don't deny this, but there are to many times in this movie where he seems to overplay the part. Michelle Pfiefer is horrible in this movie, probably her worst performance ever. As for most of the other actors who did not make it big, it is very much because they're not good actors. Al Pacino's brother in the movie seems totally scripted.Anyway, as for the plot, it is boring, and overused. Man gets rich, and the people he stepped on to get there come after him. It's boring and predictable because of this. If I were doing this movie, I would cut so much. We don't need the restaurant scenes which do not advance the movie. We do not need a scene with Al pacino in a hot tub having the same argument he had around 5 other times in the movie.


                
Having seen this over 20 years ago on cable, I recently decided to see if the ensuing decades could make me appreciate this, and the answer is "NO". I thought then, and think now, that the film overall and its lead performer were and are over-hyped to the point of hysteria. I even call into deep question Pacino's standing as one of America's "great" actors; for all those who love "The Godfather" series (I'm not one of them: I think they, too, were equally overdone), I suggest taking a gander at such "classics" as "Author! Author!" (ever wonder why he doesn't do more comedy? A quick glance at THIS will tell you why). In the hands of the unreliable De Palma - for every "Carrie", you get "The Fury" - a man who, despite his blatant desire and attempts to be Hitchcock reborn, is at heart a lover of the overblown cinematic image, Pacino is allowed to give his tiresome ticks and actor's tricks full display in a part that SHOULD have been played with subtlety. If the film is watchable - and it basically is NOT - it is due to the scenery-chewing; Pacino hardly starts with nibbling; no, instead he swallows each shot whole, inspiring his fellow actors to go overboard along with him. For each laugh one has at the actors' expense, however, one needn't be Cuban to be even slightly offended: SURELY the makers of this film could have found more than ONE honest-to-goodness Cuban (co-star Steven Bauer being it). The accents, particularly Pacino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, are akin to those in the old "Speedy Gonzalez" cartoons - you almost expect poor old Juan Valdez to be trotted out, too, just for good measure. But how about the story-telling, the technical aspects? Well...once you get past the hammy performances - quite a struggle, believe me (you'll be tempted to bring out the cloves and pineapple) - and the assuredly overcooked direction, you are left with something that rambles on for nearly 3 hours, though with little reason beyond wanting to become a modern-day "epic saga" a la "The Godfather". As for the LOOK of the film, it's not an especially attractive one: the print on cable - no, I haven't seen the DVD and don't care to - STILL looks downright muddy at points, as if copied from an old slow-speed video tape, though this could be as much to do with pan-and-scan as anything else. The much-lauded score by Giorgio Moroder is, THERE: not memorable, as with "Midnight Express", but not a total failure and it DOES fit the cool, shiny-plastic beauty of Miami and its denizens as shown in this film (everyone seems to be dipped in either oil - the "natural look" apparently never made it down in Florida - or sweat, for Pacino never seems to stop perspiring, which is understandable, what with the effort it must have taken to overact AND speak with some marble-mouthed, faux-Latin accent). No matter, though, what the film looks like, or how it's written (poorly; example: Michelle Pfeiffer, sporting one of her other noses, just disappears towards the end), or how long it goes on (and on, and ON, AND ON...), people watch this for the acting, the violence, and the love of the "f" word (uttered 182 times), and they have dubbed this and "The Godfather" as "classics", all of which goes to show that if you say it long enough, some people believe it.


                
I have tried to watch this movie and see the masterpiece potential. All I see is a foul mouthed, woman beating, drug dealing criminal who has the worst Cuban accent I have ever heard. This is one of Pacino's worst performances. Maybe it is a guy thing. I just don't see the value of this movie. True, it shows that for a while, being in this business has its high points, yet in the end your evil deeds will catch up with you. If this was the point the movie was supposed to convey to the audience, it didn't work. It seems to me most viewers became entranced by the way he climbed the "gangster corporate ladder" and the lavish lifestyle his crimes afforded him and completely ignored how it all ended.


                
I hated this movie!  I don't think I hated it because it was bad, but because so many people thought it was good.  What was so good about it? There was no real plot, unless you consider; A crook from Cuba, who gets rich in America, by becoming a drug-dealer, and killing people.  That's not original.  There are plenty of movie out there that are like that, which are better.What I hear a lot of people say is that they liked this movie's ending the best.  I thought the ending was the worst part.**SPOILER AHEAD**A guy, who's mean to his wife, smuggles drugs, and kills his friends, die. Like I cared?  This guy was a jerk, and got what he was asking for, but HIS DEATH SCENE WAS CHEAP.  It was nothing original.  And they tried to make it seem tragic.  Like I gave a **** that he died.**SPOILER END**Also, I didn't think it was smart to cast an Italian guy to play a Cuban. I don't care if Pachino has 25% (if that) cuban in his blood, he looks Italian and he is considered an Italian.  Michelle Pfeiffer was a joke too.  She always cracks me up, when she tries to act sexy.  She's pretty, but she can't be sexy.1/10
This is one of those films that comes along that everyone seems to get but you. Al Pacino's character is supposed to be a sort of antihero, and yet i felt relief when that ridiculous Schwartzenegger wannabe shot him in the back at the film's climax. The whole film reeks of a cheesy over the top acting and really bad special effects. I laughed when hector fell through the window onto a concrete colored pillow, when Tony tried to hide his face from the squirt bottle of blood being squeezed at him as his friend was being sawed to pieces, and not to mention Brian DePalma's "cameo" during the club assassination attempt. DePalma always soaks his movie in this dark creepiness, which worked for movies like Carrie, but feels woefully out of place here. The film suffers from bad pacing as well, the scene where he goes home to meet his mother could have been cut by ten minutes. The only interesting things i can say about this movie is that DePalma's camera-work is generally excellent (though this is one of his lesser films), but it's his storytelling abilities that makes his films suffer. The 80's- soaked atmosphere doesn't help either. I am baffled by this film's popularity, and hope that true movie buffs can see through the hype and see it for what it is: Overrated.
So I've heard all of the stories about how so many famous people love this film and how it's the greatest film they've ever seen, so I finally watched it to see what all the fuss was about and was seriously disappointed. I mean don't get me wrong the directing was good and editing was well done but the story wasn't that great, and I think the movie has gained so much of its status because of all of the MTV rappers and shows where it is promoted so these kids who want to be just like the celebrates buy the film, and are brainwashed to think they should like it because their favorite celebs do. Anyway all in all, overrated and not worth my time.


                
Just a very bad film.The only thing that is good is Al Pacino´s acting the other:TRASH!!!!!!!!Bad music,bad screenplay..............................RATING:1 or maybe 2- out of 5 BUT only for Al Pacino´s acting


                
It is fair to say that I despise "Scarface" with a passion. What is even more interesting is that I did pay money to see the film when it was first in movie theaters. I found it to be a very hammy exercise in excess. Al Pacino was not only chewing (cursing, shooting, murdering, etc...) the scenery but it seemed like all of the actors were on the same terrible plane. There was no such thing as perspective in this movie which makes me appreciate other films within the genre like "The Godfather" movies, "GoodFellas" and in, arguably, Pacino's best performance, "Donnie Brasco".I don't think director Brian DePalma knew when to put on the brakes in some scenes and it made "Scarface" all the more worse while watching it.Sometimes some movies should not have been given the green light and I believe "Scarface" is one of them.


                
OK here we go...This is easily the most over rated movie in history. I truly don't understand why people really enjoy this one. It is such a slow moving plot. If you want to see this..change your mind. If you do actually waste your time putting this in your DVD player just skip to the end because that is the only good part. Pacino did a good job as a mafia man..he should thats all he ever does. Maybe its just me but this movie is a complete waste of 3 hours. I do think it should be re-made because if you put Martin Scorsese in the directors chair it can be done a lot better. It needs a modern day flare on it. I don't know who should play Tony because Pacino is too old now. There are a couple people I have in mind, one of them is Johnny Depp who is arguably one of the greatest this business has ever seen..and if you have seen Donnie Brasco then you know it can be done by him. The other one would be Edward Norton, he is another one of the greats and can do anything. Those are the only two I think are capable.


                
Scarface is, in my humble opinion, an overrated heap of typically excessive US junk violence movie. Some good acting though. Al Pacino is a great actor who unfortunately seems to choose rolls in movies that I myself personally dislike, for example all those incredibly overrated Godfather nonsense movies. Michelle Pfeiffer did very well too. I have to admit though, that the 2 hours and 50 minutes did not at all seem to long.


                
I have seen Scarface several times, and I still don't get why people think it's the best movie ever. It's really badly done. De Palma was really losing his touch by this point. He had one more good movie up his sleeve a few years later, The Untouchables, but otherwise, he was pretty much on a downward spiral by the early 80s.
The acting is over the top, things just happen, but you don't feel anything for the lead character. He just goes forward. It feels sometimes like it just keeps jumping around, 3 months later, 3 months later, let's skip filling things in. And what was up with Robert Loggia's Lopez character and having only one bodyguard on his payroll?! When Tony Montana implied his boss was low key, he wasn't kidding.
The only good thing about the movie is the hilarious, quotable lines that have become part of pop culture parodies.
Otherwise, this film really doesn't deserve the praise so many keep giving it.


                
As a Character, Scarface will remain timeless. His costume design and charisma makes him as memorable as the Godfather. But unlike The Godfather, Scarface feels much longer. If you are expecting a action packed gangster thriller. turn around. This film is predominately made up of Scarface going around talking about cocaine, doing cocaine, selling cocaine. So much cocaine. like a lot of cocaine. its very boring.
