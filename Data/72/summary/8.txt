 Incredibly Intense WWII Submarine Action Drama

 Believable, above all, and a WWII submarine movie, all the rest is just intensity

 Longer Director''s Cut The Version To See & Hear

 Nail-biter masterpiece about the hard conditions of forty three sailors on a dangerous mission during WWII

 MY REVIEW: The Boat of Hope!!

 A View From the Other Side

 The only submarine-movie you will ever need

 A film that gives us a view of WWII from another perspective

 Perhaps the most striking quality of the film is the ability to portray the Nazi soldiers with disconcerting verisimilitude.

 a sympathetic German U-Boat story

 Compelling Drama

 Waitin' 'round to die

 Stunning film of life on a German U-boat in WW2

 problems with the story

 Real-Time War

 Interesting thoughts about life aboard a U Boat.

 Reel Look: 'Das Boot'

 The U-Boat

 The Horror...

 Total immersion into confined space

 A thrilling masterpiece of film...

 Could have been one of the most incredible films ever made...but isn't

 The suspense in the most out

 Exhausting
