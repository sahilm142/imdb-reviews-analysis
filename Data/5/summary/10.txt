 Excellent

 No bombs, no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less

 If you only ever see one Black and White movie, make this it.

 Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....

 Terrific drama with some of the greatest actors in cinematic history

 A classic.

 a tight ball of male-dominated classic cinema

 The All-Time Great Liberal Agenda Movie

 From guilty to no guilty,,,,,,,this movie is true masterpiece.

 "You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?"

 Beyond a reasonable doubt

 An Anti-Cinema Classic . Know What I Mean ?

 Just watch the first 30 minutes of it and you'll put it far away on the very top of your list!!!

 Is "12 Angry Men" a GREAT or NON GREAT movie? Gentlemen of the jury, your verdict ...

 An absolute must for anyone who considers themselves a film buff

 12 wonderful actors.

 I find this movie guilty of being a masterpiece.

 With brilliant acting from the jurors, an engaging script and fntastic direction from Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men knows what it is doing and succeeds masterfully at it.

 "Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth."

 Excellent performances that stand the test of time....

 The Lonely Juror

 A perfect movie with interesting and mysterious story

 Greatest movie ever
