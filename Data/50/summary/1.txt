 Redux is a Travesty, Travesty, Travesty!

 REDUX OR ORIGINAL?

 The boredom!

 Pretentious twaddle

 The most boring film I've ever seen

 pretentious piece of sh.t

 A ridiculously overrated film

 Boring

 Snooze feast

 Beware

 Why I rated it a 1/10

 Crappola!

 The Boring and Offensive Apocalypse

 Terribly self-indulgent film lacking any substance!

 Coppola's finest work until Captain EO

 Disaster of a movie

 Apocalypse Ego.

 the horror was sitting through the redux.

 I love the smell of raspberries in the morning.

 One of the WORST films ever

 VERY boring and highly overrated.

 What an abomination, libelous piece of 100% Hollywood fiction!

 Crap Movie!

 Awful!!

 A movie that makes a big deal out of trivial information.
