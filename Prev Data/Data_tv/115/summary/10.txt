 Faboulous

 The serie that changed my life

 This show rocks

 Magnum Opus of the medium TV, Mad Men are terrific and genius.

 Best TV Drama of All Time?

 A perfect cocktail of early 1960s Mad Ave Noir

 Genius

 One of the finest dramatic achievements in television history

 Ran it up the flagpole; everyone saluted

 It's just like a retro ad! It's nice to look at, but lifeless...

 The 60's . . .

 Artful Depiction Of The Dark Side Of The Early Space Age...

 So much talent it hurts

 Mad Men is the best TV show of all time

 Challenging and honest.

 A Sophisticatedly Classy Show for a Sophisticatedly Classy Audience

 Show that demands a lot from the viewer, but gives it all back :)

 Excellent period drama about the decade of change

 Superb show

 Serious educational drama with documentary elements

 Madly Accurate

 quintessential show

 Method to the Madness

 No other show has hooked me this quickly and thoroughly since the Sopranos.

 A toast: to AMC's MAD MEN
