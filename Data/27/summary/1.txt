 Eh?

 Total Rubbish

 How the plot has been spirited away...

 Hated it

 No idea what I just watched

 POOR

 Disappointed

 Did not impress me

 Horrendous

 Dreadful

 IF you really want to know if it's worth it....

 Are U Kidding Me?

 I just didn't get it

 Oh common! Be truthful

 Terrible anime fodder. Grotesquely over rated.

 A waste of time, unless you are a pre-teen

 Japanimation Sleight of Hand

 Meaningless and boring

 A Movie about a girl trapped in a mystery land with good and evil spirits.

 Cheap, idea-less trash in the worst sense of the word.

 Not Impressed at all.

 A Junk Film

 I hope Lilo kicks Chihiro's butt!!!!!

 The most overrated animated film ever

 Horrible and inappropriate
