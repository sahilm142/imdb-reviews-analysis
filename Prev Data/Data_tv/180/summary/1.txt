 Erased (Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi) Anime Review

 "Are you stupid?"

 masterpiece

 Taut and Gripping Thriller

 An incredible thriller

 Boku dake ga Inai Machi - A True Masterpiece

 Good.

 Wow.., Amazing Show!

 Giving away 10 stars is not easy! Respect it!!

 I wasn't amazed.

 Realism with some sweet Supernatural Touch is the Key of Success of this Anime

 The winter anime of 2016

 best anime ever

 A gripping one which falls short on many aspects

 Great start, but it falls near the end?

 Erased

 A lot of potential ruined by an obvious plot and a bad antagonist.

 Quite the show

 nailed in 12 episode

 Terribly overrated

 "You're an idiot."

 Pretty great, I highly recommend (spoilers below)

 Excellent

 Very excited lol
