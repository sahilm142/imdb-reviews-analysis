 Some Like it Dark - Wilder and Dark Comedy

 corporate sex ladder

 They don't make 'em like this anymore

 A precise satire

 Bosses and employees conflict in a New York insurance company

 Bringing both comedic and dramatic elements together, and it's all so incredibly watchable...

 Definitely Not A "Lemon" Lemmon Movie

 For anyone who's ever been trapped and lonely

 Surprisingly downbeat but ultimately rewarding comic drama

 A lovely gem - with some hard edges!

 "I said I had no family; I didn't say I had an empty apartment."

 Charming, quirky, and tender

 A Classic Comedy!

 Not at all a comedy, but still a fine picture

 A Dark Romantic Comedy

 One of the most creative ideas for a movie ever

 Two key words here: Excellent Comedy

 A Black and White Delight

 A classic comedy-drama

 Nostalgia at its finest

 Classic Film Re-released At The Right Time

 Evergreen Classic

 A story about abuse, mostly, with an ending that could just be happy

 I remembered why this impressed me so much

 A movie that deserves the term "classic"
