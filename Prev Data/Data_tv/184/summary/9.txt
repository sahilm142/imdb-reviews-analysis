 Psychological thriller at its finest.

 The thriller you've been waiting for on T.V

 Dark and better than I expected!

 Dexter would like them

 So very nearly a masterpiece

 Best series for psychological crime lovers..

 "Deep and Dark"

 'Hannibal' - "This is my design"

 As Dr Du Maurier Said, Hannibal Can Be Persuasive

 Good enough to eat

 Intelligent, artistic and ferocious Hannibal Lecter

 Hannibal invades our televisions

 Home run.

 Excellent but NOT for every taste...

 Atmospheric, subtle, textural and engrossing

 Hannibal - Jederman for the 21st Century? Episode 2 and more

 Unexpectedly good...

 Hannibal - Dark, Intellectual & Gory

 So Glad Hannibal is Back

 Is this the next big TV show? I believe so.

 Less intense that the real story.

 Perfectly Narrated - Thriller

 as exciting for adults as a Saturday Serial was to you as a kid.

 Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen SHINE in this stunning adaptation of a cult classic

 grotesque beauty
