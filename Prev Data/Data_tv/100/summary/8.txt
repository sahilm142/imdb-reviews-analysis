 Great series

 Well made crime series worth watching until the end.

 A solid entertaining crime series well worth your time

 Main story is OK, but I love the details

 The main character interaction is the thing.

 Great Detective Series - One of the Best

 Starts off slow but is a good "Scandi-Noir" series

 Take it to the bridge

 Music intro

 Interesting cast of characters fight crime

 I like the pacing and dark nature
