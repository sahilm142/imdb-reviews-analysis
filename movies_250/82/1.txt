It baffles me how Aronofsky has managed to fool audiences and critics to rave about not one but two nonsensical stories in the last few years. If you manage to keep your cool under the barrage of imagery thrown at you from frame one you should be able to spot plot holes in this film so large that they'll make Pi's nonsensical ending look like plausible narrative.What bothers me most with these, apart from the fact that they make this film essentially pointless, is that they are all there simply to justify some supposedly shocking visuals. I can't help it, I must provide a list.
SPOILER SPACE (you shouldn't care, but it's the rules)* * * * * *1. Harry goes to a hospital to get his obviously gangrened arm cured. A doctor spots him as a drug addict and calls the police WITHOUT TENDING TO THE ARM FIRST. The weirdest thing about this is that the poor guy is later sent back to the hospital to have his arm cut off. The good part for Harry is that he should become a rich man in no time, after suing the doctor, the hospital and probably the police.2. A dealer won't sell heroin for money, but he will trade it for sex. He could hire all the hookers he wants with the money he'd earn selling the heroin, specially considering he's the only provider for the whole city at that time. Still, all he wants is to see some lesbian sex live. Apparently, this is in the movie only to create tension between the lead and his girlfriend. Well, and to show Jennifer Connelly naked.3. A previously healthy old lady is allowed to degenerate mentally to the point of being confined and given electroshocks without receiving any help, even though she's been shown previously socializing with many other people. For some reason the only person who realizes she's sick is his son, who doesn't care much for her anyway. Not that he does anything about it, either. Strangely enough, there's a shot of her friends waiting in the asylum looking worried while she receives electrical discharges without anesthetics.4. Even though heroin can be injected practically anywhere, the lead will do it always in the same place. Even when the spot becomes a purulent wound he'll still do it the exact same position. Not an inch above, not in the other arm, not in a leg. Right in the middle of the wound.* * * * *END SPOILERS (but there are more of these, believe me)You know, I wouldn't worry about plot holes that much if the filmmakers had set out to create just a series of disgusting images to show them around. The thing is they didn't. They made an attempt to create something vaguely resembling a storyline, they even had a shot at a subtext. They simply failed miserably. Let's see, this film seems to be about addiction. The points made about addiction in the film are:a) Many people have addictions of different kinds.b) Addictions aren't good things.c) Disgusting things happen when people let their addictions go out of control.and maybe, just maybe...d) With addictions at first you'll feel good, but then you'll feel bad.So much for depth.But we might also have some character development, right? We could neglect story and subtext and still have strong, compelling characters.Just we don't.Even the best of the characters we're shown is one dimensional and flat. Everything the characters are or do is put there to be dismantled later, which makes it all feel like a cardboard building in a Godzilla movie. It's fake and cheap. Everything. The leads' love story, the mother-son relationship, friendship between Harry and Tyrone, and between Sarah and the other women. Nothing feels real because Aronofski only cares about the next cool shot.This film might get you distracted enough the first time you watch it and make you to believe there's some depth behind that nauseous feeling in your stomach. In the end, it's just empty imagery planned to create a nauseous feeling in your stomach.If you want imagery go and see the latest summer blockbuster. It might at least be some fun.
This is a film. This a film addicted to gimmicks. SPLAT! Any questions?The pretentiously titled REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a film that is dark, depressing, achingly dreary and laughably awful at every turn. It is like watching a drunk or an addict wallowing in self pity, only to have him interrupt his moaning and groaning with fits of uncontrollable laughter. You don't know whether to pity him, laugh at him or just smile and slowly back away. Nowhere else will you find a film so self-consciously solemn and meticulously constructed, yet so hysterically out of control.The film is about the evils of addiction, so it is ironic that the director is hopelessly addicted to clichés and gimmicks. One thing for certain is that director Darren Aronofsky seems desperate to impress somebody. He's the kid with the thesaurus who can't turn in a book report unless he makes certain that every word is at least 10 letters long. Only now he's a film school kid who just figured out how to use all those cool gadgets on the camera. As such, REQUIEM is wall-to-wall cinematic tricks: split screens, split-second editing, fisheye images, fast forward, time lapse and oh-so many really nifty-crazy-weird camera angles. It all goes for that Oh-wow! factor. But when every scene is a calculated stunt, then no individual stunt has any effect. It's like an opera screeched in only one note or a room where everything is the same shade of blood red. The overall effect is shockingly effective only because it is all so unrelentingly unpleasant.The idea, I suppose, is to clue us in on how hyper the world must seem in a drug induced haze, but that is rendered meaningless since the film goes hyper even during innocuous moments. Indeed, what passes for everyday reality is presented as being so melodramatically arty or intensely overwrought that at times Aronofsky has to resort to the overtly ridiculous to even get back our attention. By the time Ellen Burstyn, as a diet pill-addicted old lady, finds herself being terrorized by her refrigerator, the film takes on the air of a particularly grotesque skit from Monty Python. Even worse than Aronofsky's taste for psychedelic overkill (apparently inspired in equal parts by bad MTV videos, trendy TV commercials and grade-C drug movies of the 60s), is the director's self-righteous arrogance in assuming he has something original to say. Drugs are bad! Gosh, who knew? But even the simple nobility of that sentiment is buried under the sludge of his technique. The fates of the four main characters is so extreme, and so extremely presented, that the film unintentionally trivializes the very lecture it so pompously presents. Their fates -- insanity, mutilation, prison and sexual degradation -- are presented, not with an air of remorse and pity, but as a manic cinematic freak show. This is REEFER MADNESS on LSD; scare tactic propaganda served up as if it were from a crazed evangelist. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the poor actors are forced to overact just to keep up with the hectic pace of the film's stylistics. Lost between their obviously phony Nu Yook accents and bug-eyed emoting, there is little room for genuine characterizations. Indeed, the fact that any semblance of a performances even survives is remarkable considering Aronofsky's veg-a-matic editing style. There are poignant moments, however fleeting, when the actors reveal depth and complexity in their characters, but those instances of subtlety are brushed aside as Aronofsky rushes to get back to the grandiose surrealism. Can there be anything more personal than an addiction? Yet, Aronofsky has made a film that is frenetic, yet cold and mechanical. This is a film by a filmmaker who has no faith in either his message or his audience. Everything is hammered home, amplified and repeated because the director doesn't think we will get it if he simply states the obvious. Had Aronofsky just made a simple little horror movie, maybe his gross-out/creep-out/freak-out stylistics might have been amusing. But he has tackled a serious social issue and reduced drug abuse to the level of being a Freddie Krueger bogeyman. I don't doubt the sincerity of his anti-drug rant, I just find it hopelessly condescending. It is film-making as shock treatment, designed to beat the viewer down to the point of vulnerability, exhausted and ready for brainwashing.
I really can't see what's so great about this movie. It was a big disappointment to me. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't. I think after seeing the reviews on here my expectations of the movie was way too high. The first 20-30 minutes of this movie was incredibly boring, I thought that maybe it was just to make us get to know the characters so I gave it some more time. Then after an hour had passed I realized that this wasn't going to get any better. (somehow the same feeling the characters have about their own lives in the movie) It seems like the moviemakers didn't want to make a movie, they wanted to make a masterpiece. It's like the movie is saying "hey look at me, have u seen anything better?!? Look at these cool camera-angles and these amazing close-ups. And I don't only look good I'm deep too." Anyway I don't buy it. Just because you show close-ups of an eye and pills thrown into mouths it's not automatically a great movie. I'm not impressed. Anyway I've noticed that with IMDB the newer the movie is the higher ratings it gets. If you want to see a movie about drugadiction watch "panic in needle park" or the german movie "christiane f" both those movies are far better than this one (and rated lower). I don't hate this movie but I can't for my life understand how so many people can love it. I'm giving this a 1. That might be unfair but it's just as unfair as the 8.5 that it has on here. If I see it again I sure hope I discover something new since it feels like I'm the only one in the world who's not impressed with this. Over 40% voted a 10 for this.


                
The real descent into the quagmire is the last 30 minutes of this film, not the characters within the film. According to this film this is what you can expect from drug abuse: 1. Being force-fed in a public hospital (have these people heard of the IV drip?) and then ECT without any form of anaethesia (every bone in that woman's body would have shattered)- did they take her to a hospital in Eastern Europe?? 2. People with severe septicaemia will be denied hospital treatment and thrown into a cell on suspicion of being a drug addict until they require amputation.  Watch and learn - it's fine to be a junkie as long as you don't get caught. 3. A man will be allowed to vomit into food being prepared in a government run correction facility. If you are bad, you eat vomit. OK? 4. A middle class chick will end up on the other end of a black dildo in order to feed her drug habit. Yawn... I mean, this film says more about what kind of overblown morality Americans are willing to accept in films than anything about drug abuse or its consequences. The anti-drug message descends into hyperbole and farce and I found myself laughing hysterically where I was supposed to be shocked and repulsed. Give me a break. These sanitised stories are just too ridiculous.  As well as this, we are offered the same old, same old routine of white-powder-imagery and colourful-pill-popping. These guys injected something and were bopping around the place, next minute they snort something and they are all on the nod...go figure? And please, the heavy handedness of the junkie losing an arm...spare me, I am not that easily shocked or unaware of symbolism-overkill.


                
This movie struck me as utterly phony, which was surprising as Aronfsky's prior film, "Pi," was amazing. Never once, from the very beginning, did I believe I was watching anything but specific actors play-acting. Ellen Burtsyn's thick slice of ham cut close to the bone was embarrassing, and her New York "Jewish" accent coming in a film released in the year 2000 struck me as outrageous! I mean, are we going back to "The Goldbergs" and 1950?
The whole film struck me as ersatz, artificial -- it had this 1950 junkie sensibility of Selby grafted onto this "hip hop" style that was simply jarring. The screenplay, which was co-written with Selby, was so predictable I began amusing the woman I was watching the film with by actually giving her the next line. I was right too often for comfort. The massacre during the dope dealing sequence in the back of the supermarket not only was telegraphed far ahead, but was incredibly STUPID. I did not believe the scene for a minute. Is it supposed to be a dream? I ask that as it has NO LOGIC.Perhaps the biggest problem were the two leads -- Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. While their acting was quite good, they looked like they had deplaned at JFK from Beverly Hills that very morning. Connelly is too good looking for the role (she does not look the part of a junkie; in contrast, Samantha Morton, who granted is a better actress, looks the part of a junkie in "Jesus's Son"); a woman that looks like Connelly could be a call girl making many thousands of dollars a night, which made her "descent" into hell ridiculous. What is the problem with her character: she's just plain stupid?
Leto looks like a male model. (There used to be an old joke when I was a kid: Funny, it don't look Jewish. Leto, whose character I assume is at least half Jewish, looks as pure Irish as Connelly; in fact, they look enough alike to be brother and sister, which I'm sure was intentional but which was downright weird.)The ending, the denouement of the three main characters' stories, was so over-the-top that my friend and I began laughing out loud. (I will say, Burstyn was excellent during the harrowing scene of the force feeding. The look on her face of pain, humiliation and resignation was haunting -- a great moment in screen acting.) Just intercutting two of the stories, son and mother, would have been enough, but the sexual imagery and situation of Connelly's character was so evocative of a throwing everything in but the kitchen sink mentality, we just couldn't stop howling. I mean -- COME ON! I'm chuckling right now thinking of the scene. It certainly dissipated the power of the son's horror (though not that of Burstyn, due to the great control she displayed in her acting; perhaps Aronfsky should learn the value of SUBTLTY from that part of her performance).I think people were wowed by the directoral pyrotechnics, but frankly, this film's triumph of form over substance ranks as audience abuse!


                
Remember the anti-drug commercial where a girl points to an egg, says, "this is your brain," and then screams, "this is your brain on drugs!" as she smashes the egg with a skillet and proceeds to demolish the entire kitchen, screaming, "and this is what drugs do to your family, this is what they do to your future..." and so on?If you can imagine that commercial going on for two hours, done with great visual style and editing, with acting that ranges from excellent (Ellen Burstyn) to terrible, you can skip this movie. While Requiem for a Dream sells itself as an important movie about important subject matter, it does nothing to explain why REAL PEOPLE do drugs. Its characters are not people. They suffer without reflection on their own states, while the filmmaker attempts to bombard you with visual symbols explaining what they want and feel. While one could interpret the device used to explain why the Burstyn character continues her downward spiral, the game show, as a meaningful symbol for individuals' desires for acceptance and recognition, I don't think it is one. It is a gimmick that condescends to the character by making her desire for acceptance pathetic and silly. The movie tells you what to think about her inner motivations by staging them in a highly subjective way.This way of revealing character is consistent throughout the movie. Characters are without interior lives, or at least their interior lives are not revealed. At the same time, the movie uses symbols (the game show, the television, etc...) to suggest the reasons for their desires. While real people do drugs for complex reasons which are hard to unravel, these characters are living in a movie-world symbolism which suggests familiar, "important" reasons for their behavior that tie into the most materialistic, shallow aspects of our society. And of course the shallow, cheap aspects of our culture are harmful to us all, and we recognize them in the movie. So despite their lack of depth, is not hard for us to relate to these characters, and maybe even feel sorry for them, since they exist only as empty vessels into which we may pour our own self-pity.


                
You know, the problem with this flick is that the director is really good, the actors are really good, but the plot is just too stinking far fetched. I mean, come on, a little girl on girl sex is NOT something to get really upset about. I mean, working in an office for a living is a LOT worse than that. There are literally thousands of women who do that sorta thing for a living.And then there's the problem with the guy and his arm. First problem with that is that no junkie, NO JUNKIE, would keep shooting into a vein that is that messed up. Junkies are not that stupid. They have their own lore and protocols, that they pass to each other, and that includes using different veins. Aronofsky obviously has never met a real life junkie. And that crap about getting arrested out of a doctors office. ANYWHERE in this country, if a doctor refused him medical treatment, dang, even if a doctor called the cops on the guy, that doctor would get his ass sued from here to eternity. There's something called doctor patient privilege, they're not ALLOWED to call the cops, ever, under any circumstances, barring a direct threat to someone else's life. AND if the was imprisoned, denied treatment, and then lost his arm, attorney's would be lining up to sue not only the doctor, but the state where he was imprisoned.SO, even if the the incredibly unlikely event that the junkie let his arm go that bad, then the astronomically unlikely event that a doctor would risk being sued and losing his license to practice medicine by calling the cops, and THEN the cosmically ludicrous event that the guy would be denied medical treatment by the prison, he would STILL have lawyers lining up for the fat 50% fee they'd get from suing all those people.The movie is about as tragic as if they'd all somehow won the lottery and then been struck by lightening the following day.Requim for a Dream is not depressing, it's laughable.
Following up his pseudo-intellectual claptrap "Pi", Aronofsky gives us another example of his inability to direct anything other than an hour and a half long music video. And a poor one at that. Any comparisons to "A Clockwork Orange" are completely off the mark. While I'm no fan of that movie, either, I'll admit that Kubrick had talent.Basically, rather like some other inexplicably popular movies, such as "Boogie Nights", this movie is akin to being stuck in a room full of crackheads for two hours, and we're supposed to find it not only interesting, but tragic. Sorry, but no go. I care not one whit for any of the characters in this movie, and wish they'd all just go away.For me, this is the filmic equivalent of one of those books you get so mad at, that you just want to throw it across the room.


                
I cannot believe the high ratings this movie has gotten. This is one of the most superficial and one-dimensional films I have ever seen. I grant you that Ellen Burstyn did a fine job, but what about the rest of the story? It seemed to me to be something Nancy Reagan might have written and produced. The seeming demise of Harry and Marion at the end showed how little the actors and Aronofsky know about the descent into drug addiction.What was really disappointing was that although Aronofsky demonstrated interesting techniques in "Pi," he never really developed them in this film.
I don't understand why everyone was so deeply affected by this film.


                
While the trailer for this movie was seductive, most notably for its MTV-style quick shots from the film & music, actually watching it was an experience in torture.  This film is one big cliche. Perhaps US raver kids (born after 1980) who have never seen a good film might find this to be "different" & "unusual", but for anyone that's seen non-US or pre-1980 films, this film is one big bore. It's presentation of drug use is no more complex or realistic than the "This is your brain on drugs" PSAs that graced US television sets more than a decade ago. If you're into stream-of-consciousness & lots of style in your drug film check out  "Naked Lunch", If you're into the drama & humor of it all then check out "Trainspotting", or if you need a dose of pessimism & reality then check out "Drugstore Cowboy". Hell, even "Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas" is better than this mess. The acting is awful, especially Ellen Burstyn.  I was never convinced that her over-the-top performance was anything but acting....if you really want to see a food performance from her check out "The Last Picture Show".   What irks me most about the film is that its MTV-style quick cuts & soundtrack really mask the fact that there is really nothing to it.   I could have spent the 90 or so minutes I wasted watching it doing something more productive...like my laundry. By far the most boring drug movie I have ever seen.  Advisory: take some caffeine or amphetamines first if you want to stay awake to the ending.


                
Yet another highly praised "hard hitting" film that turns out to be quite frankly rubbish. Clever editing can't disguise the fact that this turns out to be little more than "Reefer Madness" in fashionable clothes. As inaccurate about the drug milieu as it is about psychiatry (ECT is done on anaethetized subjects - but obviously that does not film as well). Abysmally written and acted - Ellen Burstyns performance is straight out of a 40's b-movie. Immature and flashy - which probably explains the quite ridiculous IMDB grading.


                
If you subscribe to the masochistic belief that great art must be painful, then by all means, see Requiem for a Dream. If, on the other hand, you'd rather not spend 2 hours having Aronofsky pick at you like a scab, skip it. The director's intention is clearly to upset you, give you a headache, and instill in you a hatred of addictive behavior. He succeeds marvelously.Wayans, in the closing sequence of the film, vomits into a bucket of some white viscous somethingorother he's stirring.That about sums up my reaction to Requiem for a Dream.


                
I rented this movie yesterday based on the resounding and overwhelming appreciation it received from IMDB voters. I have to say that it did not live up to its billing. Everyone who commented on the movie has said it is "powerful" and "unique". I feel that the movie was very "obvious". The movie continually tried to showcase the dangers of drugs and abuse of drugs. They do not do this successfully however, because they go to these incredibly stupid extremes that are so overdone and unnecessary that it became disgusting to watch and no longer plausible or even believable. Anyone that truly liked this movie based on its content has serious problems. I knew exactly what was going to happen before it did. People who have drug addictions may  go to great lengths to obtain the drugs but COME ON! The people in the film start acting like they are possessed by the devil himself and the end result of their drug addiction is the worst possible situation. I mean the WORST possible situation. The movie is not accurate nor is it appropriate. Stupid really. Thats all from Big V. 3/10.


                
I'll never understand why so many reasonable people think so highly of this movie. It contains some of the worst dialogue ever written -- every sentence ends with a period and the speech has no flow or rhythm. The plot is so outlandish, it is more like Reefer Madness than real life. Darren Aronofsky directs movies for high school kids to watch and think that they are the only people smart enough to "get it."This movie is more of a public service announcement than an artistic endeavor, and the message of the film is one that every American kid learned in D.A.R.E -- Drugs are bad. If you want to watch something about addiction, watch the Wire or read Infinite Jest, but whatever you do don't waste your time watching this movie.
This is a movie made by someone who was never in the game, and written by someone who has been out of it for years. There is nothing remotely truthful about this movie. The people who think that it is - don't know the first thing about drug addiction. It does have one thing in common with a drug addict, though. It is repetitive and boring. I was really looking forward to this film. I loved PI. I just hope Aronofsky isn't a one shot wonder.


                
Hollywood's gratuitous attempt at an anti-drug message showcases an array of characters (you're bound to relate to one of them) in a this-is-your-brain, this-is-your-brain-on-drugs kind of way. You watch it and think, hey if I was and so-and-so, my-brain-not-on-drugs was the way to go!However, if you have any remote sense of logic, then you don't actually have to endure the film to figure that out.There's a gritty, depersonalizing element to the film which adds style and extreme worst-case-scenario scares, but overall, it's got that afterschool special obviousness - drugs are bad!When it's over, you expect the guy with the eggs and frying pan to lurch out and say, "Any questions?"
Requiem for a Dream is a movie that has its heart in the right place, but not much else.  Much has been made of the technical aspects of this film. And some of the technique does impress.  The rampant use of split screen very effectively, quickly, and cleverly underscores the selfishness of characters.  They are literally separated from one another within the film frame.  The repetition of certain elements--the rapid fire images that accompany every hit of heroin taken by the characters--is cool.  Less cool are these crazy point of view shots, lots of odd angles.  Why are they there?  They do not enhance the film in any way.  They are as pretentious and unnecessary as any technical thing in film this year.The other thing about this movie is that I didn't care about most of it. Jared Leto Marlon Wayans and the girlfriend--sorry, can't remember her name--go through all these horrible things.  And we're supposed to sympathize, feel their pain.  Oh, look what drugs have done to those poor creatures.  But look:  these people are junkies and dealers, spoiled brats doing their own thing and paying the price.  As callous as it may seem to say this, they deserve what they get.  But look, here's the other thing. Aronofsky is so heavy handed and obvious about one fact--that these characters WILL BE PUNISHED--that it becomes almost laughable.  I mean, these are cliches that even most hacks would steer clear of.  Simplistic, naive, are the words I would use to describe Mr. Aronofsky's take on this whole thing.He goes so far over the top--and he does this in the other main storyline, involving Ellen Burstyn--that he undercuts the potential power of his own piece.  It becomes a movie of bombast, a trite piece of audience manipulation.  Look at what drugs have done to this person and that person. I love that Aronofsky tried to make a really powerful anti-drug movie. But I hate how incredibly he failed.


                
A wallowing in a false underbelly. Ellen Burstyn's one-note shrieking, Jared Leto's awful accent - it's fake and annoying. This movie rode a wave of bs hype. I love it when people claim it's authentic. There's nothing authentic about it. It's all surface. And people fell for it. It's a fake, an emperor with no clothes. Stuttering muttering and yelling, nothing happens but actors chewing scenery and a once-talented director indulging masturbatory fantasies. There's no there there. If drug abuse was merely an irritant, this film would have some small merit. But it's a problem with more depth than the filmmaker acknowledged. The director went off the rails for this overrated waste of time.


                
The cinematography was great. This film was beautiful to watch from a technical standpoint. There were really only one or two things I'd change (Those annoying split-screens!), and I really loved film speed was played with.The acting was wonderful on all parts (Even Marlon Wayans, shock of all shocks!)And I want to marry the score.But I absolutely hated the movie. Why? Because I've never felt so emotionally manipulated in my life.


                
Firstly, as an anti-drugs film this is flawed, because the characters come across as being generally dislikeable regardless. Secondly, instead of pier-pressure or anything like that, these people chose to become drug addicts.Apart from the drug related messages in this film there's nothing of interest, there's no dialogue, no humour, nothing. This film is void of anything remotely intriguing.Whether intentional or not: the TV show kept releasing more information throughout, but never completed itself. This alone made the film fall flat, because too much effort was put into a segment that was left unfinished and pointless. Unless there's some message about life being a TV show and dying early through drugs means you will never get to see the end (yes I'm reaching).My point is this: with this type of anti-entertainment film the only point in watching it is the messages and guidance it may contain within, but this film doesn't contain anything. It's just a crap story about crap characters that the writer decided he wasn't going to end properly.If you want an anti-drugs film that gets the message across far better, and actually is entertaining then check out Trainspotting. I get the impression from this film that this is an attempt at a `cleverer' Americanised remake, obviously the writer of Requiem For a Dream missed the point entirely.Pure rubbish - 1/10


                
This is truly the most tedious, boring, trite, contrived and uninspired film I have ever had the misfortune to sit through.  It was so boring that I wanted to walk out of the cinema after the first hour.  My companion almost fell asleep. I felt nothing for the characters, who were not really established as rounded, believable people. Some of the visual tricks were repeated constantly and lost all novelty or interest after the first hour. At that point the direction of the plot also became utterly predictable and it just felt so horrendously repetitious. I felt like getting up and shouting at the screen "Die, junkie! Die! Die! I want to get out of here! ", but I didn't want to disturb the other patrons.***SLIGHT SPOILER *** I was also very offended at the way ECT Treatment was shown in the film.  The participant was fully awake.  Now I don't know about the U.S, but people are generally knocked out when they receive this treatment in the U.K., and have been for at least 20 years (I know someone who has had the treatment).  This is treatment of last resort for people who don't respond to any other kind of treatment. It is not perfect and can have unfortunate side effects, but has saved a lot of people from the slough of despond or even suicide. This was the last straw in destroying any limited respect I might have had for the director. He is just a purveyor of sensationalist claptrap masquerading as deep social comment. *****SPOILER ENDS****.I don't care that it had a worthy theme - addictions are bad and can destroy your life. The theme has been trawled over so many times that we don't need another attempt, especially one as bad as this. Though it might shock and offend the very sensitive, it didn't shock me.  I didn't seem real for even a moment. If anything the visual tricks were wasted, because they just had a distancing effect. All in all, I can honestly say this is the worst film I have ever seen.
I don't really think this is a one-star movie, but there is no way this movie should be rated #34 in the all-time list.  Sorry.Drugs bad. Prescription drugs are drugs. TV is a drug. Pretty people and stylized techniques make a good movie.Cool. It's like a drug. Ironic.Actually it's kinda neat.  It's emptiness and all. But don't think it's an all-time great movie.  Really it deserves 4.9. Or 5.1.  No 4.9.  Like a cigarette, almost enough to satisfy.


                
Another drug film, just this one is a little more extreme than the other ones.  No new ground is really covered...lifeless characters do drugs, do some more drugs, become more unhappy then get into some serious trouble, and the movie gets great reviews. It's the blueprint to critical success.


                
Requiem for a Dream is the worst movie I've seen in a long while. Whether is was the immature score of the film (which left me bored), the overdone subject matter and obvious themes, or the shameful, explicit sex scenes, I do not know. But the movie, just overall, didn't seem to be anything more than an attempt by a director to trick people into thinking his movie is innovative. Apparently, as far as the public is concerned, he succeeded.
