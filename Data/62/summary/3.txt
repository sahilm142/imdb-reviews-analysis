 Very Disappointing

 Django (Drag-O) Unchained - Viewer Chained

 Tarantino was over in the 90's

 Gorefest with no real purpose

 Seeing the ratings I hoped it was a better movie

 Tarantino has lost his mojo

 Inglorious Basterds - Cowboy style

 Long, ridiculous, gratuitous violence, not funny in the least

 Expectedly disappointed in unexpected ways

 Boring Unimpressive and Uninspiring

 Too Much!

 What's the fuzz about this boring piece?

 Good start, ridiculous ending

 The Epic Downfall of an Epic Director

 R U Kiddin' Me?

 worst Tarantino ever, boring

 I walked out.

 too long

 Another crap movie after Inglorious Bastards.

 Splitter splatter

 Just Plain Offensive!

 Good story, good settings, great actors, spoiled by cruelty.

 Classic Tarantino, with little charm or wit

 This movie was given too much attention and credit in advance

 another Tarantino revenge fantasy - boring!
