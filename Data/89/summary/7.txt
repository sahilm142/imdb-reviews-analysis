 The milky bar kid

 The work of an Evil Genius

 A Clockwork Lemon?

 British social satire imagining what society could be ....

 A fusion of violence, humor, and classical music was original in 1971 and still entertains

 The best Kubrick work I've seen so far

 It Disappoints me...

 Stanley Kubrick's satire on crime and justice is just shy of being a great movie. It's perverse and provoking, but there's also mad genius beneath its repulsive content

 Fascinating politics

 "I was cured, all right."

 Bizarre Sci-Fi-Drama!

 My Review

 Eyelashes and Deception

 amazing...

 This is the best movie ever made

 Dated

 A Clockwork Orange

 Disturbingly good, but a bit "overplayed"

 Weak Story cannot expect more

 Good But Overrated

 Good movie -- as a result of the brilliant source material

 An interesting movie

 about the movie: Clockwork Orange

 Clockwork Orange is not about violence, or even the future. When the movie begins, it's about the past. 'Alex' representing Britain of the past.

 Bizarre, but thoughtful film
