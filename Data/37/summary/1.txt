 BORING and ARTIFICIAL. The emperor has no clothes.

 Overrated, formulaic romance

 Am I missing something?

 "Here's not looking at you, kid".

 Hilarious

 The most overrated film of all time

 this is simply the most overrated movie in American history.

 Best Movie Ever Made for Old, Balding Males and Housewives!

 VERY overrated

 Looks like the story was written by a six year old

 Too saccharine for me.

 Bergman. Bogart. As Time Goes By. Word: Priceless

 This movie SUCKED

 One of those movies that every movie-fan must see once in his lifetime
