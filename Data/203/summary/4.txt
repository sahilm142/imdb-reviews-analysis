 Absolutely tedious

 The most overrated movie I've ever seen

 Talk, talk, more talk, and then some talking

 Dreadful dialog

 Overrated, flat.

 A highly disappointing attempt at movie making!

 Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?

 well, coming from the director of Dazed and Confuse, what would you expect?
