 Reefer Madness for the MTV generation...

 Apparently, making sense is optional if you have a split screen.

 Pretentious and overrated

 The triumph of form over substance ranks as audience abuse

 Over-rated morality tale

 Requiem for your self-respect

 A complete waste of time disguised as "art"

 Laughable melodrama

 Don't believe the tripe!

 Did Project D.A.R.E. sponsor this crap?

 One of the most awful movies ever

 Absolutely one of the most overrated films of all time

 Made by someone who was never in the game

 To the absolute extreme

 The ultimate "art as pain" movie.

 R-Rated Afterschool Special

 What a terrible waste of film

 Supposedly good...

 So overrated. Not authentic. Shallow.

 DIE, JUNKIE! DIE! DIE!

 Twice as pointless as Magnolia and half as entertaining

 Eyesore and Headache.

 Protest vote. Ironically like a drug.

 ugh
