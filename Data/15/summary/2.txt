 boring

 More Bored of the Rings

 walking and more walking

 Sophomoric drivel with excellent special effects

 ...Partially...entertaining

 Goofy, not Good

 Shame after FOTR

 Terrible...

 The Best Film Of 2002

 testing.. testing.. Is this thing on?

 Adapation Unreprehensible, Cinematically o.k. (SPOILERS)

 More of the Same

 Confirmed: we'll kill your dream story

 Just a lot of walking really...

 Overrated.

 The Ultimate in Action-Packed Disappointment

 Weak

 long, too long, fell asleep

 i'm horrified...

 The only words I can say about this movie....

 Walking

 Marginally better than the first one!

 Disgusting

 Boring, Slow, Unnecessary

 Lordy! Lordy! Lordy! This one is also awful!
