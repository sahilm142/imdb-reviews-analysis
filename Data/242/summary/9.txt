 A deeply personal motion picture...

 Please Make It All Right

 The Troops are Coming Home.....

 A great film standing timeless

 well written, acted, designed, directed, shot, edited and scored

 Full of emotion, but not drama

 How war veterans never get rid of their wars but have to live with them anyway.

 Must See Movie

 War Veterans Return Home

 A supremely likable drama, yet worthy of deeper reflection...

 "They couldn't train him to put his arms around his girl, or to stroke her hair"

 A Film of Rare Breed

 A Best Picture of My Life

 They don't make 'em much better than this.

 Not at all what I expected

 "Last year it was killing Japs and this year it's... make money."

 A fine slice of post-WWII life

 One of the best movies ever!

 Good call for the AFI

 The struggles of three American servicemen returning from WWII.

 My rating: 9

 Classic Academy-Award Winner.

 Profound and Heartbreaking

 A tribute to the victorious dead and the wounded, enervated, and venerated survivors

 Classic post-war epic.
