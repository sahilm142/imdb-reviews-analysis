 Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.

 Christopher Nolan is genius

 Not a movie i could get into.

 Very entertaining, but NOT some influential masterpiece!

 Give him the kick

 Better than average 'Dream Gimmick' movie

 Amazingly original...but also a bit overwhelming.

 a complex looking movie with a simple concept underneath

 This movie blew my mind on so many levels

 I thought it was overdone.

 Is this a very entertaining movie? YES!! Is this a masterpiece? Nooooooo!

 Nolan's magnum opus ;the fulfillment of a decade's vision

 Nolan's first soap opera

 I'm sorry to say this is not as 'great' a film as they think

 Nothing New In This Dreamworld

 A Mutli-Layered Dream World

 Inception or Deception?

 Hole in the plot of Inception

 An energetic and complex sci-thriller that redefines the saying 'How deep does the rabbit hole go?'

 Not as great as all the hype but an entertaining film to say the least

 a classic

 "Take a leap of faith" - not hard to do here

 Nolan has created a provocative piece of cinema, flirting with masterpiece -- but is it?

 What a movie it was..!! Nolan hats off to you..

 A fun idea for a flight of fantasy
