 Hardly watchable to fans who enjoyed the intelligence and wit of Season One.

 Good looking cliché's bore me to death

 Are you having a laugh?

 What the hell?

 Stupid program trying to be intellectually clever but failing as the writers themselves aren't at that level.

 Disappointing season 5

 Unbelievable premise and disappointing characters

 Major spoiler and rant

 I'm Done

 SUITS: a great tv show to a rubbish tv show

 Soap opera

 Season 8 is a Big Disappointment

 I think they delibrately killed this show.
