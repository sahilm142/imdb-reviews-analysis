This show is surgically executed. It builds and builds and when you least expect erupts like a violent volcano. I warn you it can be bloody and violent but that's the shock of it because you don't see it coming. Just when you think it's become stable BOOM. THIS is the best prison show hands down. The casting and acting is out of this world. Each of the seasons finales are staggering. I've watched all 3 seasons and each is a prize waiting to behold. This series is brilliant. The way the lead has grown and transgressed is so awesome. I love this show. Orange is the new black I can't even watch after I first saw this. It literally changed the game. You don't understand how much of a favor you'd be doing your self by watching this incredible show. Bravo
