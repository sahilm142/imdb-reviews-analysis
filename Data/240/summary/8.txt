 A Fantastic Film from THE Hayao Miyazaki

 Amazing

 Impressive, but not a masterpiece

 One of the best and most successful early anime films.

 Maybe too 'typical' of Miyazaki's work to be appreciated on its 'atypical' level...

 A really enjoyable adventure movie!

 This Japanese animated tale of adventure, danger and magic actually happens to be a bit better than average; a rousing and exciting film.

 Another creation from Miyazaki that will live on forever

 A wonderfully imaginative and action-packed animated adventure

 A few rough edges but still a magical film from Miyazaki

 Quick and Short mini-review

 A girl just fell from the sky, boss

 Great film

 I liked this when entertainment value was all that mattered.

 A fantastic story, with smashing visuals.

 Doesn't the title give away that it does exist...?
