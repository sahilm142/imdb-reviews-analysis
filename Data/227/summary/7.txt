 Quirky film that's wide open to interpretation

 A good film, with a fervent cult following, but it shoots short of greatness

 far away from a perfect ten

 Original but difficult movie.

 Good acting and great premise fall prey to poor execution and resolution

 "It's meant to be ironic..."

 slightly overrated

 I Still Don't Get It

 opinions in the extreme (spoilers within)

 Boy named Donnie gets a mysterious message from a creepy bunny and tries to figure out what it all means.

 Ambiguity does not equal genius

 Food for thought.

 A head trip

 Mind-numbingly bizarre

 Completely Different

 Teens Movie

 Donnie Darko Prequel

 One rabbit of the apocalypse

 Not Bad, Almost great.

 Bizarre doesn't always mean compelling

 Falls short of a complete success

 full of sound and fury, signifying nothing

 So close to getting the whole picture yet so far away

 Over Rated

 Very Effective
