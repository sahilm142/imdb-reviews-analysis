 Nicely shot (no pun intended) at times but surprisingly dull

 Nowhere near the level of the Dollars trilogy

 lumbering and interminable

 A long, long, long movie

 Ridiculously overrated, classic style over substance, Cartoon Western

 Spaghetti Trash!

 Overhyped Oldie

 Once Upon a Time in the West

 Jason Robards destroys this movie.

 I saw the restored 4.5 version........Slow as molasses.
