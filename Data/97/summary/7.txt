 Touching but Overpraised

 Decent but not remarkable

 Best film?

 Good, but overrated

 Bitter tale & beautiful depiction

 Unforgettable, grim depiction of the unfairness of life

 Father and son

 Much better than I ever imagined

 Wonderful in so many ways .. BUT!

 Powerful film in many ways

 An educational experience rather than an entertaining one,

 Salvation on a bike

 Great themes, just a pity about some of the sub-plots

 A real play on emotions

 The great buildup to the moral question

 I don't get it.

 Italian economic crisis

 A Curiously Memorable Film

 A good film, sad but good

 Excellent as a short film not a long film

 Simple but compassionate
