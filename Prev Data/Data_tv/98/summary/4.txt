 Decent show, but insanely overrated

 Cheap television, not really that great over all.

 Watched this season with heavy use of fast forward. Writers Room, don't be "Enterprise".

 Not great,but kind bad

 It had so much potential..

 Wheres the action??

 Tediously slow.

 daredevil's powers: superhuman smell, superhuman hearing and getting his ass kicked

 What a disappointment

 A revival of the old school cult movies into a 2015 TV-Series

 The Punisher Saved this Series or it would be a 1

 Script & dialogue are silly.

 Skip season 3 only to remain a fan of this series

 Daredevil or who knows!!!

 Hmm overrated?
