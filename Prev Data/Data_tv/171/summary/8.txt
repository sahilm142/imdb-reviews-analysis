 Two Ratings - 8/10 for S01~03, 3/10 for S04~05

 An Awesome show died when Ragnar Lothbrok died

 Seasons 1-3 are a must see, the rest not so much

 Lost it's Way

 Delighted and eager to see how the show matures

 Looks like a good voyage for History Channel's VIKINGS

 Vikings Seasons 1-4A

 Well-done adventure saga following the exploits of a group of Vikings led by Ragnar

 was a 10 now it's an 8

 I love the show but hate the feminist propaganda

 As the World Turns

 Too Hollywood

 Quite good

 One of my favorite shows

 Pretty good but has major flaws.

 Overall a great TV series

 Interesting show, not real history...

 A Show I Am Proud Of!

 Capitalism at it's best!

 Great, intriguing show as far as the first 2-3 season go, later seasons a downright disappointment!

 Very good. Not great, but very good.

 History Alive!

 Kirk Douglas would love it.

 Vikings is a must to watch if you enjoy the Viking era...

 Oddly, I was entertained...
