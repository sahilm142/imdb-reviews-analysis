 Major Letdown

 Overrated

 Definitely overrated

 Hyped movie with little substance

 Deeply Disappointed

 Disjointed, Unappealing Flick (Quasi-Spoiler)

 An excuse for gore

 A Few Good Ideas

 Definitely Not Flawless

 Reservoir dogs? More like Stupid Puppies.

 Very Overrated...

 Flying curses instead of bullets or chilling suspense.

 An overly violent movie that builds up to an unsatisfying ending

 Realistic, but very thin story and stupid characters

 Realistic like hell. But reality sometimes may be it.

 Overrated and Over-hyped like Pulp Fiction. Pointless movie.

 The cuss-oriented squabbles of lowlife crooks for 99 minutes (and no women)

 All dogs don't go to heaven

 4/10 Film contains no dogs

 Doesn't deserve the high ratings

 very good first movie

 Had the Potential to be Great

 either the world is wiser then me or i m the Einstien of today!
