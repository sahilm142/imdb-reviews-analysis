1/10The idea was way too simple, just an angry and ruthless shark swimming around and eating defenceless people. When I was 6 I was really scared of it, bloody water and all those documentaries about sharks attacking people. But now I grew up and probably also grew out of flicks like this. It isn't even so funny now. It's just dull, boring and unwatchable.I don't know how a thinking person call it "the best horror". It's just a clichéd thriller with some major flaws.Watch Alien - it's a true horror.


                
i have waited this long so that i could see the film again and see if it was as bad as i remembered it. it was far worse, one of the most boring films ever made. as with most Spielberg films the "heroes2 or protagonist's are all pretty stupid, there were a million ways to kill of the shark, but they chose the most cumbersome and dangerous. i remember when i first saw it, first being utterly bored most of the time when nothing happens and we get scene after scene of crap dialogue and stories from not very interesting characters, then the shark appears and its so bad its like pantomime which in England is kids musical comedy with over the top and not well made props. it was so obviously not in the least bit real and even less scary. why people keep rating this film that has no scares or tension in it is beyond me. its like the Beatles myth, as the greatest band in the world it just keeps perpetuating, same as Spielberg being the greatest director of all time when in my view he is not even in the top 100
I really hated this movie. I'm sorry I know I am definitely in the minority here, but I have to be honest and I really don't see what so many people see in this movie. Maybe it's because I only just saw this now and movies get worse over time? I know my mom and dad liked the movie and actually thought it was scary, but I just thought the whole thing was boring. OK so there's this shark and it's huge and it's terrorizing a beach community in New York. Great, so that should be scary except we never really see the shark (I know people will say that's what is scary is that we don't even see it especially for the first attack and that's supposed to somehow make it more terrifying, but the truth is they just couldn't get the shark to work so they shot around it, and I found it to be about a zero out of ten on the scary scale), and then when we do finally see the shark it's a total joke! It looks so incredibly fake and moves around almost not at all and looks very awkward and unreal. The only part that was cool at all was the captain fighting the shark to the bitter end. Richard Dreyfuss hiding at the bottom of the ocean from the shark was also stupid, just so they could avoid the sadness of seeing him die? Dumb. I read the book and it was great but this movie is just boring. Very predictable ending too with how they took out the shark.
***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Everybody I know likes this movie, and they all say that it is a classic. Please, this movie is so boring. The movie is supposed to be about the shark, right, and we hardly see any of it, and my brother told me that the reason for that is, that it is supposed to add to the suspense. What suspense? Before Alex gets killed, we see a bunch of kids playing with a fake fin, and there is no music. Then we hear John Williams music, and we see some of the actual shark, and then we see the Alex's leg, and you know the shark is going to kill him, so where is the suspense. There is no suspense at all, you know the shark is going in for the kill, so it's just a matter of seeing him die. The movie is very boring, and the 3 main characters give nothing to liven up the very dull, and simple plot for a " classic.'' I know that in movies your suposed to have character devolpment, but in this movie there is too much of it. Instead of showing the shark, they show them dirnking wine, and eating dinner, and there is no point to it. They could be showing something more important to the already THIN plot, but no, instead they show people eating, and drinking.Through out the whole movie Speilberg hides the shark, and in the end, you see it's face. It's more like an unveiling, and of course we a regular shark, nothing to go WOW over, just a regular shark. Come on, people no what sharks look like, so why hid it the whole movie. The last 50 minutes of the film is nothing fancy, it's not even entertaning, it's just a matter of finding the shark, and killing it. Then we find out that they didn't know how big the shark was, and how stupid is that, and they didn't even pick a big enough boat, are they really that stupid. I also did not like the ending, I thought they could have though of something more complicated. Brody throws the air tank at the ahrk, and it happens to land in the perfect place for him to shoot. Well I just plain hated this movie, it far, far, far from a classic and even further from being a godd movie. It's nor scary, or entertaining, and Robert Shaw thinks that he knows everything about sharks, and that's the arrognace that kills him. 0/0, 1/10, thumbs way way way down, well you get the picture.
No, I am not crazy. Jaws shouldn't be on the top 250 list because it is just about as good as a rotten fish sandwich! Jaws bites you in the butt with the jaws of boredom, not the jaws of life. For one thing, it's not scary. It's just really gross, like with all the blood in the water. And that bloody corpse underwater. This film has to much blood to be rated PG today. It would be PG-13 or even R today. Another thing that makes this film crappy is that it is completely unimaginative served with a side of boredom. If you still want a will to stay in the water, avoid at all costs. Trust me, you have better things to do than watching people get murdered by a stinky cheese shark!!! I don't even know why so many people like it. Trust me, it's totally not worth it.


                
Just a waste of time....very dated and bad effects... how can you be positive about a film like this...??? Even in the time of release , i never understood how people can be thrilled about it... To resume , i can only say that it is one of the worst films ever made.... Nevertheless , the key roles have decent acting for that time. The shark is a monster that are visible by !) miles , that it is made of bad plastic...:-) Also the reactions and bites are poor and clumsy... The soundtrack is monotone but very recognizable... and that is the strongest point of the whole film...For me , it is a complete riddle why these film is in the top250


                
Dreyfuss can't act his way out of a soggy paper sack. Spielberg started out cheesy and never lost his knack. One of the worst uses of celluloid and time ever.They said I can't submit this review without ten lines of text. There isn't ten lines of text that is worthy of use on this flick. Don't waste your time unless you want to see a farce with a fake rubber fish with foam skin. No plot, totally predictable.The only saving grace is Roy Scheider. He is totally wasted in this, but his five minutes on-screen blunts the pain of the rest of the movie.


                
worst story, paper-thin plot, worst effects, worst music. I can't understand why more than 25% of the votes on this movie votes a 10.... few options; they are all liars, or don't know anything about quality-motion-pictures...


                
I've seen some terrible movies in my time but this one really takes the prize as one of the worst.  As for suspense, I'm more scared by Monsters Inc and the shark is so fake and unrealistic its pathetic.  At least Deep Blue Sea had sharks that looked real and could actually install some element of fear in the viewer.  And the actors looked as embarrassed starring in the film as I was watching it.


                
Shark plays tag-team with three guys before blowing up. Mneh. Doesn't sound too special, does it? It shouldn't, because it's not."Jaws" (1975) is considered by many to be Spielbergs bonafide classic. That's giving Spielberg a bad name. With titles like "Schindler's List," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," and "Saving Private Ryan" under his belt, he's certainly a respectable filmmaker. "Jaws", however, isn't a particularly respectable movie.In fact, it's terrible. NOTHING HAPPENS. Shark attacks. Yeah. Mneh. People panic. Shark attacks again. Whoo hoo. Exhilaratin', really.Come on, people, don't hail this as a bonafide classic. You want a classic? Watch "The Conversation." "The Godfather." "Psycho." "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." "M." "Chinatown." "All the President's Men." "Laura." Even watch a modern classic like "Fargo," "The Usual Suspects," or "The Shawshank Redemption." But please. Stay away from this boring travesty of a movie.I hate to diss popular films. But some flicks are just plain over-rated.JAWS: * (out of Five)
Wake me up when this film gets interesting.  All the talk about this film made me watch it for the first time.  I only made it half-way before literally falling asleep.  Sharks aren't frightening if you have enough sense to stay out of the water, plus the negative stereotypes perpetuated by this film probably killed more sharks than can be imagined.  A predator is a predator, nature needs them films probably don't though.


                
This movie is absolutely boring.  The shark in the movie is as twice as big as a normal shark and he's so smart.  Spielberg is one of the worst directors ever.  The shark gets out of traps.  To tell you the truth, I haven't seen the whole movie in a long time, but from what I remeber it's boring.  Very bad acting.  Don't watch it.


                
The second time I've watched this i seriously had doubts in Steven Stielbergs skills as a director, but then again it was made in 1975. This music was unbearably boring to sit through. Directors must realise that blood and gore in a film isn't what makes this type of film good. in 1975 m y opinion will have been a lot different, but its 2006 now and it bores me to watch this film. The only part of this film that was at the least mildy frightening was not frightening at all, it gave you a shock. Nothing more. People who love this film have the right to their opinions, but in my opinion this is one of the worst of Spielberg. Go watch War of the worlds or Close Encounter of The Third Kind. These are the true greatest Spielberg films.


                
Listen, no one should see any horror movies ever, ever, ever, because when it comes down to it, they just breed or perpetuate fear inside us all ALL. That being said, if you choose to subject yourself to such destructive media, at least have sense enough to protect the innocent and Do Not Let Any Child Watch Jaws Or Other Horror Films. I speak from experience when I say these words. At the tender age of 10 years old my dear mother allowed my sister and I to eat spaghetti (of all foods) on TV trays as we ignorantly watched Jaws mesmerized by the suspense and gore only to our demise as potential ocean lovers. I am 31 years old now and am still working hard to rid myself of "sharkaphobia" (or whatever the psychological term is). Have some common sense parents!!!!


                
This is just a cheap popcorn movie about a shark that eats people. Nothing about it is spectacular. It is not very scary either, and the ending is rather silly. I absolutely loathe Spielberg and everything he ever made.


                
Inevitably, we have to compare Jaws and Alien, two of the most significant horror-thrillers in the 1970s. Unfortunately, Jaws is worse than Alien. Particularly, jump scare in Jaws is a much cheaper and lousier approach than the atmospheric or slow-building approach in Alien. Also, the plot or story of Alien are much more reasonable and compelling than that in Jaws. Besides, the visual effects in Alien is better and smarter than Jaws.
