SNATCH (2000) Director Guy Ritchie flix this must have movie into the South - English culture with brutal gangsters and one punching taters.Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Benicio del Toro, Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones, all this good actors operates in this violent crime comedy that really entertians you! Depressive and smartass mood twisted into a state of mind of strong language and rough'n'tough characters. Explosive with its brutal way of telling its story. Benicio del Toro and Brad Pitt steals much of the show with their two indispensable parts of the movie (though del Toro's not too big). It may have some things like remind you off Fight Club and stuff, but it is without doubt very much the same of Ritchie's other English gangster movie Lock, Stock and Two smoking Barrels (also with Vinnie Jones). The story is fast and very nice put together where you switch cameras sometimes and may in the background you can see things happening in the other camera view, very good Guy!Statham is great and together with his partner Tommy they work for a brtual and disgusting gangster boss. They hire Mickey, a hard punching man living off selling caravans and loves his mum. We also get too mett Franky Four Fingers that are coming over from USA with some heavy diamonds...and more like that stuff... It is all about it's tagline: Stealin' stones Breakin' bones STARS: **** 4/5 (fast, violent and ugly)


                
'Snatch (2000)' is an energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors in which whatever could go wrong does go wrong. It's a series of eventually intertwining parallel stories each centred around a stolen stone which feature a cast of colourful, mostly inept characters with slightly weird names and a mainly cockney lilt (aside from the Russian, the American and the sort-of-but-not-really Irish thing that Brad Pitt tries to do). It deals in stereotypes and the comedy is pretty broad, but the film isn't so much funny as it is exhaustively coincidental in a strangely compelling way, with the usually dumb-as-bricks characters making a major mistake only to run into someone (sometimes literally) who then fixes that mistake or changes their path entirely. It's not so much a straightforward narrative as one that keeps you guessing as to where it's going to go while simultaneously not mattering at all, as it's the individual situations themselves that entertain. The fact it all ties together in the end is, strangely, kind of a bonus. 7/10


                
SPOILERS:: I cannot discuss my reaction to "Snatch" (which I suppose relates to the "snatching" of the large diamond) without commenting on the Imdb ratings. Currently it is #142 with a rating of 8.1, primarily by virtue of most voters being under 29, and I suspect most under 21. Among the "over 30" crowd, the rating is 7.5, which seems to me just about right. In many respects it deserves highest ratings for style, action, witty dialog. But the story, which is a bit convoluted and which involves all bad guys, as in "Lock, Stock...", is a rather poor one. As one professional reviewer said, "Guy Ritchie doesn't really want us to care about the story, it's all about the action."My main interest in seeing the movie was Brad Pitt. From the trailers, I was intrigued by his gypsy character, a bare-fist fighting champion who only needs one punch.  I think his performance is the highlight of the entire film, and again Pitt shows, as he did in "Fight Club" and "Twelve Monkeys", that he is one of the better and more versatile males actors.
James Barardinelli and Roger Ebert have excellent summaries of the film. For highlights, I really thought the dog swallowing the squeek toy, and "squeek-barking" was funny, as was "Something to declare? Yes, don't go to England." Much of the dark humor in "Snatch" arises from the ineptitude of the various crooks. If they were serious, competent crooks, then the film would not be very interesting. "Slapstick Crooks" would be a better name.The camerawork and editing, as well as the dynamic 5-channel sound, were all first-rate. Ritchie is certainly in a different league there. I will keep watching his films for their entertainment value, but it would be easy to criticize him for all the violence, a la "Pulp Fiction", and pervasive use of foul language.  We just have to remind ourselves, "It's only a movie."
Having seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels by the same writer/director, Guy Ritchie, and loved it, I very much looked forward to seeing this film.  While the story was different, the over all pacing, confrontations, and plot twists were very much the same.  It was if I had already seen it before.  Worth seeing nonetheless, especially if you haven't seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.


                
Guy Ritchie is known more for his romance and marriage to Madonna but he is a very talented filmmaker and snatch is a prove of this. This dark comedy/crime caper is an absolute laugh riot with some amazing dialogues that will have you rolling and characters you will remember for months. Rooted in the London Underworld Snatch is about a stolen diamond and believe it or not- boxing. How these two come together is for you to see and judge. Great performances, tidy flow and expert direction makes Snatch a must watch.


                
Snatch is an ensemble underground comedy which will leave you in splits. Starring a host of independent and mainstream(Brad Pitt) actors this British film is filled with humor- an absolute laugh riot with some amazing dialogues that will have you rolling and characters you will remember for months. Rooted in the London Underworld Snatch is about a stolen diamond and believe it or not- boxing. How these two come together is for you to see and judge. Great performances, tidy flow and expert direction makes Snatch a must watch.


                
"Snatch.": the tale of a stolen diamond, unlicensed boxing games, a promoter with the most peculiar hobby consisting on feeding his pigs with his enemies or debtors, and Irish travelers with caravans and accents as impenetrable as the plot that tries to tie all these elements together. Oh, did I forget there's also a little dog that can swallow everything, from a squeaking toy to... a more valuable item. Well, I think this dog is the living metaphor of whatever Guy Ritchie expect from us, viewers: to swallow anything, as long as it is funny. In fact, the film is quite funny, with a few outbursts of sheer comedic genius, but it's not as easily digestible as Ritchie's 1998 hit: "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels".Guy Ritchie has been accused of exercising in style with his second film, but he could also give the Hitchcock answer about style being only another name for self-plagiarism. And he wouldn't be totally wrong because "Snatch." can be looked as a plagiarism in tone and story structure of his 1998 hit film, same assortment of characters with colorful nicknames, same intertwined plots, same use of frenetic editing, slow, fast or stop motions, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Tom Ford reprising different roles and a screenplay loaded of one-liners, quirks and wisecracks, though not as memorable as the first.So accusing Ritchie of the whole "style over substance" isn't just pointless, it's unfair in the way he didn't attend to do anything substantial, his "Snatch." Is as much a joke as "Lock Stock".But he can't get away with this argument either, not totally. I saw the movie again and found myself amused most of the time, but never really riveted to the point that I would miss nothing from the film. It's like the style of Ritchie didn't allow the movie to bloom by itself, everything was more an excuse for a few throwaway gags and the character were only the foils of a deliriously intricate plot. A comedy where the focus is the story can afford slower moments, in the case of Ritchie's movies, it depends on who's on the screen and on that level, there are three characters steal the show.Vinnie Jones, as Bullet Tooth Tony, provides a monologue that almost equals Dirty Harry's description of a Magnum, and with the same intimidating effect, Tom Ford as the nasty-looking bespectacled Brick Top is quite convincing as someone to make you curse your mother for giving you birth if you ever owed his money and Brad Pitt overplays his mumbling accent as if he was conscious that the whole thing didn't even need to be clear, a stunt that reminded me of Benicio Del Toro in "The Usual Suspects". That his 'Mickey' would make an accent worst than the cockney slang they used is a great running gag by itself, that with his extraordinary punching skills. Not to mention that Brad Pitt looked great, and you could tell, he still had the 'Fight Club' look.Benicio Del Toro is another asset of the film, making a hilarious entrance as a pseudo Rabbi with an interesting lecture about the Virgin Mary... wait a minute, black-clad men walking together talking about 'Virgin'? A feeling of déjà-vu deepens. Anyway, Del Toro was great as Frank Four Fingers but wasted too soon. I guess he had to work for the movie that would earn him the Oscar the same year, the more serious "Traffic". The film has so many great and inventive characters, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) or Boris the Blade that not all of them have a real shining moment. Even Statham who has such amazing lines as "Turkish" in his first scenes becomes the passive observer he was in "Lock". Characters seem like the rather interchangeable elements of a plot too sophisticated for its own good. Even the build-up with unlicensed boxing games doesn't lead to a really satisfying resolution.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film for the most part of it, but thinking about it again, I'm wondering if it's not the sort of experience you can have as well by watching the best parts on Youtube. Ritchie rearranges all the moments like many clips of a parody series, and while it worked in "Lock, Stock" because it had a common thread, a major story-line... even the seemingly disjointed "Reservoir Dogs" had a plot. In "Snatch.", everyone is important enough for the story but not enough so that we care, it's funny and entertaining, but the film lacks structure. It is possible that Ritchie wanted to replicate his formula, with an all-American cast, and that was enough a novelty but maybe the detractors wished it was less than a replica, and more a Desert-Point-Eagle-type of film.


                
The British film industry is lucky.  Guy Ritchie doesn't like flying!The main criticism I'd heard regarding this film was that it was just more of the same from its predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Well I'd rather have a Lock Stock'2 than the 50 Runaway Brides that Hollywood deems worthy to force upon us each year!Of course it is impossible to avoid comparisons with Ritchie's remarkable debut.  The trademarks are all here - the larger than life criminal underworlders (including more racial stereotypes than all the Bond films put together), the far-fetched farcical plot, and the comicbook violence. However, Snatch is an altogether darker, harder tonic to swallow. 
While Snatch may be a lot darker in tone, with hard edged depictions of life in the depths of the criminal underworld (most notably the dog-fighting), it still delivers plenty of punch in its comedy.  The cast all seem to thoroughly enjoy their roles (most of which are pretty much straightforward cameos) with Brad Pitt perhaps steeling the show with his spot on coherently-challenged Gypsy boxer.Snatch is a brutally stylish, wickedly enjoyable British gangster film. More of the same then!


                
I'm not sure if this is a **SPOILER** or not, as it deals with camera work and not so much with plot.  I saw this movie knowing nothing about it except that it was by "the guy who did Lock, Stock" (which I didn't really like too much).  I think that knowing nothing may have made me enjoy it more.You've been warned.  :)You've all read about the actors, Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro were excellent, as usual, but the thing that blew me away was the camera work and the editing job done on this one.Every once in a while we see these great little 2-3 second clips that tell a whole story through about 20 different shots thrown at the audience so quickly that you'd miss them if you blinked.The only one I think I could possibly explain through a text based comment is the great way characters travel overseas:two men, one in London one in the US are on the phone.man in the US:  "I'll be right there"-shot of car screeching away-shot of passport stamp-shot of US man taking a shot-shot of plane taking off-shot of plane landing-shot of passport stamp-shot of car screeching away-show of US man standing in London man's officeall that happens in about 1 second.  :)  It's great!Aside from being amazed at the camera work, the story was interesting and original.  The characters were funny and well cast, and the dog was fantastic!All you "it's Lock, Stock part Two!" critics should give this director a break and appreciate this film on it's own.I rated this an 8.0 on IMDB.

Seen it multiple times now and I really think that "Snatch" tries too hard to be funny and cool. It is the british wannabe brother of Tarantino. It does make for an enjoyable watch though, but the style over content attitude becomes tideous at some point. Still it is funny at times. A lot of action, you wont get bored. And there is some good acting by Brad Pitt amongst others. A diamant gets stolen. And stolen again. And again. That's the story. Next to that there is another "storyline" in which Brad Pitt needs to go down in a boxingmatch in the 4th round to please some gangsta boss. But he wont go down. And he wont go down again. A lot of chases, threats and shootouts is what follows.The speed of "Snatch" is suited for kids wiht ADHD. The cussing is suited for whoever likes it. It looks like a trailer for a movie instead of being a movie itself because the speed of this thing is so fast that it becomes boring at times. As I said I have watched it multiple times already, so there is definitely something that is enticing, but there is something lacking also. Good B movie, for those who prefer style over content. And there is definitely a market for that. Me being one of those people, because sometimes I just like to see a mindnumbing action movie. When I watch it with that attitude in mind, "Snatch" is rather enjoyable...


                
Snatch is a very cool action-film that a few people know each other and then it will be a fight between them.I like this sort of films which fight each other and it will be a terrific fight until the end of the film.I like actor as Benicio Del Toro and Brad Pitt and they act very well and Guy Ritchies directing are fantastic! Guy Ritchie can make a action-film with much exciting and fighting and that is fun to watch.I recommended Snatch to everyone who like to watch a film with fun and action!I want to warn sensitive persons of a few violent scenes!


                
This movie has a lot of things. Action,Comedy,drama,Brad Pitt as an Irish boxer and a massive diamond. It was great. A must-see.Some might get annoyed by the camera work. The camera zooms in and out and spins around. I didn't mind it. It made it feel fast-paced.I loved the cast. Brad Pitt was great as the Irish boxer who no one can understand. Vinnie Jones plays a great gangster but i didn't like how his character was wrapped up at the very end of the movie. Dennis Farina(who i know from law & order)was very surprising. This has to be my favorite Jason Statham performance.As this is a gangster movie there is violence in this. But most of it is seen off camera.I recommend this. It is a good movie to watch with some friends. 7/10


                
This movie was very fun.Brad Pitt has an excellent performance.Benicio del Toro has a small,but excellent performance.This is a fun action comedy with a great style,but I thought this was going to be better.I expected more from this movie.The scene in which Avi takes a taxi and then he goes to New York is great.This is a fun movie,with good action scenes and touches of humor but,like I said before,I expected more.I think the genre of the movie is modern film noir with touches of humor.That description is a bit strange but if you see the movie you will see that it is not a strange description.So watch this fun movie because it is good.


                
A huge diamond is stolen in a heist in Antwerp and taken to London, but winds up in the hands of three petty crooks, who fall foul of a local gangster. Meanwhile, a street-boxing promoter hires an unlikely gypsy to take a dive in a match organised by said gangster. When he wins instead, things turn nasty. Also involved are a dodgy diamond merchant, his American cousin, a Russian gun-runner and a manhunter. Much confusion ensues.Writer-director Ritchie's second movie is a terrific gangster farce, a violent Cockney version of The Pink Panther, as the jewel passes back and forward between various unwitting characters with great names like Franky Four Fingers, Doug The Head and Bullet Tooth Tony. The wonderful script weaves together two separate story lines and a dozen different main characters so swiftly it leaves you gasping. The cast are fantastic, if only for their sheer variety; Statham is wonderful as the milk-drinking, much put-upon Turkish, and plays the whole movie with one amusing expression of slightly confused irritation. Ford, as arch-villain Bricktop, complete with yellow teeth and Health Service glasses, is a stunningly evil geezer, whose speech on the practicalities of feeding dead bodies to pigs is one of the film's highlights. Pitt is memorable in a flashy part as the incomprehensible bare-knuckle boxer ("D'ya loike dags ?"), and Graham, Farina, Jones and Reid all lend great support. Filled with eye-popping moments and lots of snazzy dialogue ("Who took the jam out of your doughnut ?"), this a terrific, hilarious, supercool crime caper filled with an irresistible gallery of lowlifes. Never bet against a gypsy.
Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels 2? Wouldn't really sound right would it? So what do you do? First of all you don't change the plot outline much (London gangsters in a pickle) but you do make a couple of slight cast alterations. Brad Pitt? Ah, why not he's a good looking guy after all. Only here, he is a gypsy boxer and puts in one of the best performances of his career. In my humble opinion Guy Ritchie is a fantastic director. His style is cool and dialogue hilarious. He is a cross between Tarantino (for the plots) and P.T. Anderson (for his knack of coaxing out great performances from less than great actors). So why did he do Swept Away?! Personally I don't think snatch is as good as LOCK STOCK... but is lighter and funnier. ***1/2 out of *****


                
The first time I watched this flick I was sorely disappointed...it was basically Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with a couple of different characters and Brad Pitt. Upon a second viewing, roughly 2 years later, it stands as a decent, funny movie...as long as LSATSB isn't fresh in your mind. Good soundtrack regardless.


                
In spite of appropriating both the essence and part of the story of `The Watch' section of `Pulp Fiction', this is a pleasant, though violent, diversion, fast-paced and filled with a large ensemble of memorable characters with lots of juicy lines to say. The writer/director, Guy Ritchie, doesn't seem interested in much more than showing what he's learned from watching Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese and providing a rip-roaring good time; the actors seem to be having fun as well. It's a crime comedy about a large diamond that gets passed around the underworld boxing scene in London and although the dialogue is mostly delivered with thick Cockney accents, the injection of a sizable Hollywood contingent (including Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and, as a gypsy with unintelligible diction, Brad Pitt) as well as the directorial influence gives the film a decidedly American feel. No great shakes but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours either.


                
I actually had no desire to see this movie...but my brother practically forced me to watch it and after i did....i wanted to watch it again... The characters were so funny and yet believable at the same time.  I loved Brad Pitt in this movie b/c he wasnt used as another pretty boy...the character of Turkish (also narrater) was my absolute favorite.  If you had reservations about seeing this movie discard them and get it.  Its funny, thrilling and keeps you guessing as to what is going on.


                
Guy Ritchie has recreated what he did with LockStock and it is true that Snatch is cinematographically a more accomplished movie than his full-length debut.If you were a fan of the old movie (that is having seen it 10+ times) you will be disappointed, otherwise it truly is a great and entertaining movie.This should probably work well in America where LockStock was not as big as it was in England.7/10


                
Although I don't consider "Lock, Stock,..." to be as good as "Reservoir Dogs", I believe "Snatch" is the brittish version of "Pulp Fiction", with different sense of humour and coolness. There's no Samuel L. Jackson in "Snatch" but there is a funny (and excellent) Brad Pitt; there aren't as many colours in "Snatch" as in "Pulp Fiction", but there's a lot more red blood (!); ... All these comparisons can be easily made between these two movies, but "Snatch" will never match up to "Pulp Fiction": this "new wave" of gangster movies is born right out of their time. And why does Guy Ritchie like to confuse the audience with a large-numbered cast? He did it in "Lock, Stock, ..." and he does it here again! Final though: "Snatch" with its character development and even story unleashing is the bigger-cast and bigger-budget version of "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels".


                
Funny, well directed but unfortunately NOT original. Same plot with "Lock Stock and Two smoking Barrels". Anyone that has seen that, will understand how similar the two movies are. The truth is that I expected something more from the director as I was thrilled when I saw his previous movie "Lock Stock...".
