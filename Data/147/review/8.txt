The story of Antonius Block is the story of an agnostic who has begun to doubt. Is life really meaningless? Is the only true ethic of life, to simply enjoy the moment? If God is there, why does he not answer? Why does he leave men with kind hearts and noble aspirations to fumble in the dark dying of the plague with no answers? Perhaps, Antonius reasons, the answers only come from Death.No wonder then, that as Death approaches him, he cajoles the spirit to play a game with him. His intentions are to win, but most importantly, to find answers. The little I know of Bergman's youth, the Paladin (Antonius Block) seems to symbolize Bergman's last struggles with his strict religious instruction as a child. Antonius' struggles, Antonius' angst, Antonius' withering agnosticism is a reflection of where Bergman was philosophically at this early stage in his life and career.The climax of the film is of course the final 'duel' with Death. Antonius attempts to cheat death and in the end, death cheats him. This is an especially crushing defeat for Antonius, because the answers Death gives him, about the knowledge within Death itself, is Antonius' worst fears come true.It struck me, that in the final moments, when each character faces there own mortality right in front of them, that the strongest and purest reaction of them all, is the one from the squire, the atheist voice in the film. I think if you are an atheist, this film is going to please you, because clearly the sanest characters in this film are either indifferent or deny God's existence entirely.Whether it was intentional or not, I think Seventh Seal is a very personal film. Bergman deconstructs his father's teachings to us openly. There's nothing sublime here; this is a clear rejection of religion and the notion that death somehow provides 'answers'. The only answers, according to this film, lie in life and not death. A message Bergman delivers to us in striking fashion. A message Bergman knows directly contradicts what he was taught as a child.I think this is why later in life, Bergman disowned this film. I think he saw too clearly, how much of a very personal statement it was and how in some cases it was a vindictive film against his parents. It's why I believe, Bergman, couldn't stand to watch it later in life, after he had reconciled with his parents.While Bergman disowned it, for the rest of us, we can admire it. For us, the Seventh Seal is simple genius.  A dark, but beautiful film, that is pure and meaningful, because it is so very personal. I confess, I am a layman and I know little of Bergman's work and indeed have only seen this film once. But, I loved this film. It struck a very personal reaction in me, however uninformed that reaction might be. That reaction, pure and simple is that this movie is a very personal statement about life, God and death.
This classic is filled with a lot of memorable images - from the opening scenes on the seashore to the effective concluding shots, creative thoughts are combined with some fine camera work.  There are several significant or interesting questions raised by the characters - from the imagery of the "Seventh Seal" in Revelation, to their simple but important concerns about eternity - but it is the way that the visuals play off of the ideas that make the movie so worthwhile.The recreation of the medieval world is convincing and effective, with a lot of detail to set off a varied assortment of characters with different personalities and perspectives.  The characters are not necessarily very deep, but most are interesting, and are worth caring about.  The ways that they deal with their discouraging situation make you wonder what it would have been like to live in their world.  It's also a movie that in some respects is even better to watch over again, after you already know what has happened and can then pick up even more of the detail and imagery.No doubt the somber tone and slow pace will always keep it from being widely popular, and it's not perfect, but it's satisfying in a different way, and deserves its reputation as a classic.


                
'I live now in a world of ghosts, a prisoner in my dreams', a line spoken by Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) in 'The Seventh Seal' is also a good descriptor of this critically lauded film. Directed by Ingmar Bergman, the film explores, through an allegorical fashion, human relationships and the struggle with ones own psyche. Block is a knight on his way home from the Crusades who becomes increasingly disillusioned while surveying his country, which has been ravaged by the Black Plague. Along the way he avers that he doesn't care about anyone, and questions the existence of a God who could allow these things to happen. In the beginning of the film he meets Death, who informs him that it is his time. Block manages to push off Death for a little while by distracting him with a chess game while he travels home; encountering several different characters, but Death is always following close behind until the inevitable end of the game. Bergman's style is not straight forward, rather quite symbolic and philosophical. The imagery at times is astounding, and I still (a month after seeing the film for the first time) see the image of 'the dance with Death' in my head when I think of the film. However, what I discovered was that this film carries with it a lot of intellectual and philosophical baggage that is not necessarily warranted. Nothing is really spelled out in this film, but it was much more easily 'accessible' than I thought it would be; I assumed I would have to put on my 'Affected Art House' hat on to watch it and nothing could be farther from the truth. Steeped in beautiful irony, the film, while having the pervasive specter of Death hanging over it, really celebrates life through its characters and their unusual circumstances. It is truly unfortunate that the powerful image of man playing chess with Death has become such a cliché, and oft repeated in some ridiculous manner or another. Bergman directed a thought-provoking and beautiful film with 'The Seventh Seal', and I personally look forward to seeing it again, this time not to grasp the story, but to marvel at the incredible images. I would recommend this film to anyone, but I especially highly recommend it to those who consider themselves students of film <U+0096> it will give you a lot to chew on. 8/10--Shelly
Dark, beautiful, meaningful, exploring the most serious themes of faith and searching for God, "The Seventh Seal" is known as one of the landmark Bergman's movies. One of the film's inspirations was a painting that Bergman saw as a young boy and was transfixed by: "There was everything that one's imagination could desire. Angels, saints, dragons, prophets, devils, humans. There were very frightening animals: serpents in paradise, Balaam's ass, Jonah's whale, the eagle of Revelation. All this was surrounded by heavenly, earthly and subterranean landscapes of strange yet familiar beauty. I remember Death playing chess with a Crusader, Death sawing at a tree to a branch of which clung a naked man with staring eyes, and across a gentle hill Death leading the final dance towards the dark lands" (Bergman in Hart). The film follows the journey of a knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returning from Crusades through Sweden ravaged by plague. The knight has lost his faith in the blood and horrors of the battlefield, "Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." On his way home, he encountered people dying from starvation and disease, being burnt as witches as well as Mr. Death himself who challenged him to play a game of chess and the family of a happy juggler, his wife, and their infant son. This family is happy because they love each other. They represent the simple joys and hopes of ordinary life. Everything about "The Seventh Seal" is extra-ordinary including acting. I especially liked Jöns, Antonius Block's misogynist squire - the best performance in the movie by Gunnar Björnstrand. His quotes about love are hilarious: "Love is the blackest of all plagues... if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love, but you don't die of it." "Love is as contagious as a cold. It eats away at your strength, morale... If everything is imperfect in this world, love is perfect in its imperfection." I know the film's reputation and I enjoyed watching it but it did not click with me completely the way the others Bergman's films did ("Fanny and Alexander", "Persona", "Smiles of a Summer Night") and I found myself bored few times. I keep thinking why? It seems to me that the movie is slightly overdone and overheated with its attacking images, abstractions and discursive dialog. I understand that it is a very serious film but while watching it, I could not help thinking how funny its images and dialog would look and sound in parodies. (Not as anything is wrong with that). Woody Allen obviously thought the same. :)


                
The film is developed in the Dark Ages , when a plague of pest sweeps throughout Europe , raging all around . A dreary , sad and disappointed knight (Max Von Sidow) is returning from the Crusades along with his squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand) . Meanwhile , he meets Death (Ekerot) who challenges him and they play a chess game . The stakes result to be the followings : If the knights wins , his life and his companies will be spared . Death offers him a reprieve where he deals with discussion of religion , God , his existence and personal demons . Besides , he knows a troupe of minstrels formed by a marriage called Joseph (Nils Poppe) and Mia(Bibi Andersson), among others .This classy picture contains powerful and haunting images . It is plenty of scenes that stay in mind , such as the appearance of Death , the flagellants parade , the torture and execution by means of a burning pole of an allegedly witch , and , specially , the ending sequence . Stunning casting by Bergman's usual actors : Gunnarn Bjornstrand , Bibi Andersson , Gunnel Lindblon and an awesome Max Von Sidow as the disillusioned knight in his first international great success . Wonderfully directed is all strongest for being brilliantly photographed in an excellent black and white by Gunnar Fischer . It is a masterpiece who made his major impact gaining international acclaim . His realization is during a spellbinding golden period from 1957-1968 when Bergman made memorable masterpieces : ¨Wild strawberries¨ , ¨Virgen Spring¨ , ¨Persona¨ , ¨The communicants¨ , ¨The silence¨ , and ¨Hour of Wolf¨ . Rating : Above average , it is deemed by many to be the Bergman's best .


                
Death, Death, Death. No matter the moves you make, Death will, in time, have you in checkmate. The Seventh Seal is a rightfully highly regarded film. It is a unique film, and unlike any I have ever seen. I have just finished my second viewing of the film. I have watched several Bergman films since I first saw this, but this is the one that has always stuck out to me the most. I would describe it as a dark and powerful film. There is nothing lacking in this film, in my opinion. The soundtrack is perfectly subtle, acting is agreeable, cinematography fitting and well done, etc. My favorite aspect of this film is simply the premise. A game of chess that is a matter of life and death. If nothing else, that concept is enough to make an interesting film at the very least. Death is the most persistent theme throughout the film, and is often juxtaposed to stark scenes of life, often quickly and without warning. This film was one of the first I watched in my everlasting pursuit of classic cinema, and I would readily recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in classic or foreign films. Bergman will not disappoint in this one or elsewhere in his filmography. This is probably his most famous and accessible films. This is a staple of classic cinema, watch it and find out why.


                
I didn't know what to expect from this film. The figure of Death on the cover in high contrast of black and white is disturbing yet compelling.While the plot in this movie is rather basic, the philosophical ideas are presented in a very engaging way. This taps into the primal human fear of death and search for answers. Not only the search, but the sometimes seemingly hopelessness of existence.Death plays a literal role as well as being a prevalent occurrence.****Spoiler**** When the young crusader starts talking about how God cannot exist with all the horrible death as a result of the plague it made my spine tingle. Very real and direct observations of faith versus immediate reality are made.For the crusader to do something meaningful as a last chance of figuring it out. However he never does figure it all out. He is content at having tricked death before he goes.The scene where the two characters are talking about women after the one's wife disappeared to cheat with the actor was funny. Here we have two guys talking about how women are useless, how you should kill them after a short period. Yet the men are weak because they are so dependent on the idea of having a woman. Then for the wife to pull it off later by being all sweet to her husband. Then she agrees to have the actor killed. This to me just shows the shallowness of both sexes, at least those two characters as husband and wife. The whole sanctity of marriage throne out the window. One portrayal of "good" religious folk being hypocrites.Also the portrayal of the religious fanatics burning the witch. When the "godless" crusader has the most humanity and compassion in not wanting her to die. He does not see Satan in her, just a girl hysterical like the men ready to burn her at the stake. ****End Spoiler***I think this movie is powerful in its ideas and not afraid to present them in a "in your face" way. The basic plot is rather dull but it doesn't matter because the ideas make you think. Some of the imagery and happenings in the movie are surreal in presentation.I would definitely recommend this movie if you like something different from your standard movie fare. Intelligent, well written and pretty interesting material that will make you think.
A great story which questions the meaning of life, death, faith, and the existence of God. Greatest movie of Bergman. You should watch this movie when you are feeling depressed or when you are in the mood for philosophical questions.


                
The Seventh Seal is a special kind of film because it deals directly with the reality of death, yet it retains a feeling of hope. Ingmar Bergman projects his fear of the unknown on the screen and, as an audience, we are able to relate because we've all felt the same type of fear. It is a beautiful film and it features iconic images and ideas. This is truly a classic.


                
"Det sjunde inseglet" isn't the first movie from Bergman that I watch. It's the second movie, after "Persona". I know it too well of appreciate the movie. You can just watch the high-rated movie and feel the beauty in it when you can't enjoy the middle-rated movie. From this site, I know that "Persona" rating is lower than "Det sjunde inseglet", so at the first I just learn to love the lower one. And from that, I can enjoy the higher rated movies from Bergman more. Imagine a baby, at first it is fed by breast milk, next the porridge. Until its teeth grow, it can eat bread, even meat. There are always some stages in life, and in movie's appraisal too. I just want to grow my teeth first. And then I can "eat" the other Bergman's movies. So, if you can't enjoy this movie, don't get too resistant, try to be more tolerant. It's old, Swedish, and very different from the nowadays movie, from the content to the cinematography. Like I said before, grow your teeth first, learn to enjoy unusual movie like this. I recommend this for you who want to takes cinema rather seriously. I mean you can get entertained with all kind of movie when you mastered it. And I limit it only for highest rated movies. I mean, why waste your time watching bad movies. Seems perfectionist, but it's my way.What I can say for this movie is very surreal. Yes, fantasy, enough fantasy combines with the Black Plague atmosphere. I just know the plague from "Plague" painting (1898) by Arnold Böcklin. A painting represents thousand meanings. And "The Seventh Seal" (1957) by Ingmar Bergman is just another kind of art which also contains thousand representation. The point is the fear of those society face with unidentified disease. That era, when only Bible is read, the book that's the source of all thought, people think of the end of the day. Witch, sins, all have the connection with plague. That is the protagonist who questions everything in that era. Yes, anti- mainstream idea of what actually life, God, and death are. Man that age just accept that concept in the raw. Of course, Antonius Block knows it is inquisition. But, what is the meaning of refusal when his personal idea contrasts with the society's idea, the religion. He just think, all those sins, witches, don't have any significance of plague. He actually thought of philosophy, the root of science. He isn't wrong, but his time is come, the Death. He just extends his dead-time to define who actually God is. And sure that death doesn't have any resemblance of God. A provocative idea, even until now. At the end, he just realizes it's wasting time to question all that thing in that era, he pray and beg the pardon from God who he doubt for. God is true, Death is real, that is the end of his idea.Yeah, that was all I see. What an amazing thought from that movie. The surreal aspects just to deliver those messages in an entertaining way. Of course, I also admire the very natural acting from that time. It's not exaggerating. The idea of Grim Reaper plays chess game is just the seasoning of this great motion pictures. The critical movie for society until this day, classic one. I personally amazed what Bergman try to say from this movie. "Surreally" beautiful drama!
The Seventh Seal may bore those who are too familiarized with the modern film era of constant action, but for me: I loved it. I found the performances to be fantastic; Jof in his goofy, fatherly role; Jons with his sarcastic, straight-faced demeanor; Antonius, passionate in his never-ceasing pursuit for knowledge of the existence of God; and Death--how could anyone forget Death? Ubiquitous, cunning, clever Death.My only problem with the film was that the promised thought-provoking religious and philosophical viewpoints were replaced with meaningless comedy scenes. I would have preferred to watch an intelligent film controversially prodding at said religion and philosophy, instead of tolerating the disappointment of only slightly funny comic reliefs.That said, I stand by my original statement; The Seventh Seal is a classic.


                
After ten years of futility in the Crusades Antonious Block and Squire Jon return home to be greeted by the plague and Death in its most recognizable human form. He has come for Block and the disparate group he travels with but is held up from this task when Block proposes a game of chess to avoid annihilation. Encountering communal responses to the plague as they travel along Block buys time clumsily attempting to stall the match after unwittingly revealing his game plan. This cinematic milestone may have lost a touch of its lustre over the years with a number of sharp homage parodies by the likes of Woody Allen and The Pythons but on it's own it remains a provocative examination of the meaning of life and ultimate fate seen from a variety of viewpoints. It is a film that begs introspection and while you may not identify with any of the characters it forces one to examine their own fate.Director Ingmar Bergman's script and imagery are rich in symbolism and his stock company of actors (especially Gunnar Bjornstrand's profane and cynical Squire Jon) up to the task in conveying their purpose of character. Bergman moves them like pieces in a game of chess but preserves their humanity through his signature close-ups and moments of occasional frivolity. Over half a century after it and a handful of other exports came to these shores and changed the way Americans looked at film The Seventh Seal today may show some of its age but it still retains the capability of being a very interesting conversation piece.


                
A story set in medieval times (presumably Sweden), with a knight who faces death (literally), a young couple, and some other characters. Fate is coming for them, as they live in the time of the plague.Film historian Ivan Butler sees elements of horror here (as he does in much of Bergman's work), pointing to the instances of "death, plague, religious fanaticism, intolerance, torture" and singling out the scene with Joseph is "forced at knife point to stand on his head, to climb on the table and dance like a bear." How much this is horror and how much it is everyday life in medieval Sweden, I really could not say.Ebert, meanwhile, says this film "has more in common with the silent film than with the modern films that followed it", and that "All of Bergman's mature films, except the comedies, are about his discontent with the ways that God has chosen to reveal himself." On that first point, this is decidedly so; Bergman has strong, stark visuals almost needing no sound at all to carry them. As for the latter point, this is an interesting interpretation and I do not know Bergman's work well enough to comment.I actually first came across this film indirectly, having seen "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey" and not being aware of the reference. Next, I came across it in "Last Action Hero". Those may not be high culture, but the fact that this film touched such remote genres really gives support to the strength of the work.


                
Seventh Seal doesn't have the strongest cinematography. It was made in black and white in the time when there was color film available. I know it was probably done on purpose but while it may help the message it does not help the visuals. The shots are not grabbing, not on their own.Also, the sound effects are not synced well. Quality of the recording is average. The music consists more of effects than of actual melody, which again maybe works for the message but definitely not for the aesthetics.What this movie has going for it are interesting themes, dialogue and good actors to speak it.The film is raw and direct. Has a feel of movies like Conan the Brabarian (1982), but with realism and intelligence replacing the action. It is about life, death, love, sex and cruelty, all set against the medieval time period. The dialogue consists chiefly out of the discussion of those subjects and has a poetic colour to it but not overly so. However, you must be prepared for a theatrical feel to the whole thing. Indeed many actors in this film are heavy theater performers.What is really good about Seventh Seal is that it is one of the, unfortunately, rare occasions when art is not pretentious or arrogant. You do not have to wonder hard about the spooky imagery. It does not try to patronize you with its poetry. It is perhaps cliché to even mention the scene that is most remembered about this film, that of the protagonist playing chess with death, but it is a good example. What is a more straight forward metaphor than that? This whole film is that way - straightforward.The downside of the story is that it does not have a lot happening in it. The storyline is mostly about the characters traveling through the countryside and meeting other people. There isn't one centralized structure to the story. But this does not stop the movie from being interesting.Max von Sydow is the main protagonist. To start with, this guy has an interesting face. He looks like a medieval knight, in fact almost like a caricature of one, with his underbite and long crudely carved face and short haircut. And he is a good actor on top that.Bibi Andersson who plays one of the side characters is possibly the prettiest woman I have seen in a very long time. She is conventionally pretty, but that is OK. And the film puts her in such poses and in such dresses and her blond hair shines in such light<U+0085>.in short, I experienced a brief crush on an 80 year old actress.But Gunnar Björnstrand, whose name I had to copy from IMDb for fear of getting an aneurysm trying to type it, is the true protagonist as he gets the most lines and gives them his best. Max von Sydow is more of an observer, while Gunnar is the workhorse.Seventh Seal manages to be funny and grim, smart and blunt. It is totally worth the watch, especially if you are afraid of watching it because you got the impression of it being an overly artsy film. It isn't.


                
This one it's certainly going to my list of favorites. The Seventh Seal manages to mirror a moment of society we're desperation leads people to act in extremes for fear of death. In a parallel way we see a group of people that share the same world, exposed to the same risks but instead of giving themselves to death even before being caught, they continue to live their life and worship it. The main character specially prefers to understand it instead of letting himself be scared by it. The entire story, the characters and the scenario make this movie brilliant and a gift for those who love cinema. The fact that it's in black and white gives it a certain mystery that nowadays movies sometimes lose. This movie is a perfect example that aren't big scenes, big visual effects or famous actors that make a good movie. I most certainly advise it but for those who aren't accustomed to see this kind of movie, keep your mind opened to different ways of presenting a story and ending it.


                
I feel like a fool for not loving this classic examination of the existence (or lack thereof) of both God and the meaning of life more.I appreciate it, with it's stark, lovely photography, attention to detail, marvelous performances, and sly dark sense of humor that balances the portentousness of the subject matter, and makes the film much easier to watch than my teen film-class memories of it. On the other hand, while I appreciate the film's importance in cinema history, and the bravery with which it tackles the biggest of issues in a head-on, intellectual way, I find it just that  a very intellectual experience, devoid of much in the way of emotion. I also find some of the writing painfully preachy and on the nose. Yet, in the end, I admire what it accomplished in its time, and how well it holds up 53 years later. And seeing as I went from not liking it at all, to liking it quite a bit on my 2nd viewing, I'm open to what a third seeing might bring.


                
this is the first Ingmar Bergman i have seen.Bergman is a very revered Swedish director.i wasn't sure what to expect with this film,but i had wanted to see it for some time.basically the story is about a knight named Antonius Block(Max von Sydow) during the time of the Black Plague in Europe.Block finds himself visited by "Death" himself(Bengt Ekerot),who reveals that Block's time is soon up.Bock himself already has suspicions so is not surprised,and in weird way,is resigned to his fate.and yet,to avoid or at least delay the inevitable,he challenges "Death" to a game of chess.if he wins,Death will leave him alone,at least for the time being.of course if he loses,his time is nearly up.as the match unfolds,we are shown various people who struggle to deal with the plague and its devastation,each in their own way.also,during breaks in the game,Block goes on a personal journey,to try to find some meaning in life in general, and in his own life.we see he is a very conflicted, tortured soul and longs to believe(that is have faith in God).the movie is very low key,very dramatic,yet really is compelling.i did not understand every nuance of the movie,not knowing what to look for,and the movie is subtitled in German,which makes it a bit harder to follow.this is mainly due to the fact that the subtitles sometimes omit parts of pertinent conversation. at least,it seems that way.either way,this film demands a 2nd viewing,which should fill in things missed the 1st time.one thing i do know is that Bergman is a very passionate director,and that shows,although ironically in subtle ways.the point is,although the movie is melancholy at times,i did enjoy it.For now,a strong 8/10
All great movies by definition are about our experiences or our anticipations, otherwise we wouldn't be able to recognize them as great. Significant part of this movie is about the way we die, which is of course a consequence of the way we live. Meet a searching agnostic (the knight), a self-assured atheist (the squire), a pious meek believer (the girl), a deluded Satan worshiper, a religious hypocrite, and a couple of characters who do not give a squat about god's existence. Send them on a journey through medieval country and watch them live and die. This is The Seventh Seal. There is also a model family, which walks off into horizon. It is this sugar coated bogus family, which slights the movie for me. 8/10.


                
The iconic image from this film is Max Von Sydow playing chess against Death, or The Grim Reaper, it is spoofed in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, so I was most looking forward to seeing the whole thing, from director Ingmar Bergman (Smiles of a Summer Night, Persona). Basically knight Antonius Block (Sydow) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand) have returned home from the crusades, where the Black Death is spreading. Antonius comes face to face with Death (Bengt Ekerot), literally, who tells him his number is up, but the knight challenges the dark figure to a game of chess for his life. This game continues throughout the film as cultural turmoil ensues around Antonius, and there are quite a few dark references to the existence of God and the Devil, and the very essence of faith. Through the film, you see travelling actors doing some weird voodoo play looking as though their praising the Devil, a Witch (Maud Hansson) is burned alive, violence is used to stabilise order and a few other dark occurrences. But the dark stuff is balanced out by a few light hearted and spiritual events, you can see Jof / Joseph (Nils Poppe) and his young wife Mia / Mary - Jof's wife (Bibi Andersson) with their infant son Mikael are meant to represent the Holy family. As far as I remember, Antonius gives away his idea for a winning move, as he knows he is most likely to lose the chess game anyway, and I'm guessing he does. Also starring Anders Ek as The Monk and Erik Strandmark as Jonas Skat. Being a Swedish film, it wasn't easy to understand most of what was going on, but looking back I can understand the religious messages that director Bergman (father of Ingrid) was trying to get across, and it is a most watchable classic period drama. It was number 70 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!
This was the first film I watched by Ingmar Bergman, and in my eyes it's one of his very best. Ingmar loved to ask whether God exists or not, and while he may have devised more subtle ways to ask that question in later films, his directness in "The Seventh Seal" is one of the film's strong points. Antonius Block returns from fighting in the Crusades (Max Von Sydow) when he gets a visit from The Grim Reaper himself (Bengt Ekerot). But Antonious is not ready to die, and in order to buy himself some time, he challenges Death to a game of Chess. The Black Death has also taken hold of Antonius' hometown, and the villagers have been plunged into fear of the plague (The Black Death and the Crusades did not occur at the same time in real life, and this film is not meant to be historically accurate) The game of Chess continues throughout the film, and it even manifests itself through other characters in the film (one of the very first corpses found in the film could very well be an early pawn taken during the game of Chess). As Antonius travels through a village, along with his Squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand, who steals almost every scene he's in), he meets a variety of people, the most important two people are Jof and Mia, a couple of travelling artists very much in love, who also have a young son. Sven Nykvist may not have done the cinematography, but this is still one of the best looking films you could ever see. The dark and moody atmosphere is brilliantly reflected in the dark clouds, sinister forests and wonderful use of smoke throughout the movie. The soundtrack really adds to the mood, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. "The Seventh Seal" is only 90 minutes long, and Ingmar Bergman manages to say more in this film than some directors can say in over twice the running time: The existence of God, man's mortality in limited time, the damaging effects of war on a man's faith and an artist's importance to humanity. "The Seventh Seal" is a dark, thought-provoking movie on the human condition. Not only is it classic Bergman, it is classic cinema.


                
Only in such a film as this (and very few others), does the 'colors' of black, white and grey clearly define a whole spectrum of feelings.From the fact that Antonius's life end is approaching, from none other than the personification of it, to the life-happy travelling actors, all the thinkable archetypes is shown in great detail. But, as the only colors are the three mentioned, it all gets so much more precise. As the human faces, skies, and all things in between get 'cut-out' with hard precision. Bergman paints this canvas with a grey but lively brush. And comments on it through the actors with a low but powerful voice all the way to the end.Watch it, and wait for it to sneak into your senses.


                
Did you ever questioned the beyond? How about existence? What death would be like and how to face the end? ..or the beginning?! The Seventh Seal is about Bergman's inner personal questions and thoughts that he was wondering about during his lifetime. We see as his perspective through the movie seeking for a meaning for everything that been told to us since we were too young to question them. It's not attend to be critical at anything at all, Just the things that a kid or a simple human being would ask to himself about all the meaning and beyond and death subjects. Would it be challenging? Definitely. But who else could have done it in a better way. Characters are so symbolic and all each represent to a form of human way of thinking and perspective. From a knight crusade to a circus clown they got much different ways of seeing and understand things from whatsoever happen around them to the all philosophical questions in life that would cross our minds. But Bergman is the director that could fit them so perfectly in a frame all together that not only it's so meaningful but still enjoyable to watch every minute of it. you can still watch the movie and enjoy it even if you don't seek a meaning or never questioned things or simply you don't care about these stuff. The plot narrate during medieval period that religions were reigning not only the lands but to more efficiently the thoughts and minds. Where every word of the bishop was absolute and the only salvation were in the hands of church, was there any room to question those things?! Well, You better watch this movie to find out whole.


                
Thus begins Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece Det sjunde inseglet, or The Seventh Seal if you prefer. A Crusader knight Antonius Block has returned to his home country Sweden with his squire Jöns to find it ravaged by the plague. Immediately upon their arrival Antonius meets Death and promptly challenges him to a game of chess with his very life as the stakes. From there we follow his journey across the land towards his castle where he believes his lovely wife to be waiting.The Seventh Seal is an epic. From the very first scene with Death standing on a rocky beach and sitting across from a disillusioned knight, we enter the realm of myths and legends. The scenes in the movie are somewhat disjointed. We might go from a prolonged scene of travelling actors playing roosters on a stage to a march of flagellants, religious fanatics whipping themselves bloody to earn salvation. Yet they all talk about much of the same thing. Why are we here? And now that we are here, what are we doing with the life given to us?The movie also ponders upon the so called silence of God. Why we have to live in uncertainty? Why the requirement for salvation is unquestioning faith? How are we supposed not to fear death when we have no guarantees. Antonius Block struggles with these very questions and the people travelling with him represent the different kinds of answers one might receive. None of them are hundred percent correct. Or perhaps they are, depending on your point of view. The movie lays down the questions and some of the possible answers, but in the end it's up to you.It's also a very impressive film visually, especially given the budget. Death, played by Bengt Ekerot, is especially memorable. His figure with a dark cape and a black cowl, almost monk-like in appearance, is one of the definitive images of Death in popular culture. And for a reason. Every scene he and Antonius share together is heavy, filled to the brim, trembling.The Seventh Seal was not at all what I expected, but then they so rarely are. Most definitely worth a watch for multitude of reasons, from the imagery to the themes to the story.


                
Read how this was a classic, and I can attest to it. Very strong film. It's been targeted for a so-called pretension, which honestly is uncalled for. The acting is very good. There are enough characters and sub-plots that this film has lots of life and depth to it; and speaking of depth, the very synopsis of it serves as a beautiful metaphor, not at all pretentious but rather deep in a sober, simple kind of way. The philosophical questions sit just right within the plot and within the veins of the various scenes, never too verbose but yet really saying something, asking relevant questions. The whole idea of the film is excellent, and beautiful, and very well executed. This is humane, strong cinema, with something real and meaningful to convey: purpose. What everything in this life is all about. Purpose. Excellent piece.


                
Film start with the man in black dress and its one off the best part i like the film concept and its formation are brilliantly show in the screenplay.The way the presented all location and the death is one of the best actor in movie. the concept of showing the chess game and the flashback its the perfect. so that way it connect to the film screenplay and its giving the message for humanity to the world without and type of confusion.so i like this film according to me film is the example off the master film which teach you how to write and read a film in the film the seven seal the camera works its perfect because its present the emotional with the film. there are many thing in the film which are untold and i was not able to read it because its not my story. but all over its a great movie.
