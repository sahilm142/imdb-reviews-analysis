It is time that Americans got to have this syndicated! This is the funniest sitcom I have ever seen. Thank goodness for the trips to the UK when I can sit around with my friends and watch it. I am a Rodney fan. My favorite episodes are the Chandelier episode, the Batman and Robin one, and Del and Trig in the bar where he falls down. This is top notch comedy. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh! I want to buy the DVD set of this if I can get it in American format. It's a shame other Americans have not seen this. I have not met one person here in the States that has seen it. All I can say is they are missing out on the world's best sitcom. American sitcoms are boring, British rock! God Bless Hooky Street!


                
It is the British who know how to write for television! Only Fools and Horse ranks at the top right along with Fawlty Towers, The Office, Keeping up Appearances etc. etc. It doesn't really get much better than this! Only Fools and Horses sadly never really made it to the TV screens in USA, but I highly recommend everyone to see it out on DVD which has recently been released in USA. David Jason (who also start in the fantastic British crime series: A Touch of Frost) has to be one of the greatest British actors of all time. Del Boy and Rodney no doubt became major icons of UK television during the 1980s and 1990s and they even returned a few times during the past couple of years for occasional specials! Bravo all the time on this one!


                
This is a remarkable body of work and I am so glad that I took the chance and bought it! It started in 1981 and ended in 2003, but unlike American series it didn't drown the watcher and the last three episodes were a year apart! There was even one 3 year gap between 1993 and 1996 and one 5 year gap between 1996 and 2001 before they took up the series again. Never have I seen such continuity in story lines. It is amazing to me that the same actors kept coming back year after year to create this wonderful body of work. It deserved every award and accolade it ever got and those were many.The first few seasons were half hour comedies and are hilarious, but you soon get to know these characters and become emotionally invested in their stories especially when they expand to full hour shows. By season 4 I was not just laughing, but crying. "Only Fools and Horses" succeeded in being both hilarious and extremely endearing. We are so lucky that we get to watch their stories unfold completely without having to wait 22 years. Best of all it answers the big questions and ties it all together by the final episodes. I can't imagine how invested people must have been who waited 22 years to get their answers. I know not everyone will like this series. My husband didn't like "To Hull and Back" and I do admit I didn't care much for "Miami Twice", but even these offerings are worth watching for the comedy and irony. A great show well worth your money and your time. This is indeed the best Brit-com ever made!!!


                
Only Fools & Horses has never really been one of my favourites but for over 20 years i have enjoyed it when it has been on television and has gave me many a laugh. My life at the moment isn't actually what you would call sweet so a lot of the time i mope around like a miserable git and laugh at few things. Couple of weeks ago i decided to sit down and watch Only Fools & Horses on UK Gold and you know what? I haven't laughed so much in years! I was laughing so much my sides were splitting which not even top comedies like Fawlty Towers or Red Dwarf could do. Now the episodes i've been watching were the ones from the eighties which are by far the best of the bunch and the last time i seen them i was a kid so i didn't fully appreciate the humour but now i'm in my late twenties it's like ten times more funnier! The episode where Del wins Rodney a holiday and Rodney has to pretend to be 14 is absolutely priceless. That cheered me up no end. I would never ever buy Only Fools & Horses on DVD for the main reason that comedies of this calibre shouldn't be watched over and over again. I'll catch the episodes in another few years time so i can laugh just as hard once again. I never thought that Only Fools & Horses was this good but me uncontrollably laughing proves otherwise. HAHAHA Rodney's expressions when Del does something he doesn't like! Man, you all have to watch this brilliant British comedy. By the way, Trigger ROCKS!!!


                
I have been a British telly fan for about ten years.Being American our TV(with very few exceptions)is horrible at best.So I watch mainly UK programs.I have to say that OFAH is television at its absolutes best!!I have only recently discovered this series through DVD release,but I had first heard about it years ago.The fact that this show has achieved such legendary status in its homeland is no surprise.David Jasons a wonderful actor and Debby is no doubt his masterpiece.I don't believe a show this good will ever come along again.Im just glad it came along once!!The best thing about it is the fact that Derek and Rodney are so different,but they have an unbreakable bond.The show dealt with some serious subjects but never in an abysmal manner.They weathered all sorts of problems but always managed to survive.I truly adore this show as i'm sure millions of others around the world do.All I can say is thank you Mr.John Sulliven for creating a masterpiece that will surely stand the test of time forever!!Besides The Beatles, OFAH is the most important, entertaining,timeless,culturally significant piece of entertainment,to emerge from the British Isles.One of the greatest(perhaps the greatest)body's of work of the 20th century!!


                
Only Fools and Horses is of best comedy sitcom ever aired.This shows has every thing from quality comedy to romance love, feeling of responsibly,family. this show is very addicting once you watch you are going to feel that you are part of show.This show has been ranked as British top No.1 sitcom ever aired.David Jason performs the role of Delboy perfectly.Rodney Granddad,Uncle Albert,Trigger all are awesome.Its been a long time since the watched the series but the Dialogue still rings in my ears.He Who Dares Wins still Inspire me.I salute John Sullivan for creating this master piece. I hope if they could continue this series with all original characters and we can have all the fun and entertainment


                
Over the years there were many great comedies out there, but Only Fools And Horses tops them all. There are so many things you love about this show its amazing. Every single episode is funny, and when I say funny, it's really understatement. I've watched hundreds of different shows during the last 20 years, and I can honestly say that this show is in the whole new world from the rest of them. It is really amazing that after all these years this show is still funny. It is just original, the cast is unbelievable, Del Boy, Rodney and their friends, their roles, this show will live forever.Only Fools And Horses is so amazing especially when you see the rest of the cast, not counting DelBoy and Rodney. Boycie, Trigger and the rest of the gang they all make this show the greatest comedy ever written and produced. Well done!


                
What can you say about OFaH? A bright spot on the telly whenever on, it never failed to shine. There's just too much to mention on situations, favourite episodes/lines/moments etc. Del Boy (the comic genius, David Jason), Rodney (Able Nick Lyndhurst) Grandad (Lennard Pearce) and of course, Albert (Buster Merryfield) gave us the best comedy ever. Ducking and diving, wheeler-dealing Del, not successfully of course had all manner of scrapes. Dipstick 'Rodders' and Grandad and Albert, who replaced the latter in the family on Mr Pearce's demise provided great support. Although the likes of Raquel and Cassandra were the stable ladies at the helm for the duo, they still helped provide great moments - as did tarty Marlene, boastful shady but successful husband, Boycie, dim Trigger, manipulated Denzil and Mike the pub landlord. Mickey 'the fish' Pearce often gave us a chuckle. Dodgy French, overwhelming cocktails, leopard skin beds, rings/jewellery were Del's forte as was his un-worldwise uncultured views. On Rodney trying to discuss the sensitivity of condoms in a magazine advert: Del: "...don't worry, they aren't really THAT size!" Rodney carries on: "I know that! It's not that, it's just, well, there's a 'stigma' attached to this sort of thing." "Nah..." says Del, "That's just a bit silver foil on it!" COSMIC!!!!
Quite simply the best British TV show of all time and one of the best in the history. Written by The late great John Sullivan and featuring the talents of David Jason, Nick Lyndhurst and Buster Merryfield to mention just a few, only fools was always destined for greatness, the lovable and relatable characters, the perfect plot, sublime script it just couldn't fail to win the hearts of the viewers.It became a steady diet for the British public with almost 25 million people watching the episodes which at the time was half the population of the country, a viewing record that still stands today, it is one of the very few TV shows that could make you laugh uncontrollably one minute then cry your eyes out in the next. I could go on and on about this masterpiece, talking about my favourite episode (the unlucky winner is, series 6 episode 4), or my favourite feature length special (Heroes and Villains), but I wont, maybe the American readers haven't had the pleasure of watching only fools but please do give it a chance you won't regret it.


                
As good as comedy gets- Whereas the earlier series were good- the show matures- and so do the characterizations. By the time we get Uncle instead of granddad the show is in its full stride (It was sad loss however that brought about the cast change.) I urge all who have not seen this show to give it a chance- you will not be disappointed. The show demonstrates changing views over the last twenty years- It is amazing just how much the world has changed. Do not let the culture differences between British and American Humor worry you- whereas i am admittedly a transplanted Brit here in the States- the show has gained many a fan by my American family, friends and neighbors. In fact my American wife is about as big a fan of the show as you can get.


                
Only Fools & Horses provided both myself and my family with years of incomparable viewing pleasure and entertainment. As a child growing up in England I spent many an evening with my family watching OFAH both on BBC One and on Gold, and despite all the years of repetitive viewing I still find OFAH just as entertaining as the very first time I watched it all those years ago. To say that Only Fools & Horses is timeless is a serious understatement, in my mind it is an all time great! which will never be shelved nor forgotten. For me Only Fools & Horses is not purely a comedy or a drama but a crucial part of British culture that has provided a backbone to British Family life for the last 30 or so years as Families up and down the United Kingdom continue to enjoy the nations greatest sitcom, together. In my opinion OFAH is one of the few comedies around that can genuinely provide an entire family unit with hours of entertainment without the fear of sexual content/references, bad language or violence, all of which seem to be increasingly finding there ways into so called modern 'comedies' (which are no where near as funny as this old gem!). I should also commend the late John Sullivan for the incredible story lines and imaginative plots and of course the brilliant actors: Sir David Jason (Del boy), Nicholas Lyndhurst (Rodders) and all the other cast members for their brilliant transformations into some of the most demanding and challenging roles ever to be seen in a sitcom, all delivered with perfection!!Only Fools & Horses, you win the Gold for pure comedy genius!


                
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter (David Jason) is a brash, loud mouthed South London 'wide-boy' who lives in Nelson Mandela House, a council flat or, as he lovingly calls it, 'a lego set built by the council', along with his grand-father and his much younger brother Rodney (Nicolas Lyndhurst) an idealistic, well-meaning young man who has sadly become rather bitter and cynical at being out of work despite having three GCEs and at the immorality and hopelessness of his older brother's frequent get rich quick ideas. Despite his cocky bravado, though, Del does seem genuinely motivated to do well in business so he can provide a better life for him and his family, always trying to stir hope up within his ranks with his frequent, but never kept, promise that 'this time next year we'll be millionaires...'Although any night of the week I am practically guaranteed to run into an episode on UKTV Gold, having just brought series 1-7 of what is easily one of my favourite sitcoms ever in a sale for £39 (nearly a hundred quid in HMV!) has brought what made it all a success racing back to me. But then, it's a testament to how great it is that it's done so well and that, well, I can tune into an episode any night of the week.Del is the main character here, the guy the show pretty much revolves around and it's quite clear to see why. Lyndhurst's Rodney is a vital part as Del's fall guy, and grand-dad was always a good character to have around, until Lennard Pearce's death in around 1985 had him replaced by Buster Merryfield as the livelier Uncle Albert. But Del is the guy who really keeps the boat floating, the self assured, wise cracking wide boy with his frequent catch-phrase's, including the afore-mentioned '...we'll be millionaires', as well as trying to stir up more hope by frequently using the SAS's motto 'he who dares wins' and not to mention taking his exaggerated gift of the gab a bit too far by trying to pronounce sentences in languages he doesn't know the first thing about (...'borsch sprung dung technik!!!') But he can also show his darker side with it, often trying to play on Rodney's emotions by using the memory of his dead mother to force him into helping him with his latest zany scheme, telling him 'you know what the last thing your mother said to me on her death-bed?...' Rodney's the character it's easiest to have the most empathy with, an intelligent, conscientious young man who suffers constant embarrassment at his older brother's lack of tact and knowledge, but who somehow always finds the courage to answer him back and stand up for himself. You can sense him wasting all his passion and intelligence away due to his lack of employment history and, unfortunately, a criminal record for smoking cannabis. Both Jason and Lyndhurst sound a lot more posh and elocuted in real life, so it's harder to relate to them as true South Londoners but they play their parts so well you can put it to one side. There's a host of lively supporting character's to choose from too, including Boycie (John Challis), the second hand car salesman, constantly sneering down at what he sees as the inferior Trotters and who Del secretly probably wishes he was like, and Trigger (Roger Lloyd Pack) the blank faced (and blank minded) road sweeper who can't seem to get over the fact that Rodney's name is Rodney and not Dave. He lives in a world of his own but seems to have his own weird logic to things that gets him by in life.A product of Thatcher-esquire Britain, a time when everyone no doubt needed a good laugh and which John Sullivan delivered perfectly. It probably went on a little too long, and the cracks were definitely showing by the last episode, but the timeless overall result leaves it a classic still. *****


                
Two people who wind one another up - it's a staple of situation comedy, from "Red Dwarf" to "Blackadder" to "Only Fools & Horses". It's the sibling rivalry perfectly conveyed by the actors and scripts that makes "Fools" so warm and special, though.David Jason has inhabited the role written on the page so completely that he is now the true original, and any Cockney wide boys armed with braces and Filofax are just copycats aping their hero. Rodney, played by Nicholas Lyndhurst, is the gawky younger brother used as a stooge by his crafty go-getter relative. The family unit was rounded off by two older house-guests, and longtime series fans can be divided into two camps over whether they prefer Lennard Pierce's Grandad or Merryfield's Uncle Albert. I'm a Buster man myself - probably due to my age and the fact that the brothers were less inhibited about making fun of him more.These were characters most people from a working class family could relate to, and we shared their own feelings about their numerous setbacks and occasional triumphs. It was truly a joyous moment when they finally got what they had spent years hustling for, and perhaps that's how these larger-than-life tradesmen should best be remembered. Familiarity made it good to see them back in the one-off specials, but deep down they will always be a pair of opportunists who somehow managed to steal our hearts when we weren't quite paying attention, and there's only so many ups and downs a streetwise life can take! Only Fools and Horses will go down in the history books as perhaps the most unpretentious and genuinely affectionate serial of its type that's ever been made.


                
'Only Fools & Horses' has experienced a slight fall from grace in recent years, with its reputation questioned by, amongst others, comedian Arthur Smith, who made unfavourable comparisons with 'The Office'. Repeats have possibly resulted in overfamiliarity breeding contempt, as well as confusion ( the episodes being screened wildly out of sequence ). Its certainly true that the post-1996 Christmas shows weren't up to standard, but all this is to ignore the series at its best. The fact it that 'Only Fools & Horses' is a prime contender for the title of best British sitcom of all time. Brilliantly written and acted throughout.In 1981, when it started, 'Only Fools' was just another comedy. Each episode was thirty minutes long, the only regulars were Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter, his brother Rodney, and their Grandad. Stories revolved around Del Boy's latest 'get rich quick' scheme which, predictably, would fail badly.But as it developed, and steadily rose in popularity, it evolved into something else - a comedy soap, if you like. When it was expanded to 45 minute episodes, supporting characters such as 'Trigger', 'Denzil' and 'Boycie' became as much a part of the show as either Del Boy or Rodney. When the latter married Cassandra and the former began a relationship with Raquel, that was when it really hit the button.Those who claim that the show's humour is intrinsically dated are wrong because the show is essentially about human relationships and that theme will never date. Despite their constant bickering, Del Boy and Rodney are devoted to each other. When gangsters threatened Rodney, Del Boy agreed to take a beating on his behalf. A sitcom about hate is never going to have the longevity of one based on love.The death of Lennard Pearce in the mid-80's threatened to derail the show, but John Sullivan bravely decided to make Grandad's death into an episode, one that set the scene for the arrival of Uncle Albert, brilliantly played by Buster Merryfield.As other sitcoms come and go, 'Only Fools' will always be around somewhere. My favourite episode - 'The Jolly Boys' Outing'. Just watching the Trotters and their friends having fun at the seaside is a sheer joy!A word of warning - if you're thinking of getting your chandelier cleaned, don't call the Trotters, okay?
John Sullivan perfectly captures the life,loves and losses of the Trotter family in this inch perfect sitcom. We find ourselves rooting for the lovable losers Del and Rodney as they try to become millionaires.Supported by a strong second tier of characters including the snobby Boycie and dim Trigger each episode of this show has magic moments with the chemistry between David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst is spot on.This is by far one of the best comedies ever produced as it has the unique ability to be both funny and touching at the same time. Not all the episodes are classics and the later specials were a mistake but this cannot spoil the fact that John Sullivan regularly creates moments of comedy gold that will live on forever.


                
I adore Only Fools and Horses, along with Last of the Summer Wine and Blackadder it is one of my favourite comedy series ever. It is original, it is well written and acted and more importantly it is funny! The scripts are absolutely hilarious, I have lost count of the amount of times I have cried laughing in one episode alone, and how many times I have quoted something from the show. The story lines are great fun and original, maybe the situations have been seen before but how it is handled and acted out is exceedingly clever no matter how extremely silly it gets. But there have been times when it has been suitably serious, Uncle Albert's death and Cassie's miscarriage especially were effectively done.The performances are astounding. I am a massive David Jason fan, and he is fantastic as DelBoy, a naughty but a nevertheless lovable character. Nicolas Lyndhurst does a great job as Rodney. Then there is Grandad (Leonard Pearce), later replaced by Uncle Albert(Buster Mayfield), the oft-source of DelBoy's pranks; with either character you're bound to have a good time, though if I had a slight preference I have to say Grandad. Pearce's delivery of hilarious lines was priceless, though I'd have to say the same for Albert's war stories. Roger Lloyd Pack proves he is great at comedy as Trigger as well. The theme tune is fun and memorable. Favourite episode? That is such a hard question, I don't think I can answer that, though the one with Del and Rodney dressing up as Batman and Robin was a scream. In conclusion, comedy at its greatest. If you want some top notch comedy, just put Only Fools and Horses on. 10/10 Bethany Cox


                
I love Only fools. To be honest I didn't watch it much until it ended, I have been catching the reruns. David Jason and Nicolas Lyndhurst were fabulous as Del Boy and Rodney. There are so many iconic moments, for instance the episode with the chandelier. My favourite episode is the one in which Rodney pretends to be teenager when Del Boy,Rodney and Cassandra go on holiday. Another favourite of mine is the one in which Del Boy and Rodney dress up as Batman and Robin.The catchphrases are just as iconic as the characters,for instance lovely jubbly or he who dares win. For a comedy show it is also quite emotional. How they dealt with Grandad's funeral was outstanding. All the credit goes the writer John Sullivan. He made us laugh at the Trotter brothers for an outstanding 22 years. Sullivan also gave us some memorable 'side characters', for instance Trigger. Sullivan created an comedy gem that can be enjoyed by all ages and will never age.


                
This is an absolutely Excellent British Comedy, right from episode one "Big Brother" (which was criticised) is hilarious!Every episode i've saw has made me laugh at least once, my favourites from series 1-7 are the one where they go to Spain, big brother, series 5 and 7 finale and others i can't remember.But i'd love to discuss the last ever episode "Spleepless in Peckham", i don't understand the negative reviews this episode was given, the last 5 or 10 minutes are very emotional, there were tears in my eyes, i thought i was gonna cry, so very emotional, a great ending to the Only Fools And Horses series.Bonjoeur!
If you ask anyone for their favourite comedies of all time, this one would be in everyones list, as everyone knows this programme for its cult status and iconic figure in Del Boy. However, I was confused as to why it has never been shown in America, as in seems like every American load of rubbish is shown here. So if some television person in America is reading this I would advise you show it, even if it is 10-20 years old.There are so many classic moments and scenes which everyone knows and remembers (eg when they turn up as batman and robin) and will mean that nobody will ever forget this pure masterpiece of classic British comedy.It is right up there with many other old comedies like Fawlty Towers, which is the funniest comedy of all time, Steptoe and Son, Open All Hours, Porridge, and many others which I don't have time to list, otherwise I could be here writing for years.


                
The most amazing, most catching Series that has ever flickered across the screen.Being a sitcom, the term Dramedy would be more accurate. The writer John Sullivan had the unique gift to totally control his audience's feelings. He, more than any other was able to make you laugh and weep the next second or even do both at the same time.Set in Peckham, London in the 80's the series follows the lives of the Trotter family, more accurately Derrick 'Del Boy' Trotter (Sir David Jason), his brother Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst), their Granddad (Lennard Pearce) and their uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield). They are defined by their ongoing struggle to make a living and bickering amongst themselves, but most of all by their incredibly deep love for one another. Often as not they get each other into trouble but they will always be there for each other and help each other out. While Del Boy is the "wheelin' and dealing" older brother, young Rodney is struggling to come to terms with his life. Having lost their mother and being deserted by their father at a young age, it was up to Del Boy to raise Rodney and provide for the family, always sticking to his motto "He who dares - wins". While his plans fail as often as they work they somehow always manage to get on by what they have.We find them joking about a time after a possible nuclear war and laughing, and the next thing we know, granddad is telling the brothers off by reminding them that he was there during the war and that "(they) were promised homes fit for heroes. (They) got heroes, fit for homes." Likewise we grieve with them as they bury their Granddad and then cannot help laughing when the hat they threw in the grave, believing it to be Granddads, turns out to be the vicar's.In 2006 ITV rated Sir David Jason as "the Greatest Star", not least of all because of his ingenious portrayal of Del Boy.The show has in its day won 6 BAFTAs, 7 British Comedy Awards, Several National Television Awards and Royal Television Society Awards, earning it an overall of no less than 25 awards overall.While these numbers strongly speak for themselves, it must be noted, that the 1996 episode "Time on our Hands" was watched by more than a third of the British population.It may also be noted that we know many of the less regular cast members including Roger Lloyd Pack and Jim Broadbent from films like the Harry Potter series.It is then, summing up, safe to say that no other TV show in history had as big a cultural impact nor is as much appreciated it the country of its origin, nor has any other series touched as many hearts.
No other sitcom can come close to this one. It is by far the best and funniest show ever! The first season is great and they just keep on getting better and better. The writer, John Sullivan is a genius. It is just amazing how all the characters interact with each other. Patrick Murray as Mickey Peerce is great as is John Chalis as Boyce. Trigger is too funny. The leading characters, well, there cannot be enough said about them. The show is just plain AWESOME. Wish they showed it in the states. I had to buy them all. I never get tired of watching them over and over again and it never ceases to amaze me what a gem of a show it is. You cannot know FUNNY until you have seen ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES. :-)


                
No matter how many times you watch it you will still laugh. Nearly every episode is a classic apart from the last three. I have watched every episode multiple times over the last nineteen years and still watch them occasionally, that's how good it is. It is very rare to have a sitcom produce so many great episodes, David Jason and Nicolas Lyndhurst are brilliant. Roger Lyoyd-Pack who plays Trigger is always funny and John Challis is great as the sly second hand car dealer Boycie. I can't say enough about this, if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor WATCH IT. If you don't find this funny, there really is something wrong. CLASSIC ten out of ten!!!!


                
Wow its been around so long and still no other British comedy has come even close to this fantastic series.I grew up with this but it was around before i was! The antics of Delboy , Rodders and the rest of the gang have always got me in stitches of laughter. This show really has set the benchmark of real quality comedy should be and the 'hookie' world in which they live is very believable.Rodney as the goofy , tall younger brother and Delboy the older,respected but less educated older brother. Grandad and Uncle Albert were as funny as one another and the series wouldn't be complete without them. Pity that the series only consists of around 50-60 episodes but many Christmas specials and i guess that is what makes this series complete and unique in every way.


                
Only Fools And Horses is without doubt one of the finest comedy programmes ever. Full of great characters, Del Boy, Rodney, Uncle Albert, Trigger etc, writer John Sullivan has produced many classic episodes. I think OFAH was at its peak around the late 80's early 90's. Sadly I think the last Christmas episode proved they should stop making them now as it wasn't that great. Still they've had a good run for their money as it started in the earlty 80's! David Jason is a superb actor he should be a big movie star by now. Lovely Jubblie!


                
I have bought the first 5 Series on DVD so far and will buy the rest when they are comming out. This is one of the best series I have ever seen (and they are worth every penny, cent, euro) or whatever currency you have in your country. Just order them they are TERRIFIC, or as mum use to say .... you will understand when you see them.
