 My brief review of the film

 End it already!

 Such a disappointing journey

 immensely frustrating

 A mediocre film for the masses

 It's a highly overrated film.

 Mediocre. Spoiled.

 Computer game over

 the weakest part in the trilogy

 overwrought does not equal epic

 The end of all things

 3 movies of repetitive nonsense and where the feck is Sauron?

 Most overrated film.... ever

 The end was a nightmare

 B-list material disguised as an "A" movie

 huh?

 Fantasy is not my cup of tea

 Good?

 Not worth it, sorry

 Another bland LOTR movie

 Lacking conclusion to an otherwise great Saga

 A beautiful letdown

 Orcs Galore!

 Let's all just calm down with this 'best trilogy ever' talk....

 This one was definitely the best of the three
