 Loved the first 2 seasons

 Entertaining though one dimensional

 Series One

 Hmmmm, on the whole I kinda liked it but

 Could be the perfect show a decade ago...

 Good package, not so great content

 Far-fetched style series with poor contents

 Second season was such a let down

 Solid, But Not Quite Excellent

 Worst sound track ever!

 75% is great, than it collapses
