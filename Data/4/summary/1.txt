 very weak, unfortunately

 Erm...really? (may be a couple of spoilers)

 Who payed the critics

 Why so much hype?

 ridiculous rating

 Why so happy? Let's put a frown on that face!

 I didn't like it! Oh! Heaven for offend!!!

 Too much of everything

 The Dark Knight is overrated.

 warning contains spoilers, OVERHYPE, NON-EVENT

 The Dark Nothing

 This movie was a joke...

 Are you people paid for rating this non-event a tener?

 Seriously? SPOILER

 I know it's awful and I don't even READ comic books!

 Do you have 0 rating as well??

 Unwatchable - only 1 sound guy?

 A massive let down after the brilliant Batman Begins

 Too implausible and too dark, but not terrible

 This was not a good film.

 Way Overrated.

 A Testament to the Stupidity of Our Times

 Plot so thin, it passes unnoticed.

 Just what Iexpected - It's a self-parody

 The 'Dull' Knight
