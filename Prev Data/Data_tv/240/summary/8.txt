 It's Fun and Sweet!

 It's sixth form, not high school.

 Not your usual teenage series bull***

 funniest sh't ever.

 A great new show, that has a deep meaning

 Very good

 Clever, funny and original

 Spot on!

 A series for every teen

 not just about the kids...

 Add to your watchlist!

 So fresh and surprised.

 Just wow

 Very good

 New, Funny, Informative and Binge-worthy

 Funny and engaging but culturally unrealstic for a British setting

 A great watch for the right audience

 Review of the series

 Don't really get the ending

 Outstanding show

 A wry and entertaining look at sixth form college through the lens of therapy

 Fun but with some substance.

 Very enjoyable

 Catchy and addictive

 Great show
