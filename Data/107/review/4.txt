While it's sorta, technically a sequel, as Never Say Never Again was a James Bond movie, this movie at least took a different direction than the "original," (A) Fistful of Dollars. But, it nowhere near held my interest as Fist did. Actually the best thing about it was the Man in Black, No- Name-Clint's character's nemesis/partner. Other than that, the score was good and I do favor Clint's persona in these Westerns. Not my cup of tea, but I guess people who like Westerns, specifically Spaghetti Westerns with all that dubbing and outside scenes doubling for America's old west, might like this. (On a side note, were guns less powerful back then? They never seemed to hurt anyone's ears, nor leave any marks in either people's bodies or – laughably – clothing.)
They don't come much worse than this one. A few interesting scenes but as usual with Leone this thing drags and drags. And his bad guys are so despicable and unclean they render themselves unwatchable. Do yourself a favor....Spoiler alert: and fast forward to the final scene, skip the rest of this turkey. It wasn't very popular in the 60's and doesnt translate at all now. BTW, Walmart sells the entire Leone series for $9.44 apiece, and for a reason. Help yourself. 1/10
