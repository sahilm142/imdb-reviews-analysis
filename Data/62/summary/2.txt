 Bad taste gone worse

 This movie confirms Tarantino's brilliance, and it's dreadful.

 Quitting Quentin

 Forget The Slaves, Free The Audience

 pile of crap!!!

 Insanely overrated

 Revenge is always the way forward...

 Maybe Tarantino should just stop talking about retiring and actually do it.

 Over-rated, corny and a with a cliché ending

 Tarantino hates the way history turned out

 crap

 Where Tarantino shows how to ruin yet another story.

 What a pile of poop

 Al Sharpton could have written this script

 Paint dries faster

 Eperors New Clothes

 Unpleasant to the max and NOT entertaining in the least

 For me not the best but the weakest Tarantino

 21st century entertainment

 Don't waste your time.

 wwwhhyyyyyy

 Too prolonged...

 Making a joke of racism?

 Tarentino or "The Cartoon Western"

 Django or not
