 The biggest hammer on my toe ever!!!!

 Fell asleep towards the end, and I don't think it was an accident.

 Emotional pornography

 YAWN!!!!

 Is the the God-given gift of healing a fitting subject for sentimentality?

 Well told story full of racism

 Tear jerker

 Predictable (SPOILERS)

 acting si, story no

 A pretty good American movie of the 1990's

 Obvious, ham-fisted "spirituality"

 it's not that good

 Big disappointment

 THE MOVIE THAT WOULD NOT BE EDITED!!!

 L'empereur a besoin des kex

 Not as awful as everyone says, but...

 When a mouse upstages Tom Hanks, something ain't right...

 King's patented "Two-dimensional Character" development

 Long and hokey.
