 You are not as stupid as Christopher Nolan thinks you are.

 Like dangling a shiny toy in front of a cat.

 Many clever ideas ruined by a horrendously bad execution.

 Boring movie

 Age Old Metaphysical Question Wrapped In Cynical Package

 great idea, poor and shallow work and perfect for the majority

 Are you kidding me?

 A Dream within a Dream within a Dream within a Dream.

 Same old lame Hollywood tripe

 First Summary - The Kreisel of doom

 A whole lot of nothing

 Fancy graphics without much heart

 Amazing Special Effects

 Dazzles like cheap jewelery

 Vanilla sky + TNG's "The Inner Light" + Matrix effects = Inception

 Action movie overshadows concept

 Worst Film of 2010

 Nah

 more glitz than substance

 Extremely disappointed - This film is totally over-rated

 Too contrived

 Painful Experience

 Whew....I'm not stupid after all!

 The auteur of confusion...with apologies to James Cameron...(and Hindu mythology)

 Some nice effects, that's about all.
