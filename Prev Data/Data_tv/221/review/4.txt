After 16 years, I expected more of the same or a crescendo for the end. But it's just a massive letdown. Aku, the literal essence of evil now sounds like a rabi from NY, has self-doubts and just moans and whines all the time. His minions are nowhere to be seen except for one who is just stuck on "repeat' with the catch phrases. The scottish sidekick has 20+ daughters of the same age, the he dies, but not quite, and he has... magic bagpipes stronger than Aku's magic. /!\ Jack is an emotional wreck, lots of unnecessary drama about details but then he falls is love with a female assassin sent to kill him and they have... awkward moments. /!\ Good grief! In the age of cinematic reboots, even this has been plowed over in ordet to make a buck. The producers should've just let the it end with the original seasons. Utterly disappointing.
