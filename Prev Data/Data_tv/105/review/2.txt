New era, new version of Black-adder.Sadly this show didn't do a lot for me. I know, I know, it's a British institution and I feel I should love it because everyone else does, but sorry, I didn't.It's well written, I'll give you that, and well performed certainly, but comedy is subjective, and I can't remember laughing a lot at this brand of comedy.
