 Huge disappointment from 1st to 2nd Season

 Total disappointment

 Suffers the same fate of THE DEFENDERS

 Who is punishing who?

 Move over thomas jane you never had it anyways

 Somebody wake me when it's over...

 Disappointed

 Not a Mavel

 Too slow

 Sad, Bad and leaves you Mad: SPOILERS

 Promising series let down by sloppy writing and goofs

 What a monstrous mess

 Are the reviewers on here high or something?

 Dull and slow

 So they made Chuck Norris+Logan antihero series...

 Boring

 What a disappointment! I am a fan of the comic, read my review..

 Thanks feminism. You ruined another one

 Punisher without the punishing

 Bleh

 Enough

 OK for awhile

 Season one was good, but season 2 was junk
