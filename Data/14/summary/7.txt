 Too much....WAY too much

 Inception? No, implementation.

 Gimmicks For Sale

 Good but over long and not that clever

 9/10, really? Must be some sort of flocking behavior

 This Film Is Great, But Only In Some People's Dreams

 Interesting but overrated

 Desperately loved by stupid people who want to appear smart...

 Not A Dream

 What About It?

 Not even close to the acid trip the movie trailer was hinting

 Mr. Nolan is like a cold mathematician

 The Movie Hater strikes again

 7.3

 Intriguing premise devolves into same old, same old

 Inception is an epic and pure textbook movie

 Your mind is the scene of the crime

 Christopher Nolan continues his climb to the top... of the most overrated directors list

 Using difficult words don't make a good book.

 Meh, 7 out of 10. It was OK, not revolutionary

 Not living up to the hype...

 Just my take.

 Good but not what it's cracked up to be

 solid and enjoyable movie

 A Combination of the Matrix, Shutter Island and Memento
