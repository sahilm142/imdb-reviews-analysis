 and kept waiting....

 long, humorless film

 The Big Bust

 I just don't feel it !

 I don't understand why this is loved by so many!

 A total Coen Brothers misfire. I was bowled over by how bad it was.

 Slackers of the world unite

 A complete waste of time

 Every once in a while I see a film with a good vote..

 A waste of time...

 The Big LetDownski

 A retarded tale by a retarded duo

 The Big Disappointment

 Deeply deadening and very jejune = So damn Humorless.

 Don't watch this movie - read below before watching (No spoilers)

 I didn't "get" it.

 Boring, pretentious,and highly overated

 Good Actors/Bad Movie
