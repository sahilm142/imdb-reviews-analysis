 Definitive teen coming-of-age drama - NOT a comedy!

 What Happened to Lardass?

 Kid Comradery

 A film need not be expensive to be Great

 Good; one of the best King adaptions

 Coming-of-age drama from the pen of Stephen King

 Nice ride

 Affectionate enough tale of four youngsters discovering all kinds of strife and truths, under a canopy of highly delicate comedy and enjoyable characterisation.

 Truly sweet but a bit unoriginal

 Recommended

 Not as good as I expected, considering its reputation

 Kids Have Never Used This Many Expletives

 Economical and well-acted coming-of-age drama

 Sad but pretty good

 Fun trip back

 Friendship...

 Beautiful scenes with everlasting impression will trigger your memories

 Solid coming of age film but not a masterpiece by any means

 Great movie but I hate Rob Reiner.

 Stand By Me

 The Characters And Actors Who Play Them Are More Important Than The Story

 good mix of fun and drama

 River runs wild

 A film based in the 1950's that's a good coming of age story.

 Rediscovered the movie, rediscovered me
