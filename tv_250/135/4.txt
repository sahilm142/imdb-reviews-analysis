Not really a documentary and not as good as VH1's "Behind the Music" series. Comes closer to 'Real Housewives' reality television -- swap out housewives for moguls and you get the idea. This series felt like a vanity project that perpetuates the 'cult of personality' that the Dre/Iovine partnership trades on and Apple seems to need to exploit to lend credibility to all of the "Beats" product. Some amusing moments but all-in-all a disappointment.
