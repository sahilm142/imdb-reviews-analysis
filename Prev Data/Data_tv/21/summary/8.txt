 fantastic series

 FOX canceled this show and for that I hate FOX

 Cult hit deserves the praise

 Space cowboys

 Interesting Sci-Fi western by the folks who brought you buffy

 Move over Captain Kirk, Captain Spock, Han Solo ... there's a new cowboy in Town

 Our Mrs. Reynolds

 Joss Whedon's best work!

 An Action Packed Adventure that Finished before Entireiy Capturing its Potential,

 Learned its lesson too late

 What an awesome series!!!

 No, this show is not as good as its rating.
