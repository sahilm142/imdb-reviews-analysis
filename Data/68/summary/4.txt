 A glorification of the destruction of the American family.

 I refuse to believe this film won Best Picture!

 Trite feel-good for 40-something husbands

 Pretty bad movie for us kooky liberals, too...

 Beauty must be in the eye of the beholders

 Could have liked it . . .

 Strangely great

 I don't get it.

 1/4 of "The Ice Storm"

 I wanted so bad to love it.

 The end kills what could have been a great movie.

 Apparently the most widely over-appreciated film since 'The Piano'

 You're being had.

 So So, boring at times

 This movie so incredibly lacks subtlety, coherence...

 Don't believe the hype. Look closer. Angst lite.

 Definitely not a classic film

 Where's The Love??

 Of passing interest only

 Unbelievably bad...

 Confused???

 A nasty film, and unoriginal, but with enjoyable acting

 What's all the fuss about?

 Lame attempt at a message.

 what a letdown..
