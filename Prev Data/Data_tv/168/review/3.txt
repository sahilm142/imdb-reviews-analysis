This show is so slow, overrated and just plain bad! Whatever points I feel it deserves are for great shots by the camera team, the choice of shooting locations and some dialogue writing. The story looses grip every now and then, any loose ends just left, the lead actress is just bad, the character is written so annoying and her acting chops don't help in anyway to make it bearable.Bad! Just bad! Am surprised at the n number of recommendations for this show at various platforms.
