My wife and I went to see this at a special showing at the university where I was a professor. Dana Andrews, before being diagnosed with Alzheimer's, came to give a little talk before the showing. All I can say is the movie stank big time. It's the kind of movie about which people say, "They don't make them like that anymore," to which I say, "Thank God." We found it terminally slow, unbelievable, and poorly acted. Need I say more?


                
This movie is so overrated and so boring. It just is about 7 or 8 old men mumbling and talking in a dull monotone voice about their boring lives. On top of that the movie is like 3 and half hours long and you will be keeping your finger on the fast forward hoping that this crap gets finished as soon as possible that is of course if you haven't turned it off by then and it has no good actors that you have ever heard of in it. i promise you that you will not know the definition of boring until you watch this film. The actors are all lame in playing the part and the fat guy looked like he was just sleep walking his way through the part. How can people love this film unless they are an old hunchback man with grey hair. when i put on this movie i was expecting it to be about 1 and half hours and i looked on my DVD timer and saw it had about 2 and half hours left! If you watch this film and need to go to the toilet don't worry about missing anything important. you won't.
