 Unique, but extreme, preachy, and overrated film

 Cocaine Pi

 Drugstore Cowboy did it better...

 A Frenetic, Visually Stunning Addition to Film History

 Don't do drugs. No, really.

 Important message,weak movie

 Must watch, but only ONCE

 overrated...

 bad accent, glamourizing, too many cuts, gratuity, deja vu, no point, whatever. give the movie a break.

 Stunning

 .....haunting the viewer long after the final fade.

 Film-making tour de force, but where's the character development?

 How depressing

 I enjoyed it. I think

 Definitely not for everyone

 Brash and up-front depiction of an array of people and their connecting with varying forms of drugs; an ambitious piece which works really well.

 Requiem for a Dream studies the various types of addictions in life

 Old fashioned morality play reworked for the hip-hop generation.

 A Powerful tell-all film

 Best movie not to watch

 Best reality-punch film I have seen, probably ever

 technically brilliant, otherwise mediocre

 depressing.

 Lou Reed copied well

 A better-than-words sensory explosion.
