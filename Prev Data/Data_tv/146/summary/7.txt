 suspense-packed, dark & mysterious but character overloaded & confusing

 Pretentious

 Lost things

 Well made dark sc-fi with a repetitive storyline

 A very good German thriller

 Slow, Original, but not for everyone.

 A good show with potential

 Very engaging thriller albeit leading to a cliched Season 1 Finale

 Better than Stranger Things, but...

 Moderately passable acting but fantastic soundtrack and cinematography

 No smart people anymore

 Good but not as good as Stranger Things
