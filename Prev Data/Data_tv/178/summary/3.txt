 "The Handmaid's Snail"

 Slow. long winded, dreadful.

 Elizabeth Moss's vanity piece endlessly dragged out.

 Yeap I put it a three...

 A tacky and disappointing adaption of a compelling novel

 What a boring drag

 Perfect for Sleeping

 Beautifully Shot - Dully Acted

 Season 1 = Amazing! Season 2 = boring. Season 3 = a disaster

 Loved Season 1, Season 2 is terrible

 Boring, slow and predictable

 Slowest series ever

 Really dumb TV

 Great idea, poor casting

 Poor casting, pale in comparison to the movie version

 Blinded By The Dark...

 Wrong Religion represented

 How to take a story that was decent despite itself and make it less so...

 Creepy

 Well... this is sh#$t.

 Waste of time

 so many wasted potentials
