 A Hell of a place to make your fortune...

 Welcome to f*cking Deadwood!

 "A hell of a place to make your fortune"

 Fantastic, take a bow!!

 HBO's Finest Hour

 Probably one of the best written, acted, and produced shows. Ever.

 My All Time Favorite

 HBO's Latest Masterpiece, A Down and Dirty, Brilliant and Bold Western that Will Blow You Away!

 Fantastic!

 Wonderful drama

 More historically accurate than most seem to realize

 HBO are way ahead of everyone else

 A fascinating show...

 Best Western ever!!!!

 Superb!

 Stunningly memorable

 Deadwood is probably the greatest Western

 Wish it would have continued

 first rate, compassionate storytelling and superb acting.

 In a sea of bad, this is a real gold strike...

 Deadwood delivers the real Wild West.

 Deadicated to Deadwood

 The most intense show I have seen for years!
