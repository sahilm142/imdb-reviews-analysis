 Outstanding Beginning, Disappointing Finish

 Captivating

 reimagining of the shirley jackson book

 Don't get all the 10/10 or 9s or 8s or 7s.....

 9 out of ten episodes are great

 9 great episodes, 1 bad finale

 I struggled with who was who

 Like Castaway.

 Really liked the series, HATED the ending

 Oh yeah Watch it, but there will be a betrayal

 Very different from the original, but almost as brilliant

 Trauma, terror, horror and emotion. If you accept the adaptation its damn good. But if you expect the original by Jackson, tread lightly near the end. .

 9 1/2 episodes great, 1/2 not so great

 I loved it... BUT

 Okay! The Ghost of the christmas Past Revisted

 Perfect 8/10 episodes

 Red Door Disappointment

 A Good Show, but nothing much to do with the original book.

 Without last episode it would be10/10

 You should really watch it

 Not scary but good

 Pleasantly Surprised, Nice Halloween Season Viewing

 Netflix finally made good progress on Horror stories. Proud!

 Surely impresses the horror fans..

 Really Scary...Perfect Jump Scares...Interesting Ending
