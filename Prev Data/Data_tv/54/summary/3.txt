 Westworld - 2nd Season - A Complete Mess

 Its full of nonesense

 Pants

 Devolves into bs

 Season 1 was great, season 2 a snooze fest

 Season one was fantastic, 3 stars is for season 2

 2nd season is extremely boring.

 Watch Season.1 and pretend Season 2 was never made.

 A wasted opportunity - a plot so thin you could use it as a window

 Something very wrong

 Westworld - Don't forget to clear your cache

 Season One was good, Season Two is a train wreck

 Lazy Writing

 Hot Mess World

 I am getting confused

 Looking forward to this

 I am disappointed .

 Tedious, repetitive, ugh

 I guess I don't get the attraction

 1st season was awesome, 2nd sucks hard.

 Enough of the back story please!

 Promising start of Season 1, now just slow burner hodgepodge with high production value.

 It insists upon itself.

 Season 2

 Does this series have an editor?
