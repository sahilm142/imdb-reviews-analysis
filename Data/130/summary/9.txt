 Life as it is...

 Great acting in an entertaining drama

 The Mediterrenean way of life..

 great movie

 Warm and human

 excellent

 melancholy and vigorous emotion

 Did we have to wait that long to make a decent movie on our "coup d'etats"?

 A story of Turkish people

 The story is very deep

 Tends to exploit basic and common human feelings.Otherwise powerful.

 Relevant and touching

 mopey story and family relationship

 Easy and deeply impressive
