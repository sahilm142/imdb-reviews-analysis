First of all let me say that Louie C.K. is an excellent comedian. It's never easy for a stand-up comedian to get full attention of the whole audience but he manages to get it easily. The two little girls, Hadley Delany and Ursula Parker, that play his daughters Lilly and Jane are very good as well. Especially the youngest one Jane. The first season was to me the best one with a lot of humor on day to day topics. The second and third season are good as well but with fewer jokes but still it is enjoyable to watch. But with the fourth season I don't know where he is going. It's less funny and I really hope he gets back like the first season otherwise I might just skip watching it.
