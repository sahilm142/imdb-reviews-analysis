 blah blah blah

 Cliché, boring and no chemistry

 Gag them with a spoon

 Omg! Shut!!! Up!!! already

 My Least Favorite Movie Ever

 The most tortuously boring movie to be made in the 90's

 Adverse selection

 Totally lack of taste after all that great love stories..

 Incomprehensible

 nothing to spoil

 I barely survived.

 Seen it before, once is enough!

 Don't waste your money

 Give me my one hour and half back please!!

 Gag them with a spoon

 Spare us the torture
