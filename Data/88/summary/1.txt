 Don't believe the hype-

 Overrated tripe

 Kubrick's "Black Square"

 When Art Attacks

 Drivel

 2001: A Cure for Insomnia

 Great to Look at, but...

 Extremely boring

 Complete Waste of Time

 Amazingly boring

 Utter crap

 Don't be fooled. The emperor is naked. And a total fraud.

 Great visuals but little more

 just about the most awful movie ever made

 I watched 50% of this movie on Fast-Forward!

 Dumb Founded

 It was all I could do to stay awake

 Typical Bloated Kubrick Nonsense About Absolutely Nothing

 Masterpiece-of-crap

 The very worst (philosophically speaking)

 Overrated and outdated

 This is possibly the worst film in history.........

 Don't believe the hype...

 Uhh...

 Worst Movie Of The Century
