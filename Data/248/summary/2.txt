 A Sublime Shade of Red

 Prospero and the Magickal Storm of Coincidence.

 Not a goof

 Beautiful, mysterious, and unusual love story

 A masterwork

 The final chapter in a flawless saga

 Bring your brain

 Krzysztof Kieslowski's Testament

 The Film I Will Always Remember Krzysztof Kieslowski For.

 Perhaps the most philosophically dense film ever made

 Incredible..A Work of Art...Stellar Finale for the Best Trilogy of Alltime!

 Kieslowski a masterful painter in Blue, White and Red: see all three!

 My favourite film

 The Best

 Reasonably intriguing, but slow-moving with a trite ending

 Beautiful. Outstanding.The movie from the 90's

 The Folded Present

 The most complex of the three, and the top one

 This one's for real movie-lovers!

 Truly amazing

 wonderful

 one of the best and most beautiful movies I know

 What can I say that hasn't been said?

 Gives meaning to the word Excellent

 What a way to make a movie.
