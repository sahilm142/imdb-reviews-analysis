 Overrated, inappropriately directed and tediously boring

 A Rat In The Attic

 What's all hype about???

 In space...no one can hear your funny parody of the original tagline.

 very slow and boring

 BOO-HISS-HISS-BOO!!!

 the words amazing and stupefying don't define this movie; the words stupid and dull do

 Worst movie ever seen

 CUT!

 Ugliness personified
