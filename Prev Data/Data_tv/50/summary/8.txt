 Netflix's Foray into Original Programming is off to a Promising Start

 Delicious plot, cast, and design

 It used to be by far my favorite series

 Brilliant provided that you miss season 6 train wreck

 Season 6 is worse than you thought it would be !!

 Why season 3 is a complete failure, but not the first 2 seasons

 IF you like Politics,Power and Drama watch this now !!

 My 8 stars were for seasons 1-5

 6th against five good..

 Amazing Show- Died without KS

 Television of the Future: Brilliant Political Drama

 Wow<U+0085>

 Don't believe IMDB-s lies. This series only have 5 season

 The dark side of politics

 10/10 for the First Two Seasons

 Series died with Spacey's departure

 Early seasons are entertaining but becomes slow by the 5th

 A decent view of the political structure of the US

 Season 6 reviews IMPOSSIBLY low

 First Episode sets the hook

 Season six should be called Slow Death.

 Engaging Retake of a British Television Classic

 8.5

 It should have ended 2 seasons earlier

 S6: Please, it's not just Franks departure!
