This movie tries so hard to display the hardships of training to be a musician that the whole image shifts into simple physical and mental abuse of human beings, in this case teenagers. As another reviewer said: it is the boot camp of music. I did not believe what I was seeing. If there was a movie where some dog-whisperer is hitting the dog and yelling at it and this would prove to be working as a method to 'educate' the dog, then people would be upset. But treating a human like that is OK? this just sickens me. yes, you can get humans to do some things by pushing them with violence. Get them into an obedient state of mind, that is simply following orders. But there is a reason why this strategy of motivation has proved to be only effective in the military: There, human lives are indeed worthless. This treatment will make you 'harder', meaning it will make you less of a human being.When it comes to music however it is impossible to achieve great results with these methods. It can only lead to a soul- and heartless disaster. A fitting result would have been an aggression build-up in the main character which would have prevented him from ever playing anything worth listening to again. This reaction has been seen in other movies where usually the people that are socially connected to the main character will have to suffer from the violent state of mind that this mistreatment is causing. The other possibility is a simple resignation, either by quitting music or by quitting life.But what is displayed here is wrong on many levels, because it tells you that this abuse leads to something beautiful. That it is all worth it because it pushes you to your limits and then you will be a great musician. Whoever made up this story is either suffering from a severe psychosis or has the intent to justify abusive methods in education by presenting them as effective.If you treat people with violence they will get violent too. Either towards others or towards themselves. This is the only result you will achieve. And in this case it would also completely destroy the main character's ability to be a musician. Music is not the military. You do need discipline and training, but this comes from mental strength. And you do not get stronger by being abused. It will only weaken you.It makes me sad seeing that apparently this movie is entertaining to people. This can only be the case if they do not see the utter failure in judgment that is presented here. And if they do not see it then they are blind in a way that is worrying.
I gave it 28 minutes. That was generous, in that I knew it was going to be terrible within about 2.I've been to music school. It's not like this. The teachers aren't like this. No one's like this (obviously I'm referring to 'Hollywood idea of what a hard-ass music teacher might be like in some weird juvenile negative fantasy' Fletcher).I switched off when he threw a chair at Andrew the drum prodigy and then slapped him. SLAPPED him. Repeatedly. In front of a whole, cowed class of what, in legal terms, would be called witnesses to an assault, for playing slightly fast, the first time he's ever played to him in a band practice.I'm sorry, what?! Where does this/would this/has this ever happened? In a Charles Dickens novel about a jazz drum student, possibly. In anything even vaguely purporting to be based on real life now, um...No.I'm stunned. Yet another IMDb/Metacritic/Rotten Tomatoes gush-fest that is so laughably bad, you have to check the page again to really believe it's got such high praise.Excruciating nonsense.
I find it very sad that so many people - including so-called professional reviewers - have rated this crap so highly. I did not walk out (although I was greatly tempted to do so) but saw it to the end. A total waste of time.Here's what might spoil it for you, should you believe the BS that's being spread around this stinking pile of excrement: It could have actually been OK if it hadn't been so laughably impossibly ridiculous. Perhaps if it had been set in the fifties or the forties when people had much less developed consciousness of human rights? But even so... I suppose the moral/lesson we are supposed to learn is... if you can't warp your students enough by abuse to force them to become great musicians then it is perfectly alright to discard or destroy them in the attempt. This glorified tyrant and bully can himself only produce music at a grade one level and so because he cannot 'do' he 'teaches?'He does not teach, he does not inspire; he withholds approval, negatively reinforces and rules by fear, and is feared rather than respected. I would have a difficult time to point to a single (pedagogical) scene in the film that had any merit whatsoever or was worth watching for any reason. Maybe I should say that its evident popularity may be evidence that we are truly living in the end times... ha! See the film if you want to be current, but please decide for yourself from watching it and don't believe the hype about its 'genius' or 'brilliance.' It is not either of those things; it's a poorly written, sad joke.
If you are a believer in the clichéd notion that success can only come from obsessive dedication to the exclusion of all normal human interaction, coupled with mountains of degradation, suffering, humiliation, and physical torture, you will absolutely adore this worthless pile of clichés, stereotypes, and bankrupt cinematic ideas. The story of a young jazz drummer who is brutalized by a sadistic teacher in the interests of spurring him to greatness is one of the most repulsive exercises in sheer idiocy ever committed to the screen. I watched and watched, waiting for some valid point to emerge from scenes of torment, bleeding hands, broken relationships, hideous nastiness and all the rest, but in the end, all we get is a whopping nonsensical cliché that only a fool could buy into. J.K. Simmons (the psychologist from Law and Order) does a credible job as the sadistic teacher, but honestly, no one could do much with a part this stereotypical... he couldn't have been more villainous unless he had a mustache to twirl. And the rest of the cast doesn't do any better with their phony baloney parts. Folks, if you don't have a credible story based in some form of recognizable and believable reality, nothing else matters. The fact that this one gets such a high rating on IMDb proves that HL Mencken was right: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.
First of all, English is not my mother tongue. Excuse me for the mistake I made in this review.Every one seems to like this movie. It is weird that many people seems to avoid to talk about the message or don't think this movie have any massage at all. But for me the message is loud and clear: You must Insult, humiliate, mentally abuse and physically violate your student to make them good. That's the only way to encourage them to achieve greatness. As a student you must take any advantage you can, no matter what it is going to cause. Remove everything except the thing you want to master from your life FOREVER, otherwise you are not going to be successful. There are lots of things in the movie that state these message clearly. The most obvious one is the ending. Both Andrew and Fletcher achieve their goal. They achieve it beautifully. Andrew did a improvisation at the end and create his own music. Fletcher get his Charlie Parker. Detail like the poster in the school, says something about end up in a rock band. The fame of Fletcher's band in the movie. Every single effect that Fletcher occur to Andrew like in a scene, Andrew describe other drummer's performance as this s**t. Some information that state the disadvantage of Fletcher's way of teaching are blurred out. such as the Death of a student that I forget his name. Student that Fletcher send out the classroom are never seen again. Fletcher's impact to other student. Those information mentioned in the movie disappear immediately. People who find these message and buying them certainly never been through a teacher like Fletcher or at least doesn't been through for a long time. I jump to this conclusion because I did, and I know what kind of damage Fletcher's way of education will do to the student for a long period of time. When I was about 10 years old, I had not one but three teacher just like Fletcher for two years. I was in my primary school back in China. Violence is the most usual way of their punishment. we got beaten after we didn't do very well on homework, misbehave on class (usually talking and not paying attention), I once broke my arm during these days. At the time I actually like they use violence, because nothing come close when they decided not to use it. When they insult you they never run short of fancy words even we are just kids. I hope I translate them more correctly so you can understand them better. Ones I have a classmate that didn't do well on their homework about handwriting. The teacher says these word in front of 46 kid: From now on, your name is piece of s**t (my classmate's last name) because your handwriting is s**t. and your parents are big s**t. they should be regret about f**k 10 month before your birthday, because you are not worth it. That is one of the thing they said that I remember the most. and after that, little s**t become his nick name. he accept it and we make fun of it.And humiliation . that is for every one who didn't "do well" on their test. Every morning before class. A question well be asked to everyone in the class:"who is the one that get the lowest score?" after that the kid that get the lowest score will be forced to say:"I am a worthless piece of crap, everything I know is to eat and s**t."If any of these thing don't make you think about Fletcher, I don't know what will. In fact I fell Fletcher is a saint compare to them. because those kind of torture last 2 years long and I was a 10 year old kid.Here come the worst part.At first those insult works very well. After a long time I start to accept every word they say. Remember I said my classmate accept his nickname little s**t. I start to accept I am a idiot, I cant do anything right, I am worthless and pathetic. Those word don't make me fell I am willing to break the barrier any more. instead they become a relief. An excuse for not doing well. After over 10, I sometime still fell the same way. I find a psychological statement that describe it very well called Learned helplessness. I am no psychologist so someone please tell me if it's true or not.Back to the movie review. I don't think Andrew is making any sense according to my experience. And this movie is a training course for a**holes. 1/10 Good Job for harming the director the most.
It amazes me that a movie that promotes such level of fascistic perfectionism gets so much praise. I say fascistic because the sick perfectionism of Nazis was one of the main reasons they thought it is OK to gas millions of people. If you are not perfect based on our standards you don't deserve to live. This movie tells us if you are not Charlie Parker I feel free to humiliate you, insult you, hurt you and abuse you, and it is all justified because if you are Charlie Parker you don't mind this level of sick manipulation. What a disgusting message. Yes, the actors did a good job playing these sick characters, and the movie was well made, which makes it even more dangerous.
I was very surprised to see this movie do so well at the Oscars. The movie in a nutshell, to me, is exactly how NOT to teach anyone anything. The story walks you through a jazz class with a Drill Sergeant for a teacher that physically and verbally abuses his student in the name of greatness. The key message is being supportive, respectful and compassionate will get you nowhere. Hitting, abusing and destroying people will make your great! Hollywood for years has been advocating against bullying and now they give not one but three Oscar to a movie that glorifies Bullying??!! I was dumbfounded and sad. Yes, the performance s are great and the actors are very good, but no degree of acting should justify glorifying this method of teaching. What I hated most was that the movie made me like Jazz less. If this is what it takes to have great Jazz musicians then we do not need Jazz. Just to be clear. Hitting, screaming, psychological warfare, abuse and negativity DO not create great people or better musicians. They create abusive, disrespectful human beings that will continue the hate and the abuse. No wonder suicide rates for young people are high; if you are not good enough you are not worth playing, studying, living, etc. Just kill yourself. A very bad message to kids, students and teachers. Dreadful, Hollywood should be ashamed.
Take a cheezy D-list sports movie script complete with the cliché bullying, demeaning coach with the tormented, misunderstood athlete (reality: narcissistic, self-righteous, arrogant, spoiled and immature child who needs to grow up) -- replace these 2 characters with a jazz music "teacher" and a drum student at an "elite" music academy. Neither character has ANY redeeming qualities - if the writers thought they were creating complex, intricate characters they failed miserably. The ending only shows how pathetic both truly are. I assume the writers (and anyone giving this film a positive review) felt they reached some great epiphany at the conclusion - they didn't. Only a tired out re-tread storyline completely out of proper context. A jazz drum student and music "teacher" are not soldiers in boot camp and learning to play drums is not a physically demanding, super- human endeavor as this film tries to lead you to believe.In reality the "teacher" is a glorified conductor who thinks he's something special but does nothing but destroy his students desire and passion. He is also an admitted complete failure at his misguided goal of creating another Charlie Parker. The "student" is equally self-absorbed and rude excuse for a human being. Only thing positive is he seems to be a pretty decent jazz drummer - but that's it. Character has absolutely ZERO going for him other than that. Other than that he's completely disrespectful and dismissive of everything and everyone else.This film (along with Birdman) sums up how pretentious Hollywood is and the excrement they promote at awards shows to convince themselves they have some higher "intellect" or "artistic genius." No one will remember Whiplash or Birdman other than as an embarrassing side note in Oscar history (remember Shakespeare in Love, didn't think so - Google it).
Whiplash is a terrible, unrealistic movie. First of all, of all the musical forms in popular culture, Jazz is one of the most relaxed and organic. The fact that the music director is characterized as disciplinarian is reminiscent of the "classical" genre of 60+ year ago (Toscanini, Bruno Walter, etc.), where musical directors ruled with an almost fascist like iron fist. This changed years ago in "classical" music and was NEVER the case in Jazz. I am a former professional Jazz and classical musician who studied at top music schools, and creating great Jazz is about relaxing and being in the moment, not being frightened to the point of crying because of an evil music director.Secondly, within the first 20 minutes of the movie, the music director throws a chair at the student and then slaps him!! This is called ASSAULT, and would NEVER happen (or more to the point, be tolerated), in any academic institution, minor or major! Certainly not in the US (or in New York City, as in this case.) This alone completely discredits this movie in my opinion. It's an unrealistic piece of crap that should not ever had been made!! This movie is a discredit to the beautiful art form that is Jazz and an insult to all who teach and play it.


                
Homophobic and antisemitic insults, psychological and physical torture presented as working methods to motivate a teenager! Do I really need to write more to express how wrong this movie is, despite all the good acting and amazing editing? Since when geniuses and talented artists have all been mentored by a sadistic psychotic maniac that should be locked up straight from the very first slap or insults? it is a SCHOOL. S-C-H-O-O-L.An insult to all worthy teachers and mentors more successful than this Fletcher as NONE of their trainees kill themselves and nevertheless do reach their best.Liking this movie with no restriction at all is being an accomplice of teen suicides.
I'm giving Whiplash a one star rating to compensate for all the rave reviews it has gotten from people who obviously know nothing about about how music is made, and what goes into great performances.Almost the whole film is about the relationship between a talented teen drummer, played by Miles Teller and a teacher, played by JK Simmons, who directs jazz in a top music school. The JK Simmons role is a sick meld of an evil Nazi from WWII, a brutal drill sergeant and a father who is both physically and mentally abusive. His head is shaved, he wears a black "muscle" shirt almost continually in the movie, he screams at his students, uses language that makes George Carlin seem like Mr. Rogers, throws chairs, and finally slaps the Teller character in the face, repeatedly. I don't think there is a minority group he does not insult repeatedly, with just about the worst four-letter trash talk imaginable.The fact that the acting is impressive can't save this film. The script is terrible. And it does a disservice to music education in a time when support for the arts is already struggling.Worst of all, the film misrepresents everything that is real in both music and music education. Anyone seeing this film and thinking of going into a music program for the first time would be so turned-off The film is about mind-rape. It is about the worst kind of damage one human can inflict on another in the name of teaching without leaving a great deal of physical damage. It has nothing to do with music, or creativity, or teaching. It is Hollywood at its worse.There are some abusive musical directors who have way too much power, but this fictional character would not last one week in any music school. One student would simply turn on an I-pad, record what goes on, then pass it around.The teacher would be out of a job and most likely in jail.One reviewer called it a "steaming pile of excrement". Apt words.


                
There's only one thing worse than a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie, and that's a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie that everybody seems to adore.Whiplash wants to be about the love of great art, but is actually about the hate of great art. It has JK Simmons - a brilliant actor - playing a disgraceful character, stitched together from completely unrealistic, inconsistent motivations and actions, only conceived to bludgeon the viewer into thinking we're watching something profound. It casually tosses in assault, depression and suicide in a way that only a clueless, opportunistic director could. It has a big finale that would be powerful if only it made some sense for the main characters involved - it doesn't.Even worse, the finale leaves us with this unmistakable message: sadistic leadership is the way to greatness. Don't take your kids to see this.


                
I laughed my head off at every scene in this movie! It was hilarious! The whole thing reminded me of an SCTV skit. I expected John Candy or Martin Short to come out at any second throughout the entire movie. Now I know why musicians and music students are making fun of this movie all over the US. I was a HS music teacher for more than 15 years, and a professional musician my entire life, and I've never seen a funnier movie about music in my entire life. The only one that came close to this was Ken Russell's version of "Tommy", but Whiplash took itself much more seriously than Tommy did. People are getting more and more brainless about music every day (especially jazz), so it didn't surprise me that many people thought this was a good movie. I guess I'm not as angry about how bad this piece of garbage was compared to the other people that gave it a bad review, because I waited for it to come out on DVD, and didn't waste a lot of money seeing it in a theater. This would make a great feature on Mystery Science Theater 3000 it's so bad!
(Only mild, generalized spoilers ahead, do not worry.) I have played the drums in a Big Band for over 15 years, from my teenage years until well into adulthood. 90% of the time with another drummer, sharing duties. Which is exactly the scenario here, so naturally, i was intrigued by this movie. And it started off promising. A young drummer is eventually invited to practice with a prestigious Big Band. Many of the little details depicted here are pretty much on point.But i cannot begin to describe my disappointment in what unfolded on the screen. The drummer and the band leader (and even the other band members) display such sorry behavior that it becomes tough to endure. You want to raise your voice to the band leader, in place of the drummer and other band members, who fail miserably to stand up for themselves. Instead, you have to endure scenes of bullying and manipulation, and people taking it lying down, like prison inmates going through a boot camp.Only the behavior shown here is worse. The people in this movie are not desperately trying to reduce the length of their prison sentence. Instead, they are desperate for acceptance, for approval, for prestige, for fame. They accept humiliation, they accept being put down, and they do not stand up for themselves. On the contrary. They think that this is alright. They have embodied the whole twisted concept of it all. A society where striving for fame and for outside approval beats any sort of moral values. But shouldn't these values be the most important? To think for yourself and to stand up for yourself, to have values and to defend your values, when people try to coerce you, manipulate you or attack you? But we see people that were brainwashed enough to play along with this farce. Worse, to even support it in a way.If this wasn't troubling enough, what also puzzles me is the overwhelming praise this movie gets by critics and viewers alike. Have we really become so morally degenerated and cynical that this sort of story is now worthy of the IMDb Top 100 Greatest movies of all time? Let me clarify, my objection is not about the production values, the actors (well, a bit), the camera-work or anything like that. It's about the story that's being told, which is the most important part by far, after all.Another thing: This is supposed to depict the act of playing music together, which should be a joyful thing. Playing in a band is a celebration, a give-and-take between the players, an almost sacred and highly social interaction. And a band leader is good when he gives advice, not critique. When he develops people instead of using people. When he motivates instead of manipulating. When he inspires enthusiasm instead of fear. When he is leading, not bossing around. In this movie, they get everything wrong.Overall, i'm thoroughly disappointed with this movie on several levels. I reluctantly have to give this Top 100 movie the lowest score, simply due to the overwhelming urge it gave me to stop watching it.
Seems to me the only people who like this movie are people who know nothing about music. The film tries to get you to buy into some kind of polished, elite fantasy world that supports our belief that success comes at great sacrifice. Which it sometimes does.. but this movie is absolutely ridiculous.People become musicians out of LOVE for the art. They aren't pushed to "achieve greatness" by sadistic asshole teachers. Also, Jazz is far less rigorous and robotic than this movie would have you believe. Jazz (and Blues) have always been about self-expression - play, spontaneity, colour, contrast & emotion. Lots of great jazz players are self- taught and never even went to music school (see Django Reinhardt). Many can't even read music.This (American) movie completely fails to understand one of Americas own greatest cultural exports. As a Brit, I appreciate the irony - I can only conclude the writer must be a total dipshit.


                
I cannot believe that this film has received so many good reviews. I cannot believe that this film was Oscar nominated for "Best Motion Picture of the Year". Here's IMDb's synopsis of the film: "A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential." This film, however, is about a bully music teacher who insults, assaults, slaps, degrades, and humiliates his students to death. Literally. This film is realistic only in the sense that it depicts the catastrophic effects bullying can have on people's well-being. Everything else in the film would simply not happen. Other reviewers, with music knowledge, have explained why such music institutions and teaching practices and methods are implausible, nowadays. I am a psychologist and I can verify that bullying will not and cannot motivate a person to become greater. Peoples' potentials are most likely to be crushed as a consequence of bullying. Victims of bullying do not easily "overcome" or "harden up" to become better human beings. Moreover, victims of bullying tend to become bullies themselves, later on in life. So, I would claim that this is a film about the making of a bully.I am a big fan on violent films and I have felt emotionally exhilarated  completely satisfied  after watching films like Oldboy, and Sympathy for Mr & Lady Vengeance. Whiplash left me feeling disgusted, wondering about what kind of people made it, watched it, and enjoyed it.


                
I admired the cinematography and the acting, and at the start, thought this would be a great film. But then the bullying and violence started... The first episode was shocking but gripping, and I wanted to find out where the film was leading. It turned out to be leading up a blind alley. The sadistic teacher was a ridiculous stereotype, the bleeding hands were just plain unbelievable, and all the other members of the band just sat around watching but not reacting to the appalling abuse. This method of 'teaching' wouldn't work; there is a big difference between pushing students to achieve more and violent bullying. And the idea that such violence and aggression could lead to students producing better music of all things, would be laughable if it wasn't so sick. I was tempted to walk out but watched till the end, hoping for some kind of balance or note of realism. Unfortunately, there wasn't one and the final triumphant performance merely seemed to validate the cruelty. Yes, the cinema audience clapped at the end, and that made my stomach turn.
On the face of it this is an over the top unrealistic portrayal of the odd subject matter where a coach drives his charge to the limit. But that message gets a little confused as the movie progresses.... is he just psycho? Pretty typical of a lot of movies being churned out of the US these days relying an sensational exaggeration and graphic language rather than a good story. The drumming was poor and the drummer no Phil Collins. The general public in the US must be so gung-ho to accept this drivel.... if all you have to be is a loud mouth abusive jerk to get an Oscar then I give up. I warn you... if you have any taste at all you will be disappointed!
Throwing a chair, slapping a music student repeatedly in front of his class in rehearsal simply because the teacher doesn't know how to teach rhythm. This movie brings the art of music down to the level of sports sadly. There are already enough bad teachers out there, we don't need a training film for them. The guy isn't a "hard teacher", he's just an asshole. Anyone knows that a good teacher can solve simple problems like this very quickly and knows that hitting a student isn't the answer. But this screenplay is an amateur work and sought out this method to evoke drama than showing someone who was a real teacher who was passionate about the craft and found a better way to work with students. But hey, showing a kid get slapped around gets you off, then this hazing film is for you. It's sure to play on your Picure-in-Picture along side wresting with you and your buddies pausing to say, "Wait...watch this..." and the kid gets slapped and they all say, "awesome!" and have another beer. Too bad IMDb doesn't allow zero stars. Who green-lighted this project, someone's family have a lot of money to fund it? Who's paying for all this over the top reviews of this piece of trash?


                
Filmmakers have paid for positive reviews for decades before IMDb, and I can't think of a way for IMDb to protect against false or paid input.Consider with WHIPLASH, this film proved nothing but limp at the box office, not to be found anywhere in the top 100 for 2014, yet there are 176,500 votes for it on IMDb and most are for 10, 9, or 8.Then consider this is unoriginal, badly acted, boring film.The hero wants to be the World's #1 musician. Fine! So he gets J V Simmons to scream obscene language in his face and plays his drums until his hands bleed (Ridiculous!) Let me tell you about course language. Any idiot can excel at it. King size fools like the J V Simmons character have nothing else to offer; else-wise they could communicate without it.The boy still goes to the movies with his Dad. Sweet! At the movies they distinguish themselves by adding Milk Duds to the large tub of popcorn and blabbing through the show, making other people move away.Later, he masters the courage to date the pop corn girl and takes her for pizza. Wow! This adds substance to the later scene when he dumps her because he needs the time for his music.There is just nothing original or interesting going on here.Whiplash is one of the very worst films of 2014. IMDb would be so much better if it was kept honest and clean. I hope the producers enjoyed the $1.60 we paid to rent the DVD, but next time I'll think twice before choosing anything from Sundance.
I can't believe that people rate this movie so highly and I can't believe that this crap was nominated as Best Picture of the Year. All I can say is that I am so glad it didn't win. I'm not even sure I am glad that J.K. Simmons won an Oscar. This movie is bad from beginning to end and totally unbelievable. I'm not a musician and I don't even like Jazz, but I'm sure no music school would employ or tolerate a teacher like Fletcher. People would report him much sooner than it is portrayed in the movie. There are other scenes that discredit this film. For instance, when Andrew, the student, has the auto accident, he walks away from it with hardly any injury (although the car overturned) and makes it just in time to the music hall for the concert. Yeah, give me a break! Fletcher is a sadistic prick, but we are supposed to believe he is moved to tears when he talks about a former student who killed himself? Total nonsense! What really irritated me is that the Fletcher character is so surreal and disgusting, and that Andrew, the student, is so obsessed. Any normal person would have quit or at least reported the teacher, but no, we have to endure this "drama" until the "glorious" end. I found the solo so boring, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I only went to see this horrible film because it was nominated as best picture. I praise all the brave people who wrote a bad review... this movie deserves it.
It's not as boring as 50 Shades of Grey, but it's just about as simplistic. There are two characters, plus a couple of others are hinted (at with several seconds of screen time).I loved the music. The acting was good, but the roles were not especially nuanced.The main problem is that within the first couple of minutes of the film, you know Andrew's goal: to be an elite drummer. Great. You also realize that his instructor is complete jerk (or worse) and is going to "challenge" Andrew. So, for the rest of the movie, all we have to wonder about is whether he'll end up overcoming the challenge and being a good drummer, or whether he'll give up.It kept my attention, but I would never watch this movie a second time. There just wasn't enough substance to it. There was no nuance. There was nothing more to think about.The pseudo-philosophical, pop-psychological discussion in the movie about whether abusive treatment by a teacher is justifiable by the potential for producing greatness are just pathetic and empty.There are some shades of side-story. There's a paper-thin character of a girlfriend. She only exists to make us believe that Andrew might be giving something up by pursuing his goal, but since Andrew isn't likable at all, I didn't really care if he ended up with her.Anyway, the movie wasn't really a 1 star... I give it a solid 6.5, but since it's been voted so high here on IMDb, I'm just trying to bring it down into the realm of reality.


                
Having spent most of my entire life in music playing drums and teaching the art, I can tell you that there are so many things wrong with this movie, it's laughable. The absurd, over-the-top, face-slapping scene in the trailer was enough for me to avoid seeing it. But, at the urging of a friend - a non-musician who thought it was "great", I caved in to my curiosity. His taste in movies aside, he's still my friend, and I was right in my initial judgement. Watching the entire movie was a waste - I made it half-way through and ditched."Whiplash" is an unadulterated load of crap.


                
If this were to be a parody about success and how to achieve it, it would receive 10 stars from me. Unfortunately it is not and the high ratings it has achieved baffles me.Firstly, let me state that I do not understand music from a professional or enthusiast's point of view.In my opinion, the movie portrays music as a mastery of some technical skills, following a fixed(or slight variation thereof) tempo. It removes anything remotely positive involved in learning or teaching music. The main characters throughout the movie were only involved in inflicting pain on themselves or others in order to satisfy their ambitions.Secondly, no character development or a back story. All the characters came out the same at the end of the movie as they were in the beginning. The only change being Andrew could play better(yippe!).Thirdly, definition of success (of being a 'Great') and the path to it. The movie portrays success as a neurotic obsession with ambition(never music - never got that feeling, always about being up there) and a desire for proving people who have humiliated you as wrong as the road to it! What is wrong with people? In my opinion succeeding at something requires true passion and love for it. Yes pushing ourselves is required along the way, but if the entire journey consists of it, the feelings with which we will reach the other end would be a far cry from sunshine and rainbows.In brief the entire movie consists of a sadistic instructor fishing for a student who does not break when methods resembling whack-a-mole are employed and succeeding(YAY!).
This film reminded me of my high school band instructor who brutalized a number of students. Some had to be hospitalized and developed symptoms that debilitated them for life. One of the trombone players lost his front teeth when the instructor threw a metal chair at him, complaining that he wasn't in tune. Later, he told us he was only kidding, and that if the trombonist didn't know he wasn't in tune then he deserved it. Nobody ever thought they were out of tune again because they didn't want their teeth knocked out. One day he threw a cymbal at one of the alto sax players and cut into his thigh, severing an artery. He was later hospitalized and still has a limp. The instructor said he did it because he heard Charlie Parker was named "Bird" because he had a cymbal thrown at him, which makes no sense to me but what do you expect from a psychotic band instructor? He swore like a sailor too. I later found out he was in rehab for methamphetamine abuse. I'm so glad I gave up the trumpet. The heck with a music career, those people are crazy.
