 loved SSN1, enjoyed SSN2 and can't get thru SSN3

 Season 3. Painful to watch

 Sucks the life out of the audience

 A review of season 3

 Nothing really happens

 Where did the 9.0 Rating come from?

 Boring

 overrated big time

 Oops, season 2 has got a problem

 Big disappointment

 Great acting but very slow series 3

 Good storytelling but always a terrible ending

 slow burner

 meh...irresponsible and indulgent storytelling

 Boring

 Am I the Only One ...?

 Watch Season 1, definitely avoid 2 & 3.

 For the make up ...lost points for Stephen Dorffs hairpiece!

 Eh? What? PARDON!??

 Meh
