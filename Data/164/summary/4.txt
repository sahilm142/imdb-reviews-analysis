 Cool concept, bad execution

 Good action, but no emotion or character development.

 There's a reason this film originally got poor reviews ...

 "What you fear most.. is among you"

 Disgusting

 One of the most overrated movies ever

 12 Deadbeats And A Whole Lotta Slime!

 Nice idea, poorly realized, way overrated

 Overly dark remake of classic 1951 sci-fi thriller

 Nonsensical monster, but movie is okay

 Dull storytelling mixed with imaginative schlock
