 Kubrick's Only Vice

 An empty and unpleasant film.

 So disgusting I am amazed it ever made to the top 250!

 The high ratings for this movie is saddening. Hours of my life I cannot retrieve.

 Didn't make me feel anything...

 Most OVERRATED Movie of ALL-TIME

 Insightful...

 Gratuitous violence

 A film for half-baked sociologists.

 Boring 1970's attempt to shock

 A Pseudo Masterpiece

 What????

 Painful mess

 sympathy for a rapist? I don't think so

 Was Kubrick On Crack?

 The parody in MAD Magazine titled 'A Clockwork Lemon' is the perfect review for this film

 Worst movie ever

 Disgusting crap

 A disappointment in the world of cinema.

 I am reminded of the Emperor's Clothes...

 Yuck

 I Hate This Movie

 s%#t-sandwich

 Just Awful

 Kubricks worst film
