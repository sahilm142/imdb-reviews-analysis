 Probably the most overrated movie of all times

 The Funniest Comedy of 1980

 Incoherent, lifeless, hack film-making. Horrible storytelling.

 A METHOD OF TORTURING YOUR ENEMIES. JUST SIT THEM DOWN AND MAKE THEM WATCH THIS.

 A real chore to sit through!

 Number one on my most awful list!

 One of the worst movies of all time!

 Absolutely awful, awful stuff

 One of the greatest directors, one of the greatest actors, one of the worst movies

 What was Stanley Kubrick doing directing horror?

 Absolutely Worthless

 What is Idiocy?

 Read the book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! May contain spoilers

 I waited for this?

 Heeeeere's Rubbish!

 Great Book awful casting

 Awful adaptation of a terrific--and terrifying, let alone actually scary--book.

 Muppets are scarier

 Overblown, directionless mess.

 disappointment

 It's not a horror movie, it's a movie about a crazy guy

 This is Horror?

 How can people love this bastardization of such a wonderful book?????

 this movie SUCKED

 Could have been great
