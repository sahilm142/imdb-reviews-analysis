 The summit of Everest

 One of the best sequels ever made

 A few historic flaws, but one of the best glimpses into turn-of-century NYC

 It doesn't hold a candle to the original but yet is one of the finest sequels of all time.

 Getting a bit overly dramatic, but still really good

 Indeed a classic ever green movie

 Where's Oscar for Pacino?!

 He might have had a chance.

 nice

 A Good Sequel, but<U+0085>

 Very good film, though not nearly as captivating as the original.

 A solid sequel, but a little long.

 Family Is Destiny

 Not as good as the original, but still a great crime film

 A very good sequel, but I still prefer the first film

 Towering Achievement by Pacino

 Michael Corleone losing his humanity (as if he had one)

 godfather part II is still the second

 Apocrypha

 A Great Movie in its Own Right

 Worthy sequel

 Sequel to a classic

 Much better than the first

 Pacino and De Niro star in the same film for the first time.

 watch this beacon of an epos in the landscape of normal "mafia-films"!
