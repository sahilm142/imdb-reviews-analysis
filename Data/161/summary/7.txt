 In your face cinema

 Like the main character, I just don't care.

 Shocking yet profound

 Perhaps a bit beyond me

 A hilarious and harsh look at drug addiction

 "I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on."

 Some just like watching, and some ride it

 sex, drugs and rock and roll

 Film Liquet on Trainspotting

 Dark, disturbing, funny and life-affirming, this slightly sardonic shot-to-the-vein makes no judgement (on its characters or its audience) and pulls no punches.

 Entertaining characters in a story of the dangers of loyalty.

 Choose life.

 Heroine addict tries to clean up his life

 a movie that reflects the inner-world and the subculture of heroin abuse

 Powerful anti-drug movie

 INCREDIBLE film!

 The Film That Brought Us Danny Boyle

 Hyped!

 Confusing film - but still pretty damn good.

 oi, overrated hipster shite

 Overrated Trip

 Writing as a non-European reviewer

 The struggle for human dignity and change

 accents and accidents

 Heroin, heroin and more herion; and the dire consequences of that much heroin...
