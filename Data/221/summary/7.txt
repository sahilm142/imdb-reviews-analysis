 Gorgeous film

 Gorgeous, brilliant, ironic, lifeless.

 A malignant fate

 Hate it or love it

 Kubrick's foray into history is worth a watch even to this day.

 Restrained historical drama with incredible period detail.

 All Show And No Heart

 Kubrick's foray into history is worth a watch even to this day

 A Scoundrel's Tale

 "I never saw a lad more game in me life."

 A successful amusement.

 Old School Delight From Kubs

 nice but superficial

 When you think of 'Kubrick', you should think of 'Lyndon'.

 Kubrick's mild letdown sandwiched in between two greats

 First part is great, second is just waiting for the end.

 A tale of virtue.

 Okay, certainly NOT one of the best films by Kubrick

 Opulent and engrossing...however, a deep-thinking sensibility muffles its overall impact

 The story of Barry Lyndon...

 Only half so engaging

 Irish social climber

 Obliquely Napoleonic

 Neither Masterpiece Nor Disaster

 Not Kubrick's Best, Though A Great Film Just the Same
