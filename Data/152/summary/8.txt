 Riveting and Exciting.

 Most Captivating Comic Book Adapatation I've Seen

 Great film

 Amazing Characters, Brilliant Action and a Tremendous Story

 V for Vox Populi, Verity, Victory, Veni, Vidi, Vici...

 "People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."

 Silly, but irrepressibly stirring

 One of the most underrated comic book movies of all-time!

 There were many traps, this movie avoided them all

 V has a Message

 Virtuosically superlative

 A comic book that acts like a novel.

 Quality!

 V for Vendetta: Remembering the 5th of November

 Initially a jab at Margret Thatcher, Applies to the US all too well...

 I was impressed..

 A Call To Action: See it now and stop our world from becoming like that.

 Very good movie

 Awesome film... BUT

 A slap in our face

 Courageous, fascinating movie signals a cultural shift

 v. good movie

 This world that I am a part of that I helped shaped will come to an end tonight with me

 Claim your Vendetta
