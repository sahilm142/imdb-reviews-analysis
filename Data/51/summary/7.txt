 Not plausible, but fun.

 Snazzy editing doesn't make an amazing film

 Good Crime Thriller!

 People Create Memories To Make Their Life Meaningful

 A Puzzle

 Confused but interested until the very end

 Intriguing idea--but #26 on IMDb??!?!?!?!

 A good film, yes, but certainly not an 8.7/10

 Overrated, but still good

 Fun plot gizmo, but nothing earth shaking

 Memento review

 Better Watch from the End

 Decent movie that fools the audience to believe it's deeper then it actually is!

 Great start by Christopher Nolan

 Good but a bit repetitive

 Unique but slightly overrated...

 Problematic.

 Good

 Am i crazy or this movie it's the most overrated of all times?

 Great the first time, but...

 A great thought evoking thriller

 A Film for Filmmakers

 Innovative and Clever, But Also Confusing to Viewers

 Watch it twice

 Nice
