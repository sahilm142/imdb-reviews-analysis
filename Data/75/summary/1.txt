 Once again, bow down, scrape your heels, knuckle your forehead... for no good reason at all!

 A masterpiece of torpor

 Oh Dear - What a MESS!

 Slow, boring, ridiculous, and predictable

 Awful garbage

 Did Hitchcock allow his assistant to direct?

 Hitchcocks most boring among his "classics"

 You like Vertigo because Hitch directed it!

 This movie SUCKED

 Boring

 The director of this is Ed Wood!

 Vertigo takes the crown

 Overrated Ridiculous Sexist Rubbish
