 Depressing, but a must see

 An extremely sensitive and poignant animated film.

 Beautiful haunting film

 It's one of the most depressing movies ever!

 Incredibly powerful film

 I can hardly see through the tears. Great drama anime.

 Tragedy

 I have a somewhat different take on this film

 i am speechless...this is so far my favourite manga film at the moment.....

 Essential viewing for war-mongers

 Possibly the most beautiful and touching movie I've seen in my whole life

 This is the most touching animated feature I've ever seen

 Quite good

 Saddest movie

 A Sober Film

 I'm trying to think of the saddest movie I've ever seen, nothing comes close to this

 Grave of the Fireflies offers a heartbreaking look at life and death that few films can rival.

 Good movie, be wary of the negatives due to lack of understanding

 A survival tale

 A gritty, dark, studio ghibli movie.

 Storytelling done right

 Another amazing Japanese animation

 So basically this is a movie about a brother and sister who are struggling to survive during the war.

 Masterpiece

 This isn't a story of heroism, meaning, or anything remotely related. Its about survival.
