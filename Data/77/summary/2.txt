 I still don't get it

 should have been a theatre play

 pushy, manipulative, annoying, offensive

 Major disappointment, completely overrated and a film with a trailer better than the actual film. 2/10

 I just don't see what the big deal is!

 It's no Pulp Fiction...

 Why does everyone like this movie?

 Disappointed

 Insipid dialogue frightened me off

 Dogs overrated

 Depiction of Depravity

 What?

 Snuff Film

 So overrated

 One of the most boring movies I have watched
