 Best live action Punisher interpretation i've seen, but beware of Netflix virtue signaling

 Enjoyed Season 1....

 I forgot I was watching the Punisher!

 A pretty good military drama that has little or nothing to do with the Punisher

 Fine if you want to see flat acting and a portrayal of how corrupt our military is

 Secondary characters ruin the show

 The Punisher with a moral dilemma??

 Revenge in the slow lane

 Sort of Punisher-ish, yes, but not quite the real deal

 THEY FORGOT THE ACTION SCENES

 Should add DRAMA to the genre description

 Another glimpse into the minds of the entertainment elites

 Watching was a punishment

 Slow amd sluggish!

 Such a disappointment

 Season 2 disappointed

 Don't understand why people gave this good reviews

 It just didn't keep my interest. (No actual spoilers here.)

 Jon Bernthal's Rendition of The Punisher Not My Cup of Tea

 bad ending

 How the hell are they all alive after season 2?

 Lame progressive liberal virtue signaling.

 Big opportunity wasted.

 8.6 yeah what a joke
