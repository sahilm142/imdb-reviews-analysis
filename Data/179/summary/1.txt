 Astonishingly bad plot

 If Fincher was looking to UNDO himself...he has succeeded.

 An enormous junk heap of illogic and nonsense

 A total mess.

 Utter Tripe

 I can not believe people like this ~~~~~contains spoilers~~~~~~

 Sad Commentary on Film Today

 Horrible the movie was just so unrealistic that it sucked

 Wish I had missed it

 Wow, and not in a good way...

 Everyone has a very different opinion

 Truly terrible movie.

 A Cavalcade of "Deepities"

 Gone Girl Boring and Quite dull with a few moments of interest.

 I'm a fan a of true crime books. OK, then, look at the score I gave.

 Horrible thats's it

 TERRIBLE - with capital letters

 Utteryl Boring unless a Diatribe Against Female Empowerment

 Someone is losing it

 This movie was absolutely terrible

 Agatha Christie for the Internet Generation

 After watching Gone Girl, I want to cry, vomit and cry again

 Waste of time

 Disappointing waste of time

 Insulting. No worry about spoiler, the whole film is spoiled.
