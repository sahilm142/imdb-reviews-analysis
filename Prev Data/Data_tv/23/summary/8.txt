 5 Reasons why Season 2 Sucks

 engrossing

 Wonderfully intelligent right up until...

 Two Detectives Out For A Walk

 Eps 2-5, sublime genius, maybe peaked too early

 Something New

 Different seasons

 Life Changing

 Riveting

 2014 Has A Monster TV Show to Boast Off.

 A great First season that is tense and gripping

 Excellent 3rd Series, Rotten Dialogue Audio

 Good, but not great...

 Season three, not as good as expected

 Slow boiler

 Great first season, terrible second season, a bit disappointing third

 Season 1 best

 Watch them all

 A well made show with a strong but complicated plot

 Can't wait second season

 One for the ages..
