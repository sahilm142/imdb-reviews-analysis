 Emotionally draining but truly moving "ripped from the headlines" story

 Fantastic and compelling

 A film for those who stupidly believe there's no smoke without fire.

 This is a Film with a capital "F"

 The narrative's genius embeds observer-effect with great accuracy — unforgettable masterpiece.

 Harrowing Film!
