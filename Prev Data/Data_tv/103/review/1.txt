I love period drama on the BBC and PBS. This avalanche of glowing reviews is an orchestrated fraud. I'll make myself quick - I've been watching Masterpiece Theatre and BBC serial dramas for 40 years, and, let me tell you, THIS IS WORST PRODUCTION ON THE BBC THAT HAVE EVER SEEN! None of rings true. The entire story has the trite, simple-minded, devoid from reality of a Barbara Cartland novel The entire enterprise - neither the acting, the script, plot development ring true. I have spent the entire series SMH, hooting laughter, or berating the screen because IT IS SO BAD.I'm just finishing the series right now, because it is so BAD, it is akin to being transfixed by horrible automobile crash
