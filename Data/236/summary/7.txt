 I can see why it's a classic

 So the old girl is finally 30!

 When the B movie became the A movie

 Not for swimmers

 Good film! Good suspense music! But it could have been better.

 Wow... just wow

 It wasn't a propeller.. It wasn't a coral reef.. And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.. It was a Shark!

 Classic thriller

 You might want to remain on shore for a while after this movie...

 Good film!

 Good

 "were going to need a bigger boat"

 "Just When You Thought It Was Safe To Go Back In The Water!"

 In the top 3 truly scary films of all time

 I wish I'd seen it when it came out.

 Pretty good, but not his best

 Another of Spielberg's classics

 a classic made by an icon

 Ladies and gentlemen, INTRODUCING... Mayor Larry Vaughn the B!@#$%d!

 Suspenseful and Iconic

 Pricey<U+0085>Populist...B-Movie Entertainment at its Best
