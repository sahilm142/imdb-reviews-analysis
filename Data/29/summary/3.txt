 Typical saccharine pap from Spielberg

 Typical American propoganda

 Righteous, Embellishing, and slightly Jingoistic

 Movie could have ended after twenty minutes!

 America is the best is the best is the best

 Confuses Verisimilitude, Authenticity, Documentation, and Realism

 Hyped as the most realistic war movie ever - gimme a break

 A pile of corn

 Perposterous

 More war moralina from the US

 Lifeless characters die in battle

 Where did they get this script?

 Too many clichés

 Great battle scenes but not that good ...

 Goofy, again.

 realistic landing on the beach

 Generic war epic with an incredible opening act

 What a cop out.

 Wildly overrated

 Bull and More Bull

 Clichéd, tedious and incredibly unpleasant to watch

 Slow and Boring

 "Average to Poor"

 There's no "saving" this movie...

 Just another piece of American candy from Uncle Steven. Does anybody here cares about Ryan anyway?
