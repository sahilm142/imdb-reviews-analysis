 The War for your Soul

 This was a valued rug

 Redux version is HORRIBLE. stick with the original

 A little overrated, but pretty good----7/10

 Crumbles under its own weight

 Heart of Darkness

 Stay On The Boat

 Brando ruins a superb movie

 A beast of a film built upon spectacular spectacle and practically seeping with blood, sweat and tears.

 For the most part, a great war movie

 Insanely Heavy Reenactment of Dystopian War; Sheen Shining

 Exaggerated fictional account of an American military leader gone insane.

 27 years later and has points of interest

 "Charlie Don't Surf"

 Not so great. Very Gory.

 A good film that could have been better.

 Apocalypse Then was better

 The Insanity of the Vietnam War

 Copolla's Apocalypse

 Good but could have done better...

 Absorbing, thought-provoking, and a little too surreal

 Beautiful cinematography
