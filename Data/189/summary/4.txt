 Same old Same old

 Weak and rather pointless movie with a luxury wrapping

 Was so looking forward to this. But sadly....

 A movie for its own cult following

 It falls really short

 Boring for most people

 Had the Feel of 1960s Blake Edwards Film

 Did nothing for me.

 The emperor is naked!

 The problem with Wes Anderson. Flat, X & Y and full of 90 degree right angles

 In the Anderson oeuvre, there's a lot to see, but he has hardly anything to say

 Most Overrated Movie of the Year

 It's okay, I guess

 Boring from the very beginning to the very end

 I've just got to stop watching Wes Anderson movies

 Now on DVD

 Did not like it

 This is not a comedy
