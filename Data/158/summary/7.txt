 The General (1926)

 The General

 My Second Favorite Buster Keaton Film

 On point with the detail...

 Predictable Gold

 Good, although I don't like it as much as I'm supposed to

 Action packed

 A fabulous film

 Good Show

 Great black and white classic based on a true story.

 The great Buster Keaton

 Significant elements in The General

 Generally well executed but somewhat lacking in fun

 kind of funny but tedious

 All about love...

 Great silent film

 Different Style of Comedy for the Silent Era

 An entertaining silent film.

 Gone with the Wind

 money well spent
