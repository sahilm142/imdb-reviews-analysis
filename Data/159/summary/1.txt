 Wish I loved it (Spoilers)

 Despicable Snuff Film with Pseudo-Intellectual Pretensions

 Possibly the most overrated movie ever made . . .

 A frustrating film that goes nowhere

 Genius? Hell no, simply misguided directors...

 Nothing Could Possibly Be Worse Then This Awful Movie

 Not as good as some folks would like to think

 Better titles could have been: "No story"; "No Point"; "No Ending".

 Too many plot holes to be good.

 Gallons and gallons of blood

 This film is ludicrous

 AWFUL =The WORST Movie Going Experience Of My Life

 Great, if you like 1/2 of a movie, with no ending...

 What a piece of garbage.

 Wasn't that good

 Friday the 13th Meet the Same Old Coens

 Bad movie.

 Critics and Previews Failed Miserably

 I absolutely hated No Country For Old Men, and I am serious about it.

 Terrible Movie

 I screamed with pain

 No Awards for this Worthless Film

 Best Picture of the YEAR?!

 Best Picture of the Year!??

 a profoundly disturbing and immoral movie
