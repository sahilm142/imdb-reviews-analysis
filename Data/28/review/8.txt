I couldn't help but set rather high expectations for 'The Usual Suspects' as I went into watching this. I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.Around 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-


                
language a bit confusing during boat attack, where were cops? hard to like anyone in film"The Usual Suspects" is a well-made film from start to finish and I do recommend you see it...maybe. Let me explain. While the film is excellent it also is unpleasant, violent, filled with expletives (particularly the old f-bomb) and has nothing but unlikable characters. For me, films like this, "Good Fellas" and "The Fight Club" are just pretty nasty films--but still, they are quality films--unpleasant quality films. The film is a very confusing story about a gang of five guys who meet in the oddest way--at a police lineup! The five decide to get together for an illegal job and soon end up being extorted to do a job for 'Keyser Soze'-- man who no one seems to know but who inspires fear in those who hear his name (sort of like Valdemort). I'd say more, but frankly I don't want to ruin the film. Suffice to say, it's a film with a BIG twist--like "The Fight Club" or "The Crying Game" and so I'll stop with that.The bottom line is if you like violent films with very graphic violence and language, then "The Usual Suspects" is for you. The acting, writing and directing are great. If you would rather see films a bit more uplifting or family-friendly, do NOT see this film! Seriously.


                
The Usual Suspect is one of those films which tell you that seeing is believing. Don't get me wrong it was a very good film and I am glad I finally got the chance to see it but with critics going on and on about it, they kind of kill the magic of the movie. However that really did not hinder my enjoyment as I decided to treat this just like any other movie. Basic concept of 5 cons on various heist missions until one goes terribly wrong and then the authorities try to establish what went wrong hearing this from the account of one of the crippled crooks (Kevin Spacey). Gabreil Bryne was a excellent in his role as the lead crook and Benico Del Toro was also a stand out performance but we all know that Kevin Spacey was the man who took joy in playing the audience like a piano. A film can start of slow but the ending is the most important thing in the whole thing and I am glad to say that this ending was nothing short of a slap in the face.THE USUAL SUSPECTS - 8.1 OUT 10 THE GREATEST TRICK THAT THE DEVIL EVER PULLED WAS CONVINCING THE WORLD THAT HE DOESN'T EXHIST AND JUST LIKE THAT..... HE'S GONE !


                
A movie whose name is gotten from a line in the old classic, Casablanca "The Usual Suspect" is about an interrogation gone wrong. The movie is very hard to connect together, and the masterful twist ending for some did more harm than good, but for me it was the thriller of the whole movie. The fact that after the movie is over I still have to sit down and think about it, connecting the dots and wanting to have another re- run of the movie to be sure that I don't miss any dot, that is the reason why this movie is a master piece.Written by Christopher McQuarrie, the Keyser Söze character is based on the accounts of John List, an accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost 20 years by assuming a new identity before he was eventually apprehended in 1989. McQuarrie got the name Keyser Söze from the name of his former supervisor Keyser Sume, and the last name Söze is Turkish which is translated as "talk too much."The Interrogation scene was first shot and it ran for 6 days, and the rest of the movie was put together next and editing was the grand touch that made this mystery thriller that good a movie to see.The movie plot is about the interrogation of a small time con man named Roger "Verbal" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who is a one of the only two survivors of a heist gone wrong that resulted to a fire on a ship. He tells the interrogator the series of events that led him and four other criminals to the boat.This series of events are shown to the viewer in the form of flashbacks as Kint narrates his story to the over confident interrogator. As the story goes on and gets complex the interrogator connects the dots and explains the story better to Kint, only to get the shocker of his life when he releases Kint believing he was used by the other four.Done with a 6 million dollar production budget, the movie recouped its production cost and more; the well crafted screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie gained him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Kevin Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the criminal Keyser Söze.The Usual suspect is a fine film, well developed to push the imaginations of the viewer, the unexpected ending is the cream on the top of this delicious masterpiece and one thing is sure, you will be asking for seconds after you are done seeing it the first time. www.lagsreviews.com


                
In the beginning of "The Usual Suspects," a man is killed on the deck of a ship, and suddenly an explosion completely tears apart the docked ship. Flash forward to the next day. Dave Kujan (Chazz Palimenteri) is forcing a statement out of the only surviver of the explosion, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, in the role that made him a star). Verbal recalls the last few weeks to Dave, who listens intently.We start when five criminals are brought in for a line-up. There's McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint. While they are being held in prison, the five men all agree that the police just need someone to pin the crime they are suspected of on someone. They all agree to plan revenge by forming a league of crime...Lotta stuff happens, next we know a legendary criminal named Keizer Soze (whose name reminds me of a type of food) has the five men under his control. He makes them steal drugs off a docked ship, and as we see in the beginning, the men all die save Verbal. Hmm, who could Keizer Soze be? How did all the people die? Who is Lara Croft? Oops, wrong tagline."The Usual Suspects" is a very good film, but not one of my favorites. It's extremely catchy, brutal, etc., but comes across slightly shallow. The ending, though surprising, doesn't really click together as well as some other films with surprises. I wasn't confused by the ending, I understood it, I just thought it was a bit shallow compared to some other flicks.MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!In the end we find out Kevin Spacey is Keizer Soze...I think...or is he Soze's henchman? Or is Soze just a legend? It's open to debate. But what makes it a bit more shallow from other films is that Verbal Kint is the one who tells this long story to Dave Kujan, and assumably he made most of it up because he was the criminal all along and had to cover himself up...so there's no real "wow!" element. If Verbal made up the story and turns out to be the man behind the killings, well, it's just a bit shallow as compared to some other films. We are expected to be amazed that he is Soze, but if the tale he told Kujan and us was for the most part a lie, then the fact that he was Soze all along isn't quite as amazing...umm...do you understand what I'm saying?But I'm not saying I dislike this movie. In fact, that's far from it. I really enjoyed this flick. It's terrific. Great performances by the entire cast, especially Spacey, who won an Oscar for his role. Even Stephen Baldwin was good in this movie!"The Usual Suspects" is a lot like "Basic," a film starring John Travolta. There are a lot of plot twists, but the duration of the film is a bunch of lies, and many of the "twists" don't make sense, and are there simply to confuse the audience into thinking something else. Behind all the gloss there isn't a whole lot there. But "The Usual Suspects" is still a great film, and though the end is slightly shallow, and the duration of the film is an excuse for the ending, it's still surprising and effective. And unlike "Basic" which dragged on for over two hours, "The Usual Suspects" knows when to stop its banter and get to the point.Effective film-making, but slightly overrated and shallow.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer
To be honest I thought this film was good up until the last ten minutes, thats when it became a great film. The preleptic techniques used was amazing so that by the end you are just as fooled as the characters in the story.Spacey's performance was excellent you really don't see the ending coming as a viewer it really comes right out of the blue, this film by the end is something so complex and really makes you think, without completely exhausting your mind it creates a paradox that I don't think anyone could figure out by the end. Yes, you are left with a few questions at the end, but thats the beauty of this film, as the case just ends in the film, the police are left and so are you as a viewer, however they don't leave annoying small links it instead ties up the main storyline well. It is truly an ending that is mind numbing and something that other films should definitely try to replicate.The story is so intricately written and portrayed that it is amazing to watch, and I noticed that the complexity of shots improves as the film progresses and the team venture into larger operations, yet even still Im left with the feeling that I could watch it again, and not see the ending coming again.Only negatives were for me the police investigation which proved to be completely irrelevant to the storyline, and so can be seen as a hindrance, but the rest of the film makes up for this.Intricate Storyline, complex but is made amazing by its ending.
The Usual Suspects follows the interrogation of Roger "Verbal" Kint. Verbal is one of two survivors of a drug deal gone wrong at the Port of Los Angeles. He tells the interrogator, Kujan, a drawn-out story about events that led him and the four other "usual suspects" to the port the night the drug deal went wrong, leading to a fire and several casualties. At the beginning the five suspects are brought into questioning over a truck hijacking. The suspects are Michael McManus played by Stephen Baldwin, Dean Keaton played by Gabriel Byrne, Fred Fenster played by Benicio Del Toro, Todd Hockney played by Kevin Pollak, and Roger "Verbal" Kint played by Kevin Spacey.The theme of The Usual Suspects is that pride and arrogance lead to manipulation and betrayal. At the beginning of the film, none of the suspects will admit to anything that happened with the hijacking. We immediately see that these five men are arrogant but at the same time loyal, not throwing any of the other men under the bus so to speak. During the movie Kint manipulates the other "usual suspects" by playing puppet master without them even knowing it.This theme keeps true throughout the film as Verbal is being interrogated by Kujan. As the story becomes more complex we see Verbal becoming more arrogant and manipulative of Kujan. The character of Verbal becomes more and more interesting as the movie goes on. Kevin Spacey was the perfect actor to play the role of Verbal as Spacey does well in providing mystery.In respect to theme, this movie is similar to The Interview. The 1998 movie The Interview is also revolved around a man's drawn-out interrogation for crimes he may or may not have committed.One technique used in The Usual Suspects is the motif of an unreliable narrator. Verbal often skirts around the questions being asked during his interrogation. Another technique used is flashbacks. As Verbal is being interrogated throughout this film Verbal narrates through the flashbacks exactly what happened the night of the boat explosion. The fact that Verbal was an unreliable narrator, thus the flashback scenes being unreliable as well, ties back to the theme of pride and arrogance leading to betrayal and manipulation.The pride and arrogance all of the "usual suspects" portrayed throughout this film shows how easy it is to manipulate and betray people. This film was one a lot of people can relate to in general because we have all been manipulated/ have manipulated others at some point in our lives.
When i heard about the movie people were saying stuff like ;"its the best movie I've ever seen" or "best movie of all time", so of course i had to see it. But i was really disappointed. I just didn't get what was so awesome about it. I asked around a little, and apparently it was the twist in the end that made it "the best movie ever". That just doesn't make sense.Sure you go "oh, he was the guy?" in the end, but thats it. Other than that it wasn't "the best" in any way. The acting was average, the script and screenplay wasn't remarkable. All that fuzz was about the last couple of minutes of the movie.It was kind of entertaining, but still not close to the masterpiece people describe it as
***spoilers ****You call that a surprise ending?It was pretty clear almost from the outset.  Let's see, of the original 5, only one survives, do you think he might of done it? It doesn't take a rocket scientist.If that weren't enough, there were so many cues throughout the movie (he gets really mad when he finds out about the survivor screaming his name). There were many others but I won't list them all here.That said, I think the movie was well-done, and the final scenes well-told with plenty of humor. But I'm truly shocked by how many people didn't see that coming right from the start (and no, I had no idea this movie was supposed to have any kind of surprise ending).
*** end spoilers ****
There is no doubt that this is an entertaining movie with a very good and well-disguised plot twist at the end.  Apparently, voting IMDB users are so enthralled by the last 2 minutes of this film and the presentation of the plot twist, that this movie ranks 17th all-time and ahead of many classic films from the last 75 years.  The IMDB Top 250 is an interesting list to study.  Lots of great movies are in that list, and more than a few overrated and perplexing selections too.  And 'The Usual Suspects' certainly jumps out as one movie that gets more credit than it deserves, though it is a good movie.


                
Thanks mainly to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), the 1990's saw the re-emergence of crime noir - talky, violent thrillers packed with colourful characters and even more colourful language. Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects was one of the best of the bunch, thanks mainly to the director taking influence from past masters such as Hitchcock, Lang and Kurosawa, rather than the many Tarantino copycats that flooded the 90's cinema market, who did little but poorly imitate the big-chinned one's chatty screenplays and outlandish, darkly humorous violence. It also had a killer twist; one that will baffle as much as it will surprise, or possibly induce cries of cheap manipulation.After what appears to be a heist gone wrong on an exploded boat, the only surviving witness, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a disabled con-man, is brought in to be interrogated by customer officer Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Having already been acquitted by some mysterious higher powers, Kint is probed by Kujan for more information. He tells a story of five criminals who meets in a line-up - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a steely criminal gone straight, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), an entry man with a short fuse, Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker, Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus's partner, and Kint himself. Having being picked up one time too many, the group hatch a plot to pay the crooked cops back, and eventually start taking jobs from the shady Redfoot (Peter Greene).While the build-up to the explosion seen at the beginning of the film is relatively formulaic in its execution, Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for his efforts) inject enough humour into the script to bring these characters alive, and bring them over to your side. The clever thing is that it soon becomes apparent that everything were seeing either isn't true or isn't at all relevant, and it's the increasingly looming presence of the mysterious and infamous criminal mastermind Keyser Soze, who may in fact hold all the cards. The twist is not particularly clever at all, and isn't that hard to guess, but the director's skill in capturing it is what makes it so memorable.The now-iconic poster wouldn't be so iconic if the characters hadn't been so memorably played by it's cast. With the exception of Kint, the characters are little but stock characters, but there is genuine chemistry, especially in the line-up scene where they crack up after Baldwin's over-the-top delivery of a line. Byrne proves again that he is much more deserving than the mediocre roles he tends to land, and Spacey bagged a Supporting Actor Oscar for his puppy-dog con-man. It's far, far from deserving of its place as #23 on IMDb's top films of all time, but The Usual Suspects is riveting stuff, even after it's umpteenth viewing.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com


                
Plot and acting I thought were great, but I feel the accent by the first suspect that died was a bit exaggerated and difficult to understand.While I did know about the existence of a twist, I was caught off guard by the double twist, so I was a bit happy about the surprise.Despite this, I feel the premise of the movie was a bit off and merely used as a setup to the climax of the film. What kind of person would work so hard to make a convoluted plan to use convicts to help him kill a boat full of people just so people wouldn't know who he was. And then in the end he is so careless as to let one live and also end up making it so his identity is revealed to even more people.Despite this, the devil line quote was memorable and also the dialogue in the rest of the movie. Overall a good movie.
The problems with movies like "The usual Suspects" is that they are taken too seriously. People flock to identify a hidden meaning, a socially relevant message or a reflection of time when it was made. While a good movie may and, sometimes, does have one or more of these attributes, still the basic point of every good movie is to entertain. If the movie has involved me in it, made me suspend my disbelief to move along enthusiastically with the story, it has done its job. The Usual Suspects does just that. You may sit comfortably long after the movie is over and think about how some parts make no sense or are improbable. But, while watching it just sweeps you, partly because of its same improbability and also because of its pace. The pace is just right, not fast enough to make you lose track of what is happening, or slow enough to second-guess the motives and figure out the plot twists. The way the movie unfolded and ended was enough to keep me interested throughout. The ending is a classic, even if you guess it a little before you are expected. Of course, the delight in watching it the second time is immense as armed with the revelation at the end, you can view a lot of scenes with an investigative interest and come off totally consumed. Besides its plot, TUS has brilliant performances to keep you entertained and some great dialogs. It is one of those movies form which you can take nothing home, apart from the pleasure while watching it. I say, thats enough!!


                
My Personal Rating - 8.1/ 10 - One of the best film about crime out there, kevin spacey's Superb Acting, a good written film with good cinematography acting. just like goodfellas atmosphere. if you love that film, then what are you waiting for? watch this film right now. what great decent film.


                
The Usual Suspects is a movie I've been meaning to watch since forever. My dad actually owns the DVD, but sometimes you have to rent a movie to actually see it - because you've paid for it and it would suck if you'd basically lose money and not see it.I didn't know much about The Usual Suspects. Story-wise I only knew that picture of the line up. I had avoided the spoilers almost perfectly. Just almost? I did know about the twist. I didn't know what it was, I just knew there was going to be a huge twist. Also I had seen that one Saturday Night Live sketch, which kind of gives something away. Even though I kind of knew something about the ending, I didn't know the story, and I didn't know how to get to the ending and what the ending would actually mean in the story, because a SNL sketch doesn't exactly explain the referenceIt's hard to get in the right mood with the movie. There's no hook before the opening credits, you just have to wait until they are over or maybe fast forward through them. They offer nothing except John Ottman's music, which is of course decent, but not any different from typical movie music. But when the movie begun, it just begun. It was a bit fast, unclear. What is happening, who are these people, oh now we're at now... When they start questioning Verbal it becomes clearer. Still flashbacks are a hard way to tell the story - they are very quick and the audience can feel like something was left out, except I think this is exactly what McQuarrie might've been after. But once you get used to the pace and the style of story telling, the movie turns into a very exciting thriller. I guess the only problem in watching this movie over 20 years later is that it's now easier to guess the big twist. It might be because of a certain actor, it might be because this kind of twist is now more common, or it's just the evolution of cinema. But at one point while watching this movie it all clicked together. Of course the SNL sketch helped, and so did that one scene from the first Scary Movie - which is something I haven't seen in ages but it just came to me and I realised that's where it's from!But figuring out a twist isn't exactly bad, you can also feel super victorious.All in all, The Usual Suspects is a good thriller, a bit slow but the end makes it so much better. It has definitely aged well. But after seeing it once I don't feel like watching it again any time soon. It might be like some other movies with major twist: once you know it, you can watch it maybe once more to like see it from the new perspective, but that's it.


                
After hearing people rave about this movie I finally managed to watch this movie a couple of months ago. I have to admit it the first time I disliked it, I probably wasn't concentrating. The second time I absolutely loved it. The usual suspect is fantastic twisty thriller backed up by wonderful performances from all the main leads.It seems hard to imagine thatthe writer of The Usual Suspects was only twenty four when he wrote it.Kevin Spacey in my opinion completely stole the show. Even though I knew whatthe final twist was it did hinder me from appreciating it. What is so amazing is how the writer managed to skillfully put in clues that could lead us to a conclusion but the references are so slight we might not notice it. It seems to have inspired other movies with twists at the end that leave your head spinning, for instance The Sixth Sense. The Usual Suspects in my opinion is the best thriller of the 90's.


                
"The Usual Suspects" is a thrilling crime drama, filled with suspense. Kevin Spacey plays Verbal Kint, the narrator of a twisted tale that begins with a police lineup in New York, and ends with a dockside massacre in California.  Behind it all is the mysterious and dangerous Keyser Soze. Bryan Singer's criminal saga is haunting and clever, and well cast.  Kevin Spacey turns in a great performance as Verbal, setting an oddball tone.  The rest of the crew is headed by Gabriel Byrne's Dean Keaton, with thugs Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro and Stephen Baldwin along for the ride.  This crew of five shows great clashing chemistry.  In the end, you'll be shocked. "The Usual Suspects" has become a new crime cult classic.


                
Brilliantly made, directed, and written movie about criminals who meet in a line-up and decide to go on a crime spree for money. Very well scripted, and direction is very well done. Director Bryan Singer (X-men 1&2, Apt Pupil) has earned respect as a filmmaker by leading you into so many places only to put it all together to make one.One of my new favorite movies of all time is done so well, once you get into it, everyone around you won't matter. You won't even notice they are there. It is a must see, though slow at the beginning (for me, anyway; I was a little lost) and then like a roller-coaster of clues the next. I great mystery/thriller done to the fullest extent imaginable.Though, the R rating left out a few things: a scene of rape (very mild...ish) and for mild gore and drugs. Thge rest of the rating says language and violence. Lots of language said in colorful ways, and violence off and on. A must see overall.


                
The title might suggest a comedic takeoff on a crime thriller employing some sophisticated shtick or maybe we're in for something like Danny DeVito in "Throw Mama from the Train." But this is not a comedy. It is not exactly your usual crime thriller either. It is an unconscious parody of crime thrillers with some curious depth replete with corrupt cops, shadowy off screen sinister villains and pathetic low lifes.Although I don't think director Bryan Singer and his high school pal and collaborator, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie, had the slightest intention toward burlesque, I was again and again struck by an unconscious underlying tone of parody. The title is the tip off."Round up the usual suspects" is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know. Claude Rains, as Captain Renault, head of the police in Casablanca, says "round up the usual suspects" more as an indication of local Moroccan justice than as a real order. It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.While Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, "The Usual Suspects" is anything but. The cast is decidedly and deliberately all male with only Suzy Amis in a minor role as Edie Finneran to interfere with the macho lineup of crooks, cops and shady sinister types. The movie features Stephen Baldwin (Mike McManus), Gabriel Bryne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and stars Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint. These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film. In more ways than one I am reminded of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (movie directed by James Foley). Consider these similarities: In both Glengarry and The Usual Suspects you have a virtually all male cast who sling expletives at one another in an "at your throat" style. In both Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects you have five crooks thrown together to do a job, and again everything is exceedingly macho with threats and expletives flying around like water in a hurricane. In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs. These guys are not your run of the mill actors. They are the kind of guys that star in kick butt movies. They know how to look and act authentic.But an even more startling way to compare The Usual Suspects with Glengarry and Reservoir Dogs is in the dialogue. In all three movies the dialogue is preciously wrought with an emphasis on sounding just a little different. In Reservoir Dogs Tarantino sometimes makes the characters sound like they are spouting Shakespeare, and in Glengarry Glen Ross Mamet has them playing verbal hijinks like machine gun chatter in an experimental stage play. Here Singer and McQuarrie (his script won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) employ a lot of the same rapid fire, seemingly authentic vernacular interspersed with theatrical sounding speech especially in the case of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who calmly calls everybody "Mister" like an English butler. And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist." Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak. And pay attention to references to Skokie, Illinois. That will help to unravel the plot. The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.Currently rated #17 at IMDb, The Usual Suspects is the sort of cult favorite beloved by young males fascinated with testosterone-hyped action, macho-inspired dialogue and devil man care anti-heroics. But it's a little better than that. And clearly this is not a chick flick, and therein lies a problem. While most males will at least find this interesting, many females will just shake their heads at how obvious is the seduction of the targeted audience. Personally I thought the movie was a laugh. I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it. But I have to say (for those directors, writers and producers who would like to do half as well), you can't fake it. Tarantino and Singer and others have been able to pull this sort of thing off because they really believe in the psychology. They really believe there are tough guys who say "f-you" even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world. And there's some truth to it.Spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem. He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified. He is the seeming loser, the little guy, the underdog who turns out to be smarter and tougher than anybody else. I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.Bottom line: a must see for anybody interested in the history of the American cinema and in the evolution of the mystery/thriller/noir genre. A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint. You might want to write one yourself.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!)


                
A fun movie - in a very dark and twisted sort of way. This is more than just an action thriller; this is a brilliant movie that has all sorts of interesting dialogue. The dark humor aspect comes in where one character enters the office of a detective who starts to question him about a certain crime legend. The way the character tells the story is gripping and funny because he starts to jumble all sorts of myths, legends and free association nuances into a powerful mystery. The way the characters handle the police investigation is also quite comical, but the humor is not blatant in any way whatsoever - it is subtle and is mixed with real-life struggles and questions. In many ways this movie is the magnum opus of the crime thriller genre.


                
Great Movie! A joy to watch, deserves a top 20 position. Very engaging, and gives you a unique perspective. Despite it being a 1995 movie, cinematography is done to perfection in my opinion. Would love to see more movies similar to this one and be able to relate to it. Overall, a fantastic Motion Picture, and would definitely recommend it to my peers and coworkers. Got goosebumps during some parts of the movie. Been an avid user of www.flickstree.com , it allows me to watch the movies via different platforms like Netflix, iTunes, Google Play, and many more. Some of the movies are free to watch too!

After watching "Reservoir Dogs" I could slightly tell the similarities between this film. Although their maybe a lot of people that may disagree, I thought it was slightly similar. This is a cool and clever, film that build suspense and interest as it goes. This is more of a mystery movie, but it's not a mystery movie where the audiences will try to piece together all the puzzle pieces. Instead it's a intricately woven mystery crime thriller that gets more interesting as it goes. Maybe because of the multilayered direction, the really well done editing and clever storytelling. So the story is told from Roger "Verbal" Kint about what went down on the before, during the ship heist. With him and his dysfunctional and yet effective crew getting set up for a task and how they went about it. And what the motives of each of the crew members were and so on. The lighting and camera work was also really good and it felt like you were following the heist crew and following through with the process to a slight degree. Bryan Singer started making this movie at the age of 27 and to craft a clever and smart movie at that age and got the resources and cast together is one heck of a accomplishment. This movie is rightfully a cult classic.8.8/10
This is one of these seminal films and whether it's truly the first to accomplish its main feature, it's at least the bigger film to do it this early. A film that's had Scary Movie utilize one of its premises. A movie that influential that it's completely infiltrated the collective unconscious. A movie you'd call: "classic". Overall, the qualities are as follows: the acting especially from Palmintieri and Spacey, but also Byrnes and the Lord Kobayashi guy. The concept and its execution globally close to flawless. The irony behind it all, and of course the twist at the end. The flaws: there's too much talking, and the film seems like it draws towards the ending more than stands on its own, it feels like the movie-makers gave the ending so much importance they unknowingly neglected the rest of it. It's not a particularly enticing film to watch in its entirety, and it only gets interesting starting at a certain later point.


                
Despite the heavy cursing in this film I was captivated from the moment it started.Although when I first saw that there is a "Hungarian mafia" in the film I was absolutely surprised. I've never heard in my entire life about a Hungarian mafia in America. I am Hungarian and what I know that in the entire history of my country we have been victims of horrible things, oppressors after oppressors, and I could go on. So my guess is that the screenwriter was bored with the usual story of Italian mafia and wanted to come up with some exotic language that these mafia people could use in his movie and which the viewer can't understand, which turned out to be Hungarian.And the twist at the end is pretty cool but I have to admit that I knew the identity of Kaiser Soze right after the riddle has been given to the viewer to solve. To see my educated guess be confirmed at the end was very gratifying :)
