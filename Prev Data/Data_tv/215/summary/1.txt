 I still can't believe these are the same writers of The Last Airbender

 As shortcoming of a sequel as it gets.

 A "darker and edgier" Last Airbender. Mostly darker.

 A train wreck that gave me aids and cancer watching it

 Insult To Storytelling In General

 Disappointed really

 Depressing. Don't watch if you loved Avatar: The Last Airbender

 Outrageous garbage

 Does Not Teach Us Anything but Good Drawing Techniques

 Power rangers

 Definitely not an 8.6/10.
