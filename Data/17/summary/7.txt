 not so good as it's imdb ranking

 Slick, flashy, often brilliant, yet cannot make you give a hoot about its characters

 "Good But Not Great" Fellas

 When talented filmmakers turned to badfellas and made a movie called "Goodfellas"

 May Fold Under Questioning

 Goodfellas

 Great cast in a mediocre movie

 Can there be integrity in the Mafia?

 interesting but deeply flawed

 True gangster saga packs a wallop...

 A good film

 A Thoroughly Investigated, Extensively Detailed & Wickedly Amusing Crime Opus

 An Inside Look

 Scorsese's snappy, hip Mafia flick with Ray Liotta, De Niro, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino

 "Murderers comes with smiles"

 Machavelli is loving this

 Reasonably fun, but overrated.

 overrated ganster movie

 Pretty good, but overrated

 A thrilling, action-packed gangster film

 The Greatest Mob Film Ever? Really?

 Good-not great, fellas.

 "Bustin' balls"

 Too HIGH on IMDb charts for my liking!

 Good movie but...
