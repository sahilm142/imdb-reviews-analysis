 Fantastic production, we are living in the golden age of series

 Netflix strikes gold again

 Went high up on the hill then fell off the cliff

 Muy Excellente!

 Justa great show

 Cats and drugs

 An amazing streaming original about important history

 It's Overrated

 Portrayal of Escobar left you feeling what a sick and evil man he must have been.

 Get a spine, writers

 Another great season.

 Great Show

 Brilliant

 Watch only the second season, that's all you need

 Hits all the right notes - without pretending to be a 100% accurate account of Escobar's life and times.

 Another Hit For Netflix

 Good show with bad accents

 Entertaining show, solid performances, terrible accents.

 Well developed crime drama series. Season 1 review.
