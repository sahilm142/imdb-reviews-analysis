 Best movie I have seen in my life

 Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie

 Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey

 'Interstellar'

 Excellent Movie

 Glad i didn't watch the trailer

 A Love Story Against The Backdrop Of A Grand Interstellar Travel

 Epic in every way!

 The GENIUS shocks the world by another unique innovation..!!

 A movie made for me

 Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark

 Thought-provoking, mind-enriching, and heart wrenching sci-fi drama.

 time travel= relativity =space equilibrium= Nolan's grand space masterpiece

 "In order for man to move forward, they must leave something behind."

 You will love it or hate it

 Not Just A Class Apart...One of the Best 'Sci-Fi' flicks of all time!

 A Brilliantly Emotional Journey

 Emotional Puzzle

 It is just Incredible

 One viewing may not suffice

 Gem of a Movie!

 Speechless masterpiece!

 It is not Memento, it is not The Dark Knight, it is not Inception. It is Interstellar.

 Absolutely brilliant, a masterpiece, one of the best films ever!

 a rare 10 out of 10 for me
