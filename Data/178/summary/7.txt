 Impressive performances all around

 Brave

 Could have been much better

 Mel Gibson sticks to his guns

 Enjoyable, but almost two different movies

 Mel Gibson still gets his faculties to produce a pleasing blockbuster

 Overrated

 Surprisingly Enjoyable Film

 An era old but not obsolete

 Mixed feelings...

 Well done action v. Coviction

 A very unique war story

 Good Movie, Although A Bit Uneven

 Why didn't the Japanese cut the climbing nets down?

 The best battle scene ever

 Hacksaw Ridge - Movie Review

 Cheesy, Unquestionably Works

 help me get one more..

 Hacksaw Ridge

 That review may contain spoiler

 War film that battles for its own soul

 The Mel Gibson Comeback Movie: Brutal, Hopeful And A Bit Weak

 aw shucks sincerity

 War glamorized

 A great film about a true hero
