If you wanna see movie which has nonstop yelling and arguing this is for you. Seriously I got headache when I was watching this. This movie is so overrated. I don't understand. I had some really big thoughts about this film....and now I'm really disappointed. This is my first review and thats exactly why I'm giving it to this flick.3 Stars because they tried. But everything in this film is messy and stupid. Doesn't make any sense. Like why would that nanny lie about getting hit by car... Whole movie was about it. If she wouldn't lie, there would be no movie.And which I don't understand is people are rating this as 8-10. I bet there's some manipulated ratings...
I read some highly regarded reviews and saw the 8.6 before watching this. Now that I have seen it, its really really boring. I can see why Iranians would like it as there probably is not a lot of quality films made there but man it was boring. By the end I didn't even care what happened. I would have shut it off, but I kept thinking with a 8.6 it HAS to get better. It may be good in Iran, but in the US its really bad. I love a lot of foreign movies from City of god, to I saw the devil. But I wish I had my 2 hours back now. Th characters didn't give me any feeling or emotion AND I have an 11 year old daughter like the main characters. I was glad when it ended and surprised and the 8.6. Very disappointing.
