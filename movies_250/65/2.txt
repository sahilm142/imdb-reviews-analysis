A decent murder mystery is composed of A) unique perplexing crime, followed by B) a unique but insightful solution that allows C) a reconstructed throughline that isn't completely ridiculous. Ideally a smart viewer can play along and pick up clues to assemble the solution but it's not mandatory, and most mysteries from Sherlock Holmes to Sam Spade ignore that last merit. Most movies hope to wow you sufficiently with the solution that you don't go back and test it for believability.Mediocre mysteries always get one of the parts wrong, and it's usually item C. The correctly ordered universe when you piece it together is often silly and overextended beyond belief. And the explained universe is either of no special consequence or composed of absurd or impossible elements.The crime here is so trifling that it doesn't merit the solution or the elaborate smoke-screen. It's so utterly non-complex that one is starved in the end for a surprise/twist, and Christie half-heartedly obliges. Just who are these criminals who can't be bothered to waste an ounce of intelligence on preventing detection, but who stockpile oodles of criminal brilliance and subterfuge for their trial? On top of that, they chose an actress who couldn't pull off the dual role and had to be dubbed.Tyrone Power is looking way old here; too old to be playing a gigolo. Never did I imagine a movie with this title would concern itself with a failed egg-beater inventor... surely one of the most absurd characters ever written. There is no explanation for the generally high ratings this gets here. It's almost completely unremarkable. You can watch this in eleven segments on youtube. This is one of a handful of low points for Billy Wilder.
