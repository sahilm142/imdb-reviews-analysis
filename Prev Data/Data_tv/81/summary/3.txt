 The writing on the show in Season 4 is beyond pathetic and deeply misses Vince Gilligan's brilliance

 Glacial Pacing and Long, Very Drawn Out Episodes Ruin BCS: But S4 Is Much Better!

 "Lost" it's way.

 Painfully Slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...

 Better slow Saul

 Series Getting Dark and Stylishly Annoying

 Far too slow for me to maintain interest.

 Sadly I'm now done with this show. 9/3

 Season 4 is a desaster

 Season 4: Well Here's Another Show That Needs to Be SMOKED!

 Terrible. Just terrible.

 Better call Saul it is not Breaking Bad

 Brilliant and Infuriating at Almost Every Turn
