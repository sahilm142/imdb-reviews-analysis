I understand why people liked them but for me, they were just bland, forgettable, boring & unfunny cartoon characters. I do owe them a gratitude for staying good for 80 years but they didn't offer much towards me.The only good looney tunes episodes & the ones with Roadrunner & Wile.E.Coyote, Bugs Bunny... hate him! Daffy Duck... hate him! Porky Pig... you guessed it I hate him as well! For me Tom & Jerry is the superior old cartoon, it perfected cartoon violence where the Looney Tunes for me were forgettable. If your little, I can't stop you from watching it, you'll probably enjoy but if you hate comedy, this is a definite skip.
