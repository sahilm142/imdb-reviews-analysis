 Slow, Highly Overrated, Interreting, and Disappointing

 Does Anyone GENUINELY Like This?

 boring and artsy

 insufferably boring and egotistical

 Talker

 Better than AVATAR - but that's just my catchphrase.

 Cure for sleepiness

 The most unutterably boring picture I've seen this year.

 Must be some kind of joke.

 Fast forward

 A pompous, interminable bore

 Unless you study cinematography don't bother

 Pure crap for mindless people!

 Terrible!

 Give me my life-time back

 Really bad

 Boring, pointless crap

 Just don't

 Boring

 I beg you, please don't lose your time as I did

 Totally Duped!

 Has not stood the test of time

 Long, boring movie with nothing that even resembles sci-fi

 Cinematography 10...but a movie about nothing

 Worst movie I've ever seen
