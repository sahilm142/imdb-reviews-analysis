 Can't relate to the sensibilities

 good movie

 Solid, but a bit unevenly paced

 GANDHI (DIDIER BECU)

 Impressive biography of one of the most important humans in the history of India

 Solid Biopic

 Noble Effort.

 Serviceable Rather Than Inspired

 Small human, BIG LIFE.

 Good film on a great man

 The South African part

 a good movie, but I expected more.

 Too long

 Gandhi was a complicated man.

 A modern biographic flick on Mahatma Gandhi

 "An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind"

 Above Average, But Not Amazing Biopic

 Interesting but a little boring

 Gandhi the movie, the boundary between genius and documentary.

 A beautiful representation of a great man's story

 A small man who did big deeds

 Gandhi : His triumph changed the world forever

 A good effort to film Mahatma Gandhi and Independence of India

 Beautiful in its storytelling
