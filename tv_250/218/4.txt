I'm obviously in the minority here, but that may be the best reason to speak up.Want to watch a well acted and written drama that followed the lives of a traveling carnival during the dust bowl and depression? Well, you're sort of in luck... unfortunately it will be periodically interrupted by a tired story of good and evil that keeps teasing you with something interesting but never fulfills its promise.I think the biggest reason this was canceled is pacing. Long, drawn out scenes, many of which didn't serve the story being told that could easily have been cut. Wonderful performances, sure, but I kept saying "get on with it already!" I think HBO did, too.
