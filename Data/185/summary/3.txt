 The glorification of a mentally unstable kid who runs away from home

 Cult hero or spoiled, selfish brat?

 Definitely just for an American audience

 Sean Penn Sold Chris McCandless's Soul

 Selfish idiot throws his life away in the wild

 Very poor and disappointing given the high rating on IMDb

 Must be a historical thing?

 A character study of a flawed man

 Idealistic "self-sufficient" character who is in fact a naive and hypocritical parasite

 Angry Young Man Goes to Alaska

 He Should Have Read "To Build A Fire!"

 Tedious

 A cheap counterfeit of real life.

 don't eat the brown acid!

 A music video clip

 Ultimately pointless

 Wasted potential

 Clichés Abound

 Beautifully photographed story about an empty life.

 I could have turned it off, but I had to finish it.

 Into the Wild: What Did It All Prove?

 Mediocre movie with one large question nobody addresses

 Is this a lesson?

 I'm sorry...I thought I'd really like this, but no.

 movie about a spoiled kid...
