 Pixar goes to the fishes

 Overrated

 Overrated, But Still A Good Movie

 Found

 Way overrated.

 Just good (that is: disappointing)

 Under the sea... they have parenting problems as well

 Heartwarming

 Awes you as only a Pixar film can.

 Awes you as only a Pixar film can

 One of the most emotional animated films

 One of the best Pixar offerings

 One of Pixar's finest films, and that is saying a lot

 Not my favorite Pixar film, but it was a nice change from toys and insects

 review

 A flipper picture for all ages

 A movie about . . . fish?

 My 3-year old enjoyed it

 A remarkable animated road film without a road

 Cute characters but too stressful.

 An animated film with both Pixar and Disney qualities

 Great adventure trip for all kids and family

 An underwater coming of age story in gorgeous splashes of color...

 Better than average animated film, but nothing great.

 Cute but not as funny or thrilling as Toy Story
