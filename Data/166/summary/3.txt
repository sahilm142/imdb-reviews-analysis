 Clint Eastwood's character is interesting; the rest is garbage

 Did Eastwood's sense of quality take a holiday?

 We all love Clint Eastwood but can we PLEASE be honest and admit he made a bad movie!?

 Once again the Invasion of the Marketing Shills is launched on IMDb

 stop talking to yourself Clint!

 Make My Day! It Could Be My Last...

 Save yourself the price of admission!

 Dirty Harry Goggles

 One of Eastwood's Worst, Not Best

 Another illogical Eastwood ending

 10 lines about "Gran Torino"

 Rubbish

 Cheesy and awkwardly patronizing

 I was expecting better

 Surprise Surprise...

 What... 8.3 / 10? Seriously? This is a 6 at best.

 Overrated and predictable

 Was this movie serious?

 So many straw men I can't believe the set didn't burst into flames.

 Clint's still got it...
