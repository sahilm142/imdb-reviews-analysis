 Liked it initially, but fades over time

 lazy and/or unrealistic writing, some scenes don't make sense

 Incredulous

 tasteless and bleak

 season five

 A cruel new world

 Sloooooooowwwww

 As expected

 Change of Focus in 2018

 Gross and Disturbing

 Started ok and blew itself up

 From decent to painful in 1 season

 Fictional liberties taken way too far

 Boring, pathetic on the verge of being propaganda

 Hard to watch

 Painful, truly embellished garbage
