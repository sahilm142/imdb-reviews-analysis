 Sci-fi "Mash-up" = Manipulate Another's Stories to Hide Unabashed Plagerism

 This review is for the 2nd season alone, the 1st season is great!

 Could be better

 Poor sequel

 OK for 8-year olds

 Utterly contrived and disappointing

 You can stop watching after S1 ...

 Uncool nerds, are not fun to watch.

 Good Enough to Keep Me Interested, but Still Massively Flawed

 No.

 Not as good as everyone thinks honestly

 Nothing new

 Garbage

 Over-hyped.....but OK

 The Strangest Thing about this show is the weak female characters

 Wheels fall off about 6 episodes into Season two.

 horror material for teenagers

 The "Not So Original" Netflix Original Series

 Dont get it

 Lost

 If u like it see this .
