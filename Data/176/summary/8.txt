 Very interesting movie however it needs some patience from the moviegoer

 Prototypical Ozu

 Simple, but utterly moving

 Tokyo Story Surprises

 exceptionally crafted but depressing

 More of a film to analyse than enjoy

 One of the Best Japanese Films Ever

 A moving and somber picture about time and perspective.

 Alienation and the Family

 Sho-ga-nai wane or Shikata-ganai ??

 Style in TOKYO STORY

 Comparison

 Slightly Overrated

 Respect To Our Parents...

 Engaging and emotional drama from Yasujiro Ozu

 A Family Story
