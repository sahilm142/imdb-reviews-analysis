If you really need a dose of saccharine, go and see Taare Zameen Par. Apart from being an obvious (and far from modest) vehicle for the director himself, it's the most maudlin, pathetic tear-jerker even by Bollywood standards. Most of the actors are complete hams (with the exception of Ishaan himself), with the prize going to Big Brother. The film exploits every stereotype imaginable to the extent that the characters are mere cartoons - one wonders whether the episode where the students draw caricatures of their teachers was intended irony or not. Perhaps the film-makers could have taken a few lessons from Aparna Sen's 15 Park Avenue if they had had any desire to produce something socially conscious and sensitive without the saccharine. Apparently, they didn't.


                
While I applaud the director for tackling the subject of learning disabilities, the movie was totally black/white and not realistic. It is ridiculous to suggest that none of this boy's teachers has a clue what is wrong with him, and only the saintly art teacher can figure it all out. This might be a good movie for children, but the overly simplistic and predictable storyline did not keep my interest. The music was good; it appears that this production was a labor of love for the director, and I think it is a fine introduction to the topic of dyslexia, but I could not get past the rags-to-riches aspect which is not at all true to life.
