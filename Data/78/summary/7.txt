 Age helps final episode of sci-fi saga

 Its fun, but full of holes and inconsistencies

 Am I the only one who thinks this double trilogy to be a tad overrated?

 weakest of the "OT" -- but still a delight

 Not Nearly As Good as the First Two, and a Slightly Disappointing Conclusion...

 The weakest of the original trilogy.

 Lucas, Go Away!!

 From Conclusions and A Redemption

 "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi" comes full circle to wrap up the original saga, and it does so in style.

 Oedipus sibs in Space.

 A Classic, but some silly cheese when looking back as an adult on this...

 The conclusion?

 Not a bad movie but not an awesome movie

 The weakest...

 The trilogy is complete.

 It's alright.

 An inconsistent, yet highly enjoyable, Star Wars film

 The best of the original trilogy, I thought.

 Not as Good as the First Two but Still a Great Movie

 closing with gold key

 A fitting end to a wonderful trilogy

 The most emotional and powerful, but also the weakest and silliest.

 A Soapie in Space

 "It's time to meet the Muppets..."

 Outer Space Fairy Tales
