 One of the most intelligent comedies ever made

 Stunningly funny

 Still one of the funniest films of all time.

 Classic seamless comedy.

 Ave Monty Python!

 One of the top 10 of all time

 Not necessarily laugh-out-loud every minute, but it's satirical edge and wit is as clever as the technical side of the film

 One of my all-time favourites

 The greatest comedic moments in film

 The first time I watched Life of Brian I hardly laughed at all

 Accidentally, it happens to be one of the best critiques of the modern middle east...

 Satirical and cunning farce: you either love it or hate it

 A Comment on Our Gullibility

 The sublime side of life

 Friends, Romans & ex-lepers

 Nothing is sacred

 Simply, the funniest film ever

 If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten...

 He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy

 Probably Monty Python's movie masterpiece...

 Thanks for reaching my innermost funny bone

 A stylistically eclectic comic masterpiece.

 Blessed Are The Cheesemakers.

 Repetitive, no.

 Religiously funny!
