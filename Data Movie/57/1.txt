is this supposed to be a movie of "1984" by George Orwell? if this director or writer made this movie with that intention, it is not bad. but if the director or the writer claims that this is their original? then it is the worst ever. i just can not believe no one talks about that this movie is exactly the same as "1984" novel by George Orwell. every single aspect. fact that the secret police wants to know everything. so they eavesdrop all their conversation. and the list goes on and on... in fact, one person on rotten tomato mentioned about "Brazil" by terry gilliam. Terry also said that he never read the book on an interview. i thought it was the biggest lie. he should really be ashamed of what he made. that is just the biggest bullshit. even if you didn't read the book, other people must have read the book. i can not believe that he didn't get sued for that movie. and this movie is even worse. at least, terry made it to be a little different. but this movie even starts at year 1984. how crazy is that? how can no one see that? and everybody is talking about how creative it is? because George Orwell wrote it 60 years ago. i am just so terrified at north American's inability to read anything and saying what is really creative... what a joke.


                
This movie is too powdered down for me to watch. I tried watching it but can't get past 7 or 8 minuets into the movie. Just watch something better like paint drying.
