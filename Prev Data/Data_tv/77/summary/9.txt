 An Intriguing & Exceptional Anime

 One of the best take on time travel I have ever seen.

 Utterly fascinating

 A gripping story... with a slow start

 Probably one of the best anime out there.

 A truly immersive story with great characters

 Not what I was expecting but turned out pretty good

 A fantastic anime!

 Such an amazing show

 Great storyline and excellent execution.
