 Lacks depth- spoiler alert-mentions a scene from first season

 Overrated, boring Series with excellent costumes and good props

 If this is the world of advertising don't sell it to me

 Did I miss something just then..?

 Rather bad...

 Beautiful but not Bold

 What happened ?

 Up to season 3 is good. Rest is redundant

 Unsteady Drama

 why so many unnecessary sexual scenes?
