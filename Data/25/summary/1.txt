 nauseating

 Life IS beautiful, but I prefer to take the "Train of Life"

 but this film is not

 Schlock at its lowest level

 The most overrated movie of the 90's

 A lie for the naive and ignorant.

 One sure route to the shrink

 A disgusting ego trip that made me feel sick to the pit of my stomach

 A Shining Example of Cinematic Bull****

 No life nor beautiful

 There are two kinds of laughter: Honesty and Ignorance.

 This movie is an insult to anyone who has experienced the real holocaust, not this contrived, farcical version.

 How the reviews for this came in as they did, I can't imagine. I think maybe people like to hear themselves say aloud that they loved a movie with subtitles.

 Overblown and extremely overrated

 Left me with a sick feeling...

 Life wasn't really beautiful...

 Despicable fascist propaganda. Benigni's manges to reach the lowest

 No laughs here

 Overrated movie, with lame jokes

 Total stink

 Yes, but the movie is not

 Poorly directed
