 David Yates managed to kill the end of the series

 Not Harry Potter, but which film have i watched then?

 The wand of destiny the death-stick, the awesome-st branch of doom

 Ostentatious ending to a series that has lost its splendor of originality

 Way to go, Hollywood

 Okay, but disappointing

 Deathly Disappointing

 Nothing but disappointing.

 A middling series ends on a low-point.

 OK but not I'm not Wowed!

 Its OK, not great.

 Good riddance.

 Just like its predecessors

 harry has gone to pot

 Could have been better in so many ways.

 An over hyped film
