 A Good Movie Ruined By Its Ending

 Overrated, predictable, with lots of bad acting by Brad Pitt

 Overrated... Come on. It's good but not a masterpiece! Many PLOT HOLES and utterly predictable!

 Pass me a torch

 Doesn't live up to the hype

 Perhaps..... the most absurdly overrated film on IMDb

 Way over-hyped

 An average one!

 I fell asleep during my first attempt to watch it.

 Predictable, insipid, boring.

 trivial

 I don't know what everyone sees in this movie.
