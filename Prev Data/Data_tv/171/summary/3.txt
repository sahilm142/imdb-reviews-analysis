 and then this loverboy bishop in season 5 with his gucci model hairstyle - just awful

 An American try on European history....

 What happened with this series?

 Silly soap opera for the uneducated masses

 Another great show ruined

 Went downhill

 Good idea messed up

 Only small spoilers and a serious NOT GOOD

 Going downhill with high speed

 It was great

 Historical inaccuracies - Oh the humanity!

 Season 4 is a mess

 I should have reviewd earlier

 high school play.

 overrated series

 A TV show with no real dialogues anymore

 What in the living f...

 No real story to tell

 A waste of time

 Decent story and acting, but lame overall script

 it used to be great...

 Oh my God(s)

 Every season it gets worse.

 An insult to history

 Amazingly bland, already seen Hollywood writing dressed with some historical flair
