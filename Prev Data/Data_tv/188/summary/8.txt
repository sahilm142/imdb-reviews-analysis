 Largely Unbelievable, Thoroughly Entertaining

 Luther

 Gripping, Breathtaking, Climatic, Dark with Excellent "Villains"

 Excellent Crime Drama

 A quality show that grows on you

 ..you'll watch without her.. but it will not be the same..

 Has all the good reasons to watch this psychological crime series, especially Elba

 Idris Elba is great

 Great series!

 Fast and Fun

 Another great season for Luther

 Started strong

 Brilliant series...

 High Quality Cop Show For TV Tuned Audiences!

 Attractive due to great acting

 Twists and turns like you'd never expect em.

 Must watch

 Distinctive, pity that 3 short seasons only

 Fantastic Thriller with believable acting

 Great show but...

 A dark series gets darker still...Fantastic!

 Gritty and nice change from US Centric dramas

 Season 1-4 where FANTASTIC season 5 is Good but could have been better

 High production but ...

 Glad to see it Back
