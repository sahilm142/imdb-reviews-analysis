 Edgy, politically incorrect...hilarious

 GREAT Show!

 One of the funniest shows on TV

 This show will go down as the funniest show of the decade

 Absolutely hilarious

 Funny as hell and Chappelle is a great comedian

 Chappelle Canceled?

 GREAAAAAAT!!!!!!!!!!!

 Only lasted two seasons, but some very funny material was thought up for that time

 Oh -- My Gosh!!

 About the only show on TV that honestly talked about race and other topics others were afraid to discuss.

 He should definitely host Saturday Night Live.

 You'll Laugh Till You Hurt

 Little southern white girl. And I LOVE this show.
