 An Absolute Delight!

 This child is SPECIAL!

 Like Stars on Earth: life lessons (!)

 Outstanding - Mr. Khan, stand up and take a bow !

 Best movie of 2007

 An Emotional Film, but High Repetition

 A surprisingly good Bollywood family film

 Will make a good parent out of you!!!!

 Not Crazy about it.

 Brilliant! in its own unique way

 Good movie ! But it suffers and have lot more space to develop !

 The last half an hour were the best
