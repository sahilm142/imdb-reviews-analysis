 DC Finally Got It Right. This Is A Grittier And Darker Batman Story

 Batman has truly begun!

 All about Bale.

 And i thought the Combination of Tim Burton and Michael Keaton was as good as its gonna get?

 Dark, Brooding and Stunning.

 Captures the tone perfectly. A+

 Got to see it early

 I've never had a thing for Batman films. I can't wait until the next one!

 The greatest Bat film ever, possibly the best comic book film of the 21st century

 Buts SpiderMan to shame....

 New Beginning

 The way Batman was MEANT to be!

 The Best Superhero Film of the Decade ... so far

 The real Batman

 Now I know what you're thinking...

 Batman whips out his bat-balls!

 A triumphant infusion of character and return to grandeur for the franchise

 Batman Begins

 One of the Best of Batman series so far produced !

 Wow!

 Refreshing!

 I had basically forgotten there was a time Batman movies were great!

 never was a big batman fan but........THIS BLEW ME AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!

 The best movie of 2005

 I actually clapped when the credits rolled - so did about 10 other people
