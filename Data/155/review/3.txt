Who knew a film named "Blade Runner", a movie with such high praise, could be so boring. TBH, I stopped paying attention halfway though, and surfed the web on my phone. Blade Runner's lone quality is it looks great. As with Alien, it does everything a sci-fi movie should do. Its dark, its detailed, and shows off the culture and technology.Other than that? As an action film, its abysmally paced, with no special scenes or charismatic characters. As a "deep, philosophical" film...I don't buy it. You can't support your themes without strong characters. And Blade Runner's entire cast is uninteresting. It may have been intentional for them to be lifeless and robotic, but this movie didn't make me care about machines. Why even bother answering the questions this movie supposedly asks? "Is genetic engineering ethical? What makes us human?" Who cares? I don't care anymore after this film than I did before.The noir romantic relationship had zero impact on me. Just as typical and shallow as any other relationship from the genre. But I suppose its okay, since Scott meant to do that. *eye rolls* Its another sci-fi classic that seems like it can get away with anything if its shot well and merely mentions its themes. I'm not going to give it a second chance.


                
Ridley Scott is a legendary filmmaker, his body of work is exception. 'Blade Runner', which is now known to be a Cult Classic by many, in my opinion, is Scott's weakest effort. 'Blade Runner' is based on a epic battle between genetically engineered beings called replicants & and a semi-retired blade runner. It takes place in 2019, 9 years from now, well it seems like a boring future. Let's not forget the that 'Blade Runner' was a box office disaster when originally released. Some films are lucky to earn Cult Status, & this sci-fi flick is surely one of them. Scott's direction is not up-to the mark, mainly because the script is filled with loose ends. Cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth is worth a mention, his work is great. In the acting department, Harrison Ford has always been a competent actor, and his performance here proves that fact yet again. Rutger Hauer is okay. Others are plain average.All said n done from this writer, 'Blade Runner' is a overrated classic. A debacle, compared to it's hype. Thumbs Down!


                
A few points: 1. The fantastic visual effects we see occupy the film for the briefest of moments. They don't really factor into the story AT ALL, other than just as a reminder that indeed, this story takes place in the future. As one other person pointed out, the ENTIRE film takes place at night, and if it's technically daytime out, then every scene is suddenly indoors. You just never see the light of day. The initial title sequence and score is GREAT, but it's like it's all meant for some other storyline/film.2. What kind of future is this? Outside of a few gadgets like the Void-Kampf machine (which might as well be a polygraph), and perhaps the darkening technology that we see in Mr. Tyrell's penthouse, the only other examples of advanced technology are the spinner cars, Deckard's gun (maybe), and the replicants themselves...which as far as I can tell and the movie relates, aren't really androids, but rather, test-tube humans grown in a lab with bioengineered short lifespans. Not exactly advanced robotics. Other than their physical strength (which seems misused as none of them seem to know anything about fighting, even Roy, and their strength really just doesn't feature in the story much other than them beating up on Deckard a few times), they might as well BE humans. Honestly the plot makes more sense if they weren't replicants in the robotic sense, but the bioengineered test-tube humans I've suggested. This is all the more apparent by Roy's discussion with Tyrell over extended his lifespan, when all that they discuss are cell structures and virus chain molecules, etc, etc...clearly suggesting that the 'replicants' are simply test-tube humans. Another thing I didn't get is the fact that the replicants bleed like any other human when injured, so again, not exactly robots. And, why does a combat-model replicant experience extreme pain when driving a nail into his hand, but not when he gets hit in the head with a crowbar, or when he drives his head through a wall? It's like the story only fits whatever it's trying to accomplish per scene.....Continuing on with the 'future' thing, Why is virtually everything so utterly retro? Contemporary technology (ceiling fans, TV sets, radios, late model cars, etc) can be seen all throughout the film, giving you the idea that this 'future' is really just an alternate reality set in current day (for 1982). No attempts are really made to depict giant viewscreens, small devices that were if anything, predicted even in the 80's... Other than the brief visual FX we see (point#1), they should well have just set this story in today's world. There's really no reason anything that we see in the movie couldn't well have taken place today. The film completely wastes its futuristic setting.3. The suggestions that Deckard is a replicant are stupid. The movie goes out of its way to depict Roy and Rachael's persons as the pinnacle of replicant technology, but Deckard is just as weak as any other human. The question has to be asked WHY would you even create a replicant as frail as a normal human if indeed his job was to hunt other replicants who can hand him his own arse in a fight? It would make more sense that ROY was a Blade Runner. Additionally, if anyone is going to know what Deckard is, it's Tyrell, and yet he interacts with Deckard in a standard way, and even the other replicants treat Deckard as they would a human. I also didn't observe anything Deckard's character does in the film as 'good', in that he displays no apparent skills at tracking down replicants that any other cop wouldn't have. His chief calls him in out of semi-retirement saying he wants the old magic, but other than getting himself beat up half the time and being super-lucky the other, I don't get it.4. It seems kinda stupid that if these replicants are prone to escaping (indeed, they have cops specifically tasked with tracking them down), then it would make sense maybe to have some sort of remote control switchoff device or something? It's like, hey, this is the far future where mankind is apparently out exploring other planets outside our solar system, but we can't keep a handle on the numbered and created replicants? If they're gonna design them with limited lifespans, why not a kill switch or something else? Ack, makes no sense.5. About the only thing that makes any real sense in this story is Rachael discovering that she's not actually human. They could have done something with that. Perhaps make an entire story centered around her character learning this tidbit, then her trying to extend her life after going through all the emotional trauma, and then being hunted down by a blade runner. It would accomplish everything this movie was trying to tell, but failed at.6. Indeed, there's really no explanation why the replicants themselves are so utterly violent and psychopathic. This isn't in their programming. Leon is an ammunition loader programmed to take orders and designed for his strength, Pris is a pleasure model. Only Roy and Zora are combat oriented, yet as such, they would likely be level-headed and cautious. It's kinda odd that all of them so easily transcend their 'programming' and pretty much go around killing everyone they encounter. Instead of killing Tyrell, the best outcome I could have seen for Roy upon learning that he can't extend his life is to maybe just enjoy his remaining days, or the scene end with him sobbing uncontrollably like a child, and maybe for Tyrell to take pity on him and turn him off some other way, or maybe to show him that via other models, Roy's memories might live on in a way. Something...jeez.
Saw it 20 years ago, and couldn't wait to get out of the theater.Saw it again tonight, director's cut, better, but still so boring.Yes, the style and images, and photography are excellent. But I also like a good story. It's funny, so many people are saying this is the classic sci-fi film. Perhaps,although I believe there are at least 20 sci-fi films that are better. But at the heart of this movie it's just a basic detective film. And as a detective story film, it is not interesting enough.Nor are too many of the characters. Most seem to be sleepwalking. Anyway, save your money and your time.


                
I just don't understand how this movie has such a high rating (8.3).I've read several of the reviews posted on this site to try and understand what makes this movie so great. Most people who give this movie a good rating all say the same thing. The movie makes you think on some deep philosophical questions. This is quoted from a review by joelhoff. "Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence." I think that every bit of that is BS. Technological and capitalistic excess would also be said of us right now by people who lived 50 years ago. Not all technological advances are considered excess. The roles of creator and creation and their role reversal. There is no role reversal. The replicants died. They didn't triumph. A triumph for the replicants would have been a normal life span, which is why the sought out their creator. The nature of humanity is not emotion, memory, purpose, blah blah. If you look through a few history books you'll see the nature of humanity is about power. The most powerful live and and the weak die. I'm sure most will consider this a very cynical viewpoint but do you honestly believe that the powerful care about your emotions. The meaning of existence is death.The only thing that made me stop and think was when Deckard went from calling Rachael an "it" to asking her if she loved him. His character went from believing her to be worthless tool to wanting to protect her. But then again, the movie did not show any relationship development between the two, so that was completely unexpected and a bit insincere.I don't believe this to be a great sci fi movie. At best it is average and at worst useless.
First let's get something straight. I am 17 and the only reason I watched this was for school. This movie was made 30 years ago and somehow I don't think teenage males were the target audience, so if I actually enjoyed this movie it would be a miracle.That being said there are a few factors you can simply judge a movie on to determine whether or not it's good. One of them would probably be character development. Another would probably how well the story is told. Well the main character is given no back story whatsoever and spends the all but the last 10 minutes either apathetic, bored or startled (sidenote: the best bladerunner ever was nearly killed easily twice?). The antagonists are portrayed as evil right up until the last 10 minutes. Not misunderstood or desperate, just evil. The only time they are portrayed as desperate it comes off more as dire manipulation; oh and the desperation is portrayed by the actors saying "we're desperate" with sad looks. THIS IS NOT GOOD CHARACTERISATION. Antagonists can be evil...in comic books and Michael Bay movies. There is literally a scene where they find a genetic engineer working in a freezing environment and they strip him of his coat and then interrogate him while he freezes to death...for no conceivable reason (especially seeing as it took the guy twice as long to tell them the important information as he shivered)I have not yet spoken to one person who could understand what was going on until they watched it twice. Well...sort of twice. None of those people managed to actually finish the movie in their first viewing.Up until now I have tried to stay away from saying exaggerated things. But seriously...this might be the worst portrayal of the future I have seen. I mean honestly it just seemed like they made a list of cultural things, then just went the opposite way.All in all I have 3 stars instead of 1 because the ending is good (if a bit forced with the dove/soul metaphor). But as many other reviews say: 10 good minutes at the end do not make up for 2 hours of crap.
It has no introduction, and no ending. A film full of non-sense. That's the impression it gave me after I had to endure the torture and watch it. It has been recommended to me by a big number of friends, all of them saying its a great film. What? Are we talking about the same title? This is the Blade Runner review I'm typing right? I hope I don't write this on a wrong title. Someone please tell me the purpose of this movie. Were people really that impressed of graphics those days when this "movie" came out?! I simply cannot see the reason it was created, i didn't get the storyline at all, if there ever was any. It's a complete waste of time. A HUGE disappointment !! I DO NOT recommend it, at all !


                
As a piece of visual art, Blade Runner is very impressive. The problem is that it never gets around to telling a good story. The story that is there is extremely drawn out, and depressing. It is a slow, boring, melodramatic movie that has very little humanity (which is part of the premise), and nothing for the viewer to care about. It's a pretentious, navel-gazing art house film dressed up as a sci-fi/film noir thriller. Vangelis's score is sometimes praised, but really not very good. Aside from a few good moments, he's mostly playing weak jazz and blues on synthesizers, or somber piano music. As science fiction, it's kind of interesting in retrospect to see what predictions it got right, and what it got wrong. In Blade Runner's 2019, smartphones and flat screen TVs have not been invented, but androids and flying cars have. The Terminator, which came out two years later and had a similar (but crucially different) concept, is a much better movie on almost every front, both as a story and as science fiction, although it had a smaller budget and less impressive visuals.It's not hard to see why Blade Runner flopped at the box office, despite the pedigree it had. Word of mouth could not have been good. The fact that it's been resurrected in critical estimation is entirely about the visual imagery it created, which was, to be fair, mind-blowing for the time and extremely influential on later films. But that shouldn't mislead people into thinking it was a good movie. It wasn't. Its rating on this site is way, way too high. Be warned.*POSSIBLE SPOILER*The entire film is basically the examination of a concept: "If robots started to develop emotions, what would that be like?". That's it. It just dwells on that question in excruciating, overwrought, detail for two hours. The plot is paper thin, and an afterthought to the real point of the movie, which seems to have been the visual imagery. The word I used above is how I would sum it up: excruciating. It would probably be a better movie if you watched it with the sound off, and some electronic music playing.
Blade Runner has a very weak story line, a slow pace, and poor character development. Its reliance upon special effects and scenery reminds me of the first Star Trek movie, which had similar weaknesses.For me to enjoy a movie, it is important that I care about the characters. Ironically, the only one I cared about even a little was the replicant, Rachael. Until she meets Deckard, she is unaware that she is a replicant, and this knowledge is a blow to her. The desire for a manufactured being to be a real human is reasonably well portrayed, but better examples are Pinocchio,and Commander Data of Star Trek TNG. What is unclear to me is why Rachael would bother saving Decards life - he has no personality or redeeming features. I also find a couple of aspects of the ending unbelievable. It is illogical and out of character for Roy Batty to prolong the fight with Deckard, especially when Deckard starts to inflict serious damage to him. His saving Deckard and his dying speech are similarly ridiculous. And when Deckard and Rachael escape the nasty LA scene for they mountains, I wondered why would anyone stay in LA if that is an option?If you want to see an engaging well made movie of a Phillip K Dick story, I recommend Minority Report instead.
This movie was said to work on so many levels.  Who the hell said that?  The same guy who liked Speed 2?  Total Recall is a superior movie - and Total Recall is an average movie. No wonder it flopped when it originally came out.  This is cultish and trendy to find Blade Runner so appealing, much in the same way that so many people find The Goonies or Rocky Horror Picture Show as excellent cinema. 
It's mob appeal.  This movie, Blade Runner, is completely below average. Don't buy into the hype.  I did and regret it.


                
I just don't know where to begin. I've watched this movie for the first time yesterday (The final Cut) and my mouth fell open with pure disbelief. How did i waste 2 hours of my life on this piece of drab film noir. Really, it is that bad. I do not have to talk about how beautiful the decors are, or were for that matter (we are 30 years on and it's quite impressive for the time it was shot), and even better looking than some of the earlier CGI movies. But who cares if the movie plot is totally ridiculous and sucks in every way possible. The reviews i have read here are all completely beyond me. How can people possibly overlook all the gaps in the plot. No character building whatsoever. Bad acting, unbelievable and ridiculous storyline. And it's not mediocre. No it's just all bad. Deckard's hunt for the replica's? I don't believe him, nor do i believe all of the other characters who feel totally forced into roles and extremely bad writing. It's beyond me how someone can get sucked in to this movie nor the protagonist. There is no hunt. There is no excitement. Nothing is thrilling. And o my god how predictable can a movie be??? Not to mention the agonizingly stupid view on the future. I don't want to play captain hindsight here but the movie is set in 2019. Which makes it even more painful to watch. Flying cars everywhere but then stopping for a payphone?! I could have handled this if the movie was done better. I mean i like Sci-Fi, but not this kind. Everything is dark, the streets should be crowded but are all empty. And the so called 'decors' they look like decors. Normally i wouldn't write a review because everyone has already done it and there is just not much to add to all the reviews already written. But in this case i want to act as a counterweight to everyone here who rates this movie with a 9 or a 10. Why. Have they been watching the Ultimate Cut which i haven't seen? I'm sorry for not delving to deep into the details but just believe me. If you are a normal film lover, not sleeping under star trek sheets with a Spock poster above your bed, please let this one be. It's a classic alright. A classic peace of poo....


                
So this is based of the book "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", and yet there are not even any electric sheep in it! What happened to all the symbolism? I feel like they just excavated the substance from the book, and just made an empty robot-hunting movie. It was a very clinical approach to a movie which may have otherwise had something to say.Now, I'm not suggesting you go read the book, which isn't even good, but at least it tried to be about something, unlike this movie, which just doesn't & isn't. Isn't about anything, that is.It amazes me how this movie can secure such a high rating. My gosh! Oh, well, on second thought, maybe there are sheep in this movie after all. And they're in the audience.


                
I have seen this movie three times, or at least tried to see it three times, but the first two times I fell asleep. Yesterday I finally managed to sit through the whole film and this is what I noticed.I think the whole movie can be described as a long sequence of very good (for an 80's movie) special effects and great camera work. Ford and the rest of the cast gives adequate performances, but where is the plot in this movie. Nothing happens. I can understand why I fell asleep the first two times.Rating: 3/10


                
The text intro to the film might give you the idea that it's going to question the ethics of slavery. Is it ethical to use artificial humans beings as slaves? Is it ethical to have them murdered when they rebel? But these questions are never addressed. Instead you get a film where the hero kills without question, showing only a hint of remorse once through its entirety. Add to that the most anti-climactic ending in existence and you've got a real "Wha?" film. OK, so it's not what I was expecting. Well, the whole style of the movie - the music, the setting, the characters - everything oozes film noir. If you expect that, I guess you won't be too disappointed. But do you get sixty minutes of atmospheric shots spliced in between twenty five minutes of conversation that seems to leading up to something (but surprise! never does) and five minutes of two confusing fight scenes. I'll give Blade Runner credit, though: the setting is visionary, convincing and appropriately claustrophobic. I had no problem getting absorbed into the retro sci-fi setting, but maybe that's just me. The acting is just good as well, but Harrison Ford's narration is dry and robotic for some reason. Seems out of place in a film where he acts perfectly fine everywhere else. But the bottom line is this film toys with your mind. It makes you think each event is leading up to something when nothing ever does. ******SPOILER ALERT****** And the scene in the apartment? Is Ford trying to rape the female replicant? It's really hard to understand what's going on there. He gets hot over her, tries to make a move, she tries to escape, he stops her and makes her say she wants it. And at the end of the movie they ride off in the sunset like lovers. Strange behavior for a hero character, I must say. ******SPOILER ALERT END******Well, that's it. Watch it on television if you must, but don't expect much. Hell, go play Deus Ex or Beneath a Steel Sky and enjoy your cyberpunk for a change.
I found the movie bizarre and hard to follow. The plot, I'm sure, was good, if they hadn't clouded it with drawn out drama scenes and poor music. (I found the music particularly irksome). I thought the acting was alright, in general. It had a few funny lines, and a few thought provoking lines in the script. I thought SOME of the cinematography was alright, however most of it was not real eye-catching. I did like the ending somewhat. I liked the monologue at the end. But all in all it wasn't the best I've seen. Futuristic movies interest me, and this one just didn't cut it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who is in a good mood.


                
what a waste of time!!I think this movie could well be a sure shot way to cure insomnia!!The only thing worse than this movie is the fact that i waited weeks(probably months) to watch this!!I am totally shocked by all the reviews and ratings it has gotten(supposedly).Well the one thing worth seeing was Harrison ford's suave style(well,if you had to pick a silver lining out of this dark(est) cloud).I mean to think that this sort of unwatchable,disturbing thing be inflicted upon the world is sad. So anyone who lives in the real world,my advice to you is : don't waste your time on this.


                
The truly wonderful and under-appreciated talent of Rutger Hauer make this movie worth watching even though you have to suffer through the mawkish wooden acting of Harrison Ford (how did that guy make a movie career!?). Special effects, flying machines, settings, weird little creatures and aliens were totally stolen from the original Star Wars. There was a pretty good story in there but it was hard to sift through all the annoying distractions to get to it. Rutger Hauer was the only actor who projected any kind of meaning into his character. Of course, there's always the possibility that was part of the director's intent. These comments are on the director's cut of the movie so I don't know what the "other" ending is. Also, I've not read the book, so I don't know if that would make a difference.


                
Could barely go through the two hours. Pacing is a major issue (too slow).To be fair, I had high expectations sitting to watch this (it being in the top 250 list). Utterly disappointed with the lack of substance, plot, dialogue and the quality of overall viewing experience. I question its place in the top with the other greats.While I liked the visuals and one particular concept (avoiding a spoiler here), all the rest was wasted on me. My three stars suggest that this is not my type of film, which is quite surprising to myself as I generally can bear with a lot of mediocre slow paced films as well. There is not enough communication through the film to the audience to make a connection and quite frankly I cannot even consider a second view for the fear of going through the same two hours again.If you like Sci-Fi or Noir films, look for other options. If you like good movies, look for other options. If you want to tell others that you have seen this movie or if you really want to see this yourself before you can make your mind about it, well, you have been warned.


                
It's kind of slow, boring, and repetitive. It has this awkward narration from Harrison Ford, like an old noir movie. I watched this as a fan of Bubble Gum Crisis, which plagiarized a lot from this movie. Despite the cringe narration, I liked Harrison Ford's character. He was like Humphrey Bogart. A bit too much like Humphrey Bogart. I honestly don't get why people love this movie so much. It doesn't actually have a lot of action, and they keep repeating that first Replicant attack over and over. I would think a veteran blade runner would wear some futuristic body armor under his clothes. Criticisms aside, The setting is really interesting. I like futuristic settings.
This is my first full movie review, probably ever. This will be a record of what I honestly feel about the film following my first ever full viewing of it. Judging from a few I've read, I'm not alone in thinking this film is insanely overrated.I viewed the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray and I have to say, I don't get it. The scores I mean, and the general positivity surrounding this film. I went in without paying any attention to these things until after the viewing, only really knowing that the film garnered a fairly large cult following years later.So, to summarise the plot in my own words here, as I know people will likely point to people criticising the film as "not understanding it's deep and utter complexity", here we go.Deckard is a former supposedly high ranking Blade Runner, an individual that is part of law enforcement in the year of 2019, whose purpose is to hunt down rogue "Replicants", these being hyper-realistic androids that look, sound and act almost exactly like humans. Replicants are sent off to various locations for slave labour in this universe.Deckard is forced out of retirement by a higher up, as a handful of dangerous Replicants have managed to escape their slavery and have come back to earth to attempt to find their creator, and extend their lifespan, as Replicants are created to live very short lives.That's a basic summary, but is really all the film ever tells us about what is happening, ever, there's no evolution beyond this, no twists to keep us hooked. The pacing is so painfully slow that there's few details to divulge at all, aside from this summary. This is the concept and story of the film with a LOT of pointless quiet time splitting things up to extend run time and probably just to keep the budget below a certain threshold. Take it or leave it, love it or hate it.To get a bit more in depth on what actually transpires, there are a few gripes I have that I'd like to cover, which will be most relevant obviously to those that have seen the film.Firstly, why in the hell are you sending one man out against multiple dangerous renegade, SUPER strong androids that are on the loose, with little to nothing to go on whatsoever? Well that's not totally true, The chief has digital photographs of what these escaped Replicants look like in his office that he shows to Deckard, and you aren't sending out squadrons of heavily armed officers attempting to capture them? Why not?Secondly, Deckard is made out to be some "incredible" Blade Runner. The higher up/Chief, Bryan, that recruits him for the task, goes as far as to blackmail him into doing so when Deckard initially declines. Bryan apparently does all this because they "need his magic".They kick up so much of a fuss about how incredibly talented of a Blade Runner he is, but in just about every encounter, he's a complete mess, and is more often than not just landing on his back with blood pouring from his mouth. WHY doesn't he have backup with him to locate these Replicants? It's a massive, gaping plot hole that is never addressed or explained in any way, we're just meant to accept that it is this way because "movie has to happen", despite it making absolutely no sense.The actual visuals of this film are by far the best part of it. For a film that's over 30 years old, it looks great. Granted, this is largely remastered for a HD blu-ray release, but the sets, costumes etc. largely stand the test of time. This is about the most generous praise I can give the film.The Replicants themselves act just as brain dead at times, particularly the primary blonde haired duo, whose names I cannot recall beyond their mention at the very beginning. These two have the goal of tracking down their creator. Eventually they do so whilst manipulating one of their "lesser designers", JF Sebastian, forcing him to allow them access to their creator's penthouse.The blonde haired male, who is pretty much the leader of these renegade replicants, goes alone with Sebastian to speak with his creator, and after requesting that his life be extended, he's basically told "Yeah, I'm sorry but that can't be done, you're made to last this long and that's that", then ends up gouging out his eyes, and killing Sebastian, for no reason, off screen.The male is an absolute joke at the very end, smashing his head into walls basically acting like Jack from The Shining in the most pointlessly drawn out attempt to kill someone I've probably ever seen, even going so far as to strip off his clothes for zero reason to make it even more comical.The blonde haired female, is given the literal most perfect opportunity to kill Deckard, because let's be honest, it seems like anyone could judging from his ineptitude in this movie, but I guess she decided she hadn't done enough backflips so she decides to let him go to get his gun and blow her guts out. Why?Not to mention, these are androids. Synthetic beings. Who thought it would be a great idea to have their innards and blood colour be totally indistinguishable from ordinary humans? Something tells me that will just make it harder to narrow down any escapees. Maybe the creator wanted it to be this way, but perhaps regulation should have opposed the idea, or at least create a law that has some mandatory design implementation to where they can be easily identified immediately if they get loose? Doesn't really matter in the end I guess, because nothing about it is ever mentioned or built upon whatsoever.How on earth is this film deep? It's a collection of non-sensical, illogical events that try so hard to make you think on some kind of deeper level, but they just totally fail. There's no mystery, these are renegade machines that are designed to be as human as possible, but aren't, with an inept agent attempting to capture them, and only succeeding due to pure luck.If I have more to add I will do so but there's really nothing much more to talk about, it's one of the slowest films I've ever seen that tries to make you think during the periods where nothing is happening, but it more often than not leads nowhere, or it leads into another problem and something else to complain about and just ask, "why?"Final score from me is 3/10, mostly on account of how the film looks and its general visual presentation.
I watched the movie as a teenager not long after it first came out and remember being disappointed. I got a hold of the dvd and so I checked it out, wondering if I my opinion would change at this point. The answer is no, it wouldn't. Yes, visually it is awesome. I even liked the music so much I went out and bought the cd. However, the movie itself is still disappointing. I actually had a hard time sitting through it. The story had some really good things going for it, but because of the extremely dark tone and the slow pace I found it somewhat nauseating- especially the graphic bits with eyeballs. Many people seem to like this one so it may be worth your taking a look even if just for the look of this film. As a total movie, if you like dreary, non-moving works, you may well think of it as a masterpiece.


                
Only 12.43% of the movie had action on it! It was all Chit-Chat-Chit-Chat-Chit-Chat-Chit-Chat-Chit-Chat BANG! Chat.I expected a lot more of this movie.The so-called "Finaliser" came and I expected a good fight but NO! It was all, Villain chase Hero through a building and Villain dies of old age! How Boring! Suppose why your wondering I gave it a 3 and not 1. The FEW fights on this movie was good.It was really bad movie, I just wasted a good 9.50 buying the DVD.There 3/10 for blade runner.
This is a review of the DIRECTOR'S CUT or EXTENDED CUT of this film. I have not seen the theatrical release.Let me first say, I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love films that take time to build mood and atmosphere, I love the "cyberpunk" setting (which I understand this film was a pioneer of in many respects, so to that, I give it credit), and I love films that aren't afraid to dive into deeper philosophical waters. So why did I walk away so bitterly disappointed?The film starts out promising - the world that serves as the backdrop for this story is beautifully crafted and visually stunning, and the soundtrack only adds to its shadowy intrigue. We are introduced to Replicants, A.I. that are essentially on par with humans as far as intelligence and appearance, as well as the Blade Runners that hunt them when they "go rogue". We are also introduced to the film's most interesting character, Rachel, a Replicant who has had false memories programmed into her and believes herself to be human. Unfortunately, although Rachel and Deckard's interactions comprise the most interesting parts of the movie, they take up very little screen time.INSTEAD, the film follows Deckard around as he orders food, looks disgruntled while sitting in a bar, questions people, and finally tracks down four different rogue replicants. This is where I realized the film wasn't going anywhere: there's a shortage of compelling or realistic characters. Each character in this film felt either uninspired or REALLY hammy. The first replicant Deckard finds is posing as an exotic dancer (got to keep your audience's attention somehow, right?) and after a brief chase is shot down. It's a scene that I'm sure was supposed to make me question Deckard's morality as well as the humanity of replicants, but because I was so uninvested in both of the characters I really didn't care and found the whole scene as a gimmicky attempt to try to elicit audience emotion.Another replicant who is equally uninteresting runs around with all the nuance of a WWE performer until he's prompty shot, while the other two replicants who take up much of the remaining screen time are god-awful. There's a former hooker android who convinces a Tyrell employee to take her home and then proceeds to dress up like a coked out David Bowie who got lost in a Hot Topic. Of course, the house she hides in is littered with "creepy" dolls and clown robots - there's even robots dressed up as militarized clowns who welcome them at the door. It felt like a really uninspired and silly attempt to try to create something unsettling or distinct. The hooker goth replicant eventually changes up her style and dresses up like a doll to try to trick Deckard (who could have seen THAT coming?!) and then backflips around the room like a lunatic before she's unceremonious shot a bunch of times. It was hilarious.The final replicant felt like a waste. His story has so much potential - an android who's trying to locate his creator in order to override his cruelly truncated lifespan - but NOPE, forget subtlety, lets dress him like a 40-year-old who's trying out for an Alternative Rock band and have him deliver his lines like a caricature of a Hollywood villain. The ending was laughably bad. The replicant is running around like a melodramatic weirdo, chasing Deckard around, shoving his head through walls with no purpose other than to deliver ridiculous dialogue, jumping around the rooftop in just a pair of jean-shorts- and it all culminates in the laziest attempt at symbolism I've seen in a long time: he literally shoves a nail through one hand and grabs a wild dove in the other, then proceeds to run around like that (yes, dove in hand like a g-dd-amm werido) for the last 5 minutes of his scenes until he dies. Yup. SO LONG, DOVE WIELDING ROOF-JUMPING EYELINER GUY, YOU'VE BEEN GREAT.Overall I was really disappointed. I felt like this movie had an amazing premise and source material to draw from, fantastic visuals, lighting, soundtrack, etc, - but BOY did they miss the mark with what actually mattered. Maybe I would have gotten more out of it if I had watched it 10, maybe 15 years ago when the idea of A.I. consciousness was a lot more novel, but unfortunately, I doubt even that would have saved it. What a bummer.
I have to say, I ama big fan of PKD's novel "Do Andrpids Dream of Electric Sheep" which this film was a retelling of.It might as well not be. Every single philosophical theme from the novel was excluded and instead replaced by long, dull scenes where nothing happens.No character from this movie was ever examined, no motivations were given and no character progression happened. The whole subplot with religion and mood organs was excluded. Those were the things that actually mattered.The replicants aren't supposed to be murdering machines. That's not the point, In the novel there's a clear motive behind why they need to be killed and we can sympathize with them. Here, they're just regular bad guys.The biggest offender, that actually made me turn the movie off, was the Luba Luft assassintion scene. Or whatever she was called in the movie. The whole android police force part was ommited from the story as well as development of the android. Instead , all we got was a nude scene, followed by a chase scene and Deckard killing her mercilessly in a minute. Then it was like it never happened.I don't know what happened after that and I frankly don't want to. I don't want to see the novel butchered completely.
