 Just another Oliver Stone Flick

 A series of build-ups with no climax...

 One of the most overrated films ever produced

 See Apocalypse Now instead

 An army man is caught between his two generals one righteous and other who believes ends justify the means.

 History Distorted

 A mediocre "Nam" movie with an awesome cast
