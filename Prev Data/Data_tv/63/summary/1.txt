 Heads and Tails

 I miss The Simpsons

 Horrible Soap Opera Has Run It's Course

 Did You Ever Have the Feeling That You Wanted To Go, But Still You Had The Feeling That You Wanted to Stay?

 How I lost respect

 This show...

 Very Boring, and on TV for way too long.

 OH NO! "The Simpsons" have caught "Ren and Stimpy syndrome"!

 To Recap, Rich People Bad, The Rest Are Idiots, Except Liberals

 Can't wait till it ends

 Nothing special...

 We are late for church, kids

 The Simpsons is rapidly becoming the worst animated show on TV

 This was even called "good"?

 comedy is to easy.

 Episode "A Tree Grows in Springfield" Season 24 Episode 6

 Don't waste your time on it.
