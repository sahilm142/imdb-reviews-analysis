 Beautiful but barren...

 Intense

 I liked it because of its style

 But lots of room for dead ones

 Over-analyzed and over appreciated, it starts out being one thing and then goes off into another world

 Let's stop giving genius credit to abrupt endings with loose ends

 Good not Great

 Overrated

 Solid movie, liquid performances, eventually turns to gas.

 Bad. Very bad. Bad men and a story line that was worse than bad.

 A Very Unique Experience

 Hidden loot, running far

 So Bleak, So Good

 I don't understand why they did it.

 Why don't we just not end the picture and say we did?

 it is good...but not that good

 Disappointed

 nihilistic escapism

 No Film for Fans of a Tidy Ending...............

 It's good enough to be great

 Meandering and somewhat derivative, but still interesting

 This unfortunately ain't not "Fargo".

 Not all its cracked up to be . . .

 Something missing

 A great life cycle of human in now a day
