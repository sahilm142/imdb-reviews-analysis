Warning - Spoiler! Beautiful show till last year. Now all the action that takes place is inside a book. Madara unleashed the infinite dream: Tsunade was captured and is currently in a dream where she is reading a book and in that book we have see what she is reading. I mean seriously all of this is meaningless to the hole show. Really? I mean Really, REALLY?? Basically Madara won and now we see that they all are dreaming...and nothing happened to the real Naruto, Sasuke and the others that are not in the dream. This is very disappointing, this can literally drag the show from the start because it is pointless they can show every persons dream in 300 episode per person.
