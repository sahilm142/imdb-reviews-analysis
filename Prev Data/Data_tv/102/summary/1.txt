 Only likable for a small amount of people

 The office

 About as bad as it gets (Brit Review)

 Utterly uninspired and boring

 I'd rather eat my socks than watch a full season of this crap.

 Egad

 Vote 0... GOD awful!!!

 Political opinions shoved down your throat with mediocre comedy

 the very definition of mediocre

 The Goes Government

 bad!

 Disgusting.

 The Office without all that pesky comedy.
