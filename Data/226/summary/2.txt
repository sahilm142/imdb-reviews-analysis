 Schwarzenegger's my personal favorite best action classic masterpiece of all time

 The best of the best in its genre...

 This is the movie that made a big break through for sci-fi movies!!!!

 Nice night for a walk.

 Arnie is cool as the bad guy, in this classic 80's action film!

 One of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...

 The ultimate blend of Orwell and action

 The wonderful action movie which started a wonderful action saga

 It's about transformation

 The Terminator has heart. Cameron might be well advised,less is more.

 An excellent film, highly original

 Compelling science fiction

 One of Arnold's best

 Review of the Special Edition DVD

 Amazing, even for a non-fan of the genre

 The best of the best movies ever on the planet, galaxy & the entire universe

 The Terminator is one of the greatest films ever!

 As good as movies get.

 Bold, Gritty, and Realistic

 1984 and Beyond ...

 A true gem

 Greatest sci-fi/action movie ever?

 NO, The First One is Better

 The Obsession to Hunt

 Great Film
