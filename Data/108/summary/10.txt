 That's the way it crumbles...

 Becoming A Mensch

 A rare gem, this is a blessedly adult comedy with great performances, great writing and the kind of depth hardly ever seen in the more vapid, formulaic romantic comedies of today.

 WILDER'S GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT

 "I've Decided to Take My Doctor's Advice, I'm going to become a mensch."

 Likewise, it's a love-fest Lemmon-wise

 I work on the 19th floor. Ordinary Policy Department, Premium Accounting Division, Section W, desk number 861<U+0085>

 The definitive movie for the comedy/drama genre

 One Of the Finest Scripts Ever Written, and Jack Lemmon Creates One Of The Greatest Character Performances As The Wonderful C.C. Baxter

 ...and then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you were.
