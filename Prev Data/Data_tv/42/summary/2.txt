 If you remove the 80s nostalgia, not much there

 A paint by number exercise in nostalgia

 Netflix pushing on our nostalgia buttons - and getting away with it

 80s movies stolen and given bad diaologue/acting

 A real clunker

 Unoriginal, mediocre horror series, not sci-fi

 Fan Service x10

 season 2 total bs

 No need to watch it unless you are super bore

 i don't get it. why the hype?

 in 2nd season: slow 4 EPISODES. german series Dark lot better(eng subtitles)

 Stranger Things SJW propaganda!

 80s rip off

 Appears this is all we can expect from writers (and audiences) anymore.

 Goofs, Boring, Predictable

 Boring and uninteresting.

 Stranger crap

 Pretty Bad

 A sci-fi show for people want to say they like sci-fi but could never watch a sci-fi show.

 extremely overrated

 Cure for Imsomnia

 A Series By Children For Children

 so overrated

 Say what ?

 Boring. Why do people like this show??
