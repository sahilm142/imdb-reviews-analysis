 A fantastic dark first season

 Season 1=9, Season 2~3

 Season 1 top (10*s), Season 2 flop (3*s)

 It lost its way and got a little boring...

 Season 1 superb. Season 2 rubbish.

 Where is the big bad punisher?

 A great thriller with boring story arcs

 Good story and execution

 Skip Madani and BR scenes

 Unsurpassed

 Season 1 awesome. S2 not so much

 No MAGA hats? Marvel's silly anti-Christian Theme hurts otherwise good series 2

 Homeland : punisher. Non biased- fan review

 Season 2 is predictable

 Entertaining, but kinda disappointing as it does not make sense

 Season 1 = Entertaining, 2 = Tedious

 A Good Second Season

 Nothing Special So Far

 Fairly entertaining but for sporadic moments of pretentious sentimentality

 Episodes 1 to 9, incoherent, barely passable. Episodes 10 onwards, fantastic

 Really great violence but some plot/writing issues and a bit too predictable at times

 Suspenseful, Good, Enjoyable Series

 The conflict within marvel

 Basic Story, basic acting saved by a nice tandem with micro

 Pretty good, but not great
