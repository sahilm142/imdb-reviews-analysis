 Long and saccharine

 Overlong, Overblown and Over-rated

 Not

 Mystifyingly adored piece of melodrama

 The same old story

 Nothing special

 Not the best prison movie

 Crap

 It is ordinary movie only..

 No Redemption from Shawshank

 Overrated, absolutely not a classic.

 Get Busy Livin' or Get Busy Trying to Analyze This Film

 nothing special

 Brutal Anti-Bible Bigotry Prevails Again

 Ridiculously Overrated

 Subtlety, and the Lack Thereof

 Massively overrated

 Good

 very great

 nice

 Good movie

 Seriously, its not THAT good

 Overlength Weakens Promising Production

 Clichéd prison movie - why is this at number 2???
