 Survivor

 Intense biography about a Polish pianist named Szpilman during the Warsaw ghetto

 Film and Music, Pain and Fire

 Despite The Over Familiarity A Good Film

 "...10 minutes into the film, I was captivated."

 Good, but imdb voters are overrating it

 Beautiful

 Stupendous story told through an equally impressive film.

 Never again

 A Touch of Realism

 Le Pianiste" redirects here. For the 2001 French film originally titled La Pianiste

 good movie

 Hope against hope - a persistent, undiminishable light capable within (us)

 Important and fascinating piece of work that I was made for all the right reasons.

 A mirror to our own conscience

 Music is stronger than any weapon

 Amazing creation

 Pure awesomeness

 The Pianist is about young Jewish man who his talent for playing the piano led to an unexpected journey

 Very well acted but depressing.

 More than just a biography

 Absolutely heart-breaking

 Fulfilled all of my expectations

 Harrowing tale
