I found Deadwood to be a refreshing breeze compared to the long list of campy westerns that have been released in recent years. Granted, the language is harsh...sometimes overused, I feel...but that adds to the "realistic" feel of the show. The acting is superb, action real, drama intense. The woman that plays Calamity Jane definitely adds "a little something" to the show as well. A funnier, more "charming" character you would do good to find in any show or movie. The plots are good and hold your attention well, which is very important for sequel shows such as this one. Overall I give it a 8 out of 10. Short 2 of a full 10 simply because of language and complicated dialog.


                
This series was enjoyable, however, be sure the kids are sound asleep before watching! The series has so much profanity, it is as if it was written into the script strictly to see how much profanity could be written into a single script. Also, the nudity & sexuality that is seen seems to be dropped like a bomb out of nowhere sometimes simply for shock factor.That being said, the series is interesting & fun. The language is almost poetic, and it can be hard to follow, however, you catch the general gist of what is being said. Sometimes we had to pause & discuss what we thought was going on, because the language did cause some confusion. Also, the series is full of anachronisms (chronological inconsistencies), but you have to look for them to see them.You will want to keep Wikipedia up on your phone, or do a little research before watching. Wiki Calamity Jane, Wild Bill Hickok, Deadwood, & Al Swearingen...having a little history about these real people set in a mostly fictional story will increase your enjoyment of the series, especially when they toss in a few real facts or occurrences. All in all, the series is great, but you do need to be determined to watch it and prepared.


                
Deadwood. The writers of this show really know how to write a character. The show paints authentic people and has casted them even better. 
I have always known Ian McShane as an evil rotten actor and hence was fully prepared to hate him in this show. On completing the first season of this series, I am left thoroughly confused, as with the course of the season, my hatred towards him has surprisingly changed into slight admiration tinged with disgust. Not one character on this show is wholly good or bad, but instead are different shades between black and white. I find myself rooting for the baddies but still hoping justice is doled out. Timothy Olyphant is a delight to watch and so are the supporting cast. Brad Dourif especially stands out as Doc. The show is paced a bit slow but it doesnt disappoint, as every actor shines in their respective role. I cant wait to watch the second season to see the relationship between characters develop or rot. Anything can happen in Deadwood.


                
Such a great show. I wish it had continued. Interesting side note: It's fun counting all the different people that also had roles on SOA.


                
Very impressed with the first season. The overall story line was intriguing and kept me wanting more. The dialogue, although a little too foul, was well written with a Shakespearean touch to it. Don't know if people actually spoke that way back then, but it's fiction after all and meant to be entertainment.
I just started watching the second season and the very first thing I noticed is the dialogue's Shakespearean aspect increased dramatically and became much more distracting than entertaining. Season 2 drops from 8 to 6 stars in my opinion. Will continue to watch more episodes and see how it goes.


                
This is probably an accurate show about how it really was in the Wild West. A very rough world, it all feels very authentic. Everything is rough. Behaviour is rough, language is rough. Basically every sentence has some aggression and swearing. For some viewer this might be a bit offensive. The story is about life in the fast growing gold mining camp and emerging village Deadwood. It is a powerplay between some fantastic characters who want to set the rules and influence here. There are no good guys here, basically everyone has their own agenda to get what they want at almost any price. An outlaw country where the law is defined by who can pay and has control of the sheriff. Deadwood is unique in its portrayal of all this in a way that really makes you feel that "Hey this is probably as it really was" living in the Wild West. A pure hellhole in many respects by our standards. What drags it down is that the storyline and intrigue is not that complex and fascinating. You get a feeling that not much is really going on and progressing forward. With a more intelligent and subtle plot this series would have been a total homerun. Anyhow, very recommended to watch, not the least to get your historical knowledge how it really was during these no too far away times in the West.


                
Instead of Deadwood it should have been called Cock-sucker. 
This is the only criticism of a very realistic show that overdoes the cock-sucker word to a point where it becomes Dead Wood while grating your nerves.


                
As everyone else I immensely enjoyed this western drama set in the post-north/south-war-era. The acting was top notch. Especially Ian McShane. Powers Boothe is also at his very best. But most were a joy to watch. The biggest impression was still the characters' lines. Especially Mcshanes monologue lines. Poetry. And delivered as such. Shakespeareans should watch this series just for the dialogue. No kidding.The last episode of the last season before the series was cancelled left much to wish for though. There were a lot of inconsistencies in that one. Especially that the righteous kind of characters would so easily have swallowed the murder of an innocent just to cover up tracks. And that the "evil" character of McShane's who went through several stages from an all out evil to pretty decent made such a choice. Especially when his major motivation was that he didn't want to be told what to do.So unfortunately I understand why the series got cancelled. I would have chosen to replace the writers though instead of cancel it. Having such a stellar ensemble at hand is a rare thing. A series placed in an interesting time to boot.
Western have always been a popular stable of American culture, from pulp fiction stories, to films like The Searchers, the Man With No Name Trilogy, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Unforgiven and The Assassination of Jesse James. HBO has also produced some of the best television ever made, The Sopranos, Oz, Rome. Deadwood is a fine addition to that list.Set in the years 1876 to 1878, Deadwood is set in the town of Deadwood, South Dakota. Deadwood starts off as a small camp and slowly becomes a town through the course of the show. Deadwood is a growing town with gold prospers and becomes a area of interest for businesses, politicians and criminals. The show focuses on a number of characters, the town sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), his deputy Sol Star (John Hawkes), salon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) and prospector/mine owner Alma Garret (Molly Parker), as well as many key supporting characters throughout the series. The series focuses conflicts within the town. In the first series the main focus the conflict between Swearengen and Bullock over Garret's gold claim, one wants to protect her, the other wants to take it off her. The second is about Deadwood's attempt to become a part of South Deadwood and with outside interests wanting to take over people's gold claims from under them. The final series is about the conflict between Deadwood's citizens with the evil George Hearst (Gerald McRaney) who wants to take control of the town, using his thugs to gain it.The show is bold, focusing on themes about growth of law and order, the Untied States and Democracy in a small time. Deadwood and people change with the wider world. They are looks at industrialization process with minor themes about trade unionism, the growth of politics and the benefits and disadvantages of joining the union. The show also takes an new look of the west, it was not a glamorous world, but also looks at the influence of big business and not just individuals. The show looks at crime within the town, looking at drug dealing, prostitution, gambling and gang wars. This makes for interesting and entertaining viewing. This is a refreshing look at the west, almost like the Sopranos of the nineteenth century. There are subplots, from youth crime, to homosexuality to a very good one about a psychopathic serial killer. Deadwood is the closer America has come to making a costumer drama.The series has excellent characters and actors playing them. Swearengen is easily the best and Ian McShane made the role and Powers Boothe as his rival. There are good guest stars like Brain Cox who plays an over the top characters and Gerald McRaney as the quiet villain. I really like Garret Dillahunt as the villainous psycho. There are good supporting characters such as Mr. Wu, the leader of the Chinese and has some great comical moments with Swearengen and Joanne Stubbs, a prostitute who questions herself.The show is good for the most part but it is not perfect. The first is that in the show there are so many subplots that they end up unresolved and sometimes hard to follow. It takes away a compelling viewing. The second is the main character Bullock and the actor who plays him. The character is stiff and wooden compared to most of the other characters in the series and he is too righteous for his own good. He isn't interesting. Timothy Olyphant is a very wooden, a very dull actor. The character Alma also suffer from a similar problem, but Molly Parker is a pretty decent actress.


                
I don't usually like westerns or dramas but this was a good show. They were smart enough to not stretch it out for years and make people hate it. They ended it when it should have ended.


                
I finished it. Once in a while you see something and you immediately assume so much of it flew over your head... that's sort of how I feel with this. I enjoyed it a lot, don't get me wrong, but the only other show that I liked a hell of a lot while still feeling like a rewatch was definitely needed was The Wire (and that became my favorite show ever). The dialogue that this show has is pretty unique to it, and it's part of what makes it frustrating but also endlessly fascinating. Before I started it I assumed it was going to be a pretty thrilling, tense, plot- driven show (something like Breaking Bad) but what I got was so different. A show that I deeply admire, if maybe not always love. The characters, though, are pretty unforgettable (except maybe Bullock, who really faded into the background for good reason after the first season it seemed)


                
This western is definitely well written apart from one major off-putting factor where they've gone over board with the venomous language! Admittedly in those hard day's the language would have been bad but the writers have overstretched in this case. Timothy Olyphant has a unique way of speaking volumes with his eyes, maybe one of the superb abilities he has as a great actor and provider of true escapism! Keeping an aspect of romance amid all the muck and filthy hardship those pioneers endured is an important aspect of any good western or any other genre. Ian Mcshane does a great job as the hard done by survivor who has no moral compass whatsoever. This show has the entire combination of any good show-namely..... the irritating , annoying, kind and upright moralistic, the honourable and the poor downtrodden characters thAt play with our emotion like a violin!


                
I wish that the writers would not feel the need to lace the dialog with endless F - bombs. People did not talk like that in the 1800's. The actors are good. Timothy Olyphant is great.


                
Deadwood is an amazing show. The only knock I could have against it is that you have to be really careful who you let watch it because it is not for family/children viewing at all. There is more swearing than I think in any other show I have ever seen, also there is nudity, sex, etc. Of course there is violence as well. The performances in this show are amazing whoever did the casting for this show hit the nail on the head with every single character they cast for. The actors are all totally believable in every role on this show. The writing is also very good it is simply a great show that mature audiences will probably really enjoy as long as they don't mind all the swearing etc. Not for everyone but great for those who can stomach the violence, swearing and so forth.
