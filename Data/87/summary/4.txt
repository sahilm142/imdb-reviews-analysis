 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Review.

 Average and slightly trashy 'pop art' fest that feels shallow but 'nice'.

 What a mess!

 Hmmm...I usually like these films, but not this one.

 One silly little idea, done to death

 Gay And Oh-So-Quirky With Not Much Substance

 just couldn't make myself care

 don't watch it just 'coz it has great rating........!!!

 Pretentious, overrated bore

 Eternally Confusing and Disappointing

 Eternal damnation of a plot less movie

 I liked this film for about the first 20 minutes,

 You Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone

 OK movie, but.... its overrated

 This movie should be placed eternally in a spot where the sun don't shine

 Great Formula!

 Dismal

 Confusing and lacking comedic value

 A Most Disappointing and Shallow Screenplay!

 Cometh the emperor...

 Obvious plot, no love, hugely overrated

 not so hot
