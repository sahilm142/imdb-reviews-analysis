 So excellent, that I couldn't recommend it more!

 Great Movie

 Make a Favour to Yourself and See This Wonderful Animated Feature!

 It's a genuine celebration of the value of difference.

 Angry, Dense, Unforgettable

 An animated life

 The Marvelous Mary and Max

 Bittersweet animated story masterfully executed

 Moving story of two misfits is one of the best films of 2009

 My favorite animation film up to now

 wow... wow ....and a wow ....!

 Unforgettable

 Based on a trues story? Hmm....

 its all about feelings..

 When i sobbed like a baby

 Charming, sublime, unique, moving, hilarious.

 After seeing his previous films, I just had to watch this one...

 An Unexpected Masterpiece

 An astonishing work of art

 So many letters to define Mary and Max, and not enough words to describe them...

 Mary and Max - A tale of friendship

 Realistic, funny and strangely creative

 The obscurity of love, life and death, all can be felt in this film!
