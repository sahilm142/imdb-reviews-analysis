This movie, Stand By Me, is a retelling of a novella by my favorite author, Steven King, an one of my favorite stories ever. So, anxiously, I picked up this movie and...Hated it. Oh, I've seen bad movies before, and this was not the worst, but it wasn't a movie I'd come back to. After seeing The Shawshank Redemption, another King novella in the same book, I expected more great things. Alas...I'd like to finsih this by saying that the acting was not bad, but it is mostly just the director' uncanny ability to draw out the best. So, I must give this a 4 out of a possible 10, and pray that people who liked this see Shawshank Redemption and THEN watch it. See the difference!
