 Preachy, Simplistic, and Sappy

 The Ultimate Fad Movie

 Assault on intellectuals everywhere.

 An argument for not making movies out of books

 Reelin' in the years..."Being There"

 Over-hyped feel-good fodder

 Tediously slow and overall pointless

 pointless movie

 Only In America

 Overpaid, over-rated and over here!

 Sugar-coating around a poison pill

 Overrated melodrama

 Suffers from directorial influence

 I just don't get it

 FACT: mental handicap = nomination

 This one ain't going to age well...

 Whole is Much Less than Sum of Parts

 A Forrest of complete Gump

 I liked the script because it was a movie different

 Minor plot completely runs out of steam by midway

 Stodgy and Over Rated

 Rather overrated

 Life does have lessons, But....

 great movie

 serendipitous advice
