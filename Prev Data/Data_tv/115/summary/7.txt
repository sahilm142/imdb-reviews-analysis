 Matt Weiner, you are no David Chase, you are no Alan Ball

 Smugfest - more about the makers than the sixties subjects

 Big time let down

 Mad men season 7

 Very good show that steadfastly misses the mark

 Good Show, Not Great

 Smoke gets in your eyes!!

 Funny how the member reviews have progressed over time

 How this show effects us now. And a little analysis as well.

 We binged watch all seven (7) seasons and all the hype was unwarranted

 Mad for Mad Men

 Mad men and made women

 I binge watched the entire series

 Mad Men 5. It is what it is.
