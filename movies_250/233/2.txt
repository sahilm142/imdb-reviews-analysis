I enjoyed this film when I first saw it as a child. Bill Murray is great, and the idea of being stuck in the same day is a fun premise.And then I saw it again recently. And again. And I actually started pondering what was going on in the film.And you know what? It's a delightful film, but it is also rubbish in terms of philosophy.Apparently Bill Murray has to spend an eternity bettering himself so he can deserve Andie MacDowell. But what does she have to do? Apparently nothing. Let me tell you something: If Murray became such a wonderful human being, he would have no interest in that selfish, self- obsessed, insipid tart. I mean, look at that woman: She imagines to be a morally superior princess that no one deserves. That is how she justifies the fact that she is still single. She proceeds to toast to 'world peace' and imagine to be a mother to a bunch of children, but in reality she'd probably divorce the poor bastard she married before they could even have a child. This is one cold woman and it doesn't even take a single day of self-improvement to figure that out.So not only is this film illogical, it is misandric.I give it two stars: one for Bill Murray and one for the hog.
