 Not a masterpiece

 A fall from grace...

 Beautiful but vastly overrated

 So...where is the masterpiece I've heard so much about?

 Misses Me..

 No towering achievement

 The biggest mystery is how did this film become so highly rated?

 What Happened Hitch ?

 Real classics do not need the label 'Classic'

 Just another overrated old movie

 Terrible, terrible, terrible

 Thrilling but not Thrilled

 too bad

 Not one of Hitchcock's best, despite its "rediscovery" in recent years

 One of the Master's weaker efforts

 More plot holes than a collander

 To Much Romance for Me
