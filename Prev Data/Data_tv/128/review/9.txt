Beautiful, emotional, insightful, and evocative, the second season, has really refined and expanded on this theme and the emotionalism of the first season. The locations and their unexpected beauty, provide a beautiful, palate cleansing counterpoint, to what, in the hands of a lesser producer and director, could descend into a foodie travelogue. Not here. History, culture, and family, are at the heart of this series and heart is the operative word here I highly recommend this to any and all who want another look at our De facto global language, food.Note: one critique I have here, is the stark and noticeable absence of African, African-American, and Middle Eastern chefs. This is something that the chefs interviews themselves reveal as a shortcoming, (in their own words), our commercialized (American and European) culinary biases, about what is delicious, or finely crafted. I find the said absence of African, African-American, and middle Eastern chefs, strange, since the entire internationalist narrative of this series, is so advanced and inclusive. Season three: I'm counting on you! Bring Africa, Black America, and the Middle east to the chef's table! I Implore you!Piero Amadeo Infante
