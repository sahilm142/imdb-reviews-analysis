 A Pale Excuse for a TV Show

 The Worst TV Has to Offer

 Must-Miss-TV - Bad Directing Kills Friday Night Lights Dead

 It tried to be the movie, and fails

 Makes you want to never watch NBC again!!

 Nothing but a soap opera in a jockstrap

 Why is this Bad, Low-Rated Still on the Air

 MSCL vs FNL ...it's really no contest.

 Unwatchable, Badly Made

 In a Word : Hideous

 One of the Worst Shows

 Terrible. Deserves Immediate Cancellation
