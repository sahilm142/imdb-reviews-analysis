 Fire your costume designer

 Great first 4 seasons but it seems to be getting slower and slower.

 the best new series of the 2012-13 season

 Russian Leg Sweep.

 Solid Final Season

 Masterpiece!

 A long fourth season with plenty of twists! A slow setup fifth season

 At times good. At times silly. Overall, disappointing.

 Fun to watch but very unrealistic and moving too fast

 Is This the Most Deadpan Situation Comedy Ever Made?

 Good enough to keep watching for a while at least

 that shows how ridiculous communists \ far leftists are

 Far too bloody and one-sided political drama. Still, not bad.

 If You Can Suspend Reality...it's good!
