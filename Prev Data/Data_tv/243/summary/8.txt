 Intriguing Intrigues

 To Ponzi or Not to Ponzi

 Billions is an intriguing new show that has promise. Second season is even better

 Corporate version of House of Cards on steroids

 SEASON 3

 Amazing

 I really hate these types

 Season 3 writing is excellent

 2008 AIG fiasco

 A televised graphic novel

 ..from E1 to E6... a full 180.. and even better at the end..

 Overall good but too much colored language

 Great show

 Promising and relevant

 Great Series

 Billions delivers

 Very entertaining show, but...
