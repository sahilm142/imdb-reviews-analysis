 I've seen this movie 3 times, and I still don't 'get' it.

 A confused mess from people who should've known better.

 One of the Most Overrated Films of All Time

 Mixed bag of awkward

 Why is this movie rated the 16th best of all time?

 3rd funniest of all time?

 Forget it.

 Doesn't Live Up To The Hype

 Don't waste your time on this dated and unfunny film....
