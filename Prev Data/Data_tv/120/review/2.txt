Don't watch this, not because it is racist (it isn't, although the characters are stupidly drawn national stereotypes), but because it is so unbelievably bad.Here is an example of a "joke".Teacher (taking register): "Juan" Juan: "Present"Teacher: "Ingrid".Ingird: "Present".Teacher: "Rita".Rita: "Present".Teacher: "Rajeet".Rajeet: "Gift".Teacher: "Pardon".Rajeet: "Gift means the same as present". (Huge burst of canned laughter, there may as well have been a cymbal clash)It didn't get any better than this. Please remember, the 1970s wasn't all Fawlty Towers and Porridge. There were plenty of feeble shows like this too.
