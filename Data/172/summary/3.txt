 Just watch the original "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" instead.

 Dull Thriller Offers Nothing New

 A movie on ADHD

 Not very good at all

 Predictable

 Absolutely dreadful. A complete waste of time.

 "The Twilight Zone" meets "...Cuckoos Nest." Sheesh...

 Blip Time: Part 6

 This movie has one huge problem

 This movie was soooooo bad and predictable

 Too unsubtle in its drama

 Shutter in the Aisle

 Overused storyline, overblown execution

 Please, just one more flashback/dream sequence

 What a let down

 A film that lost its way..

 Another mediocre Scorsese effort.

 Disappointing Movie

 More boring than horrifying

 Scorsese at his worst

 your times are up

 Technically brilliant, but ultimately predictable and heartless.

 Losing the plot

 Eh?

 So very disappointing
