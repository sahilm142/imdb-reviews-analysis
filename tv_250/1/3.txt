What's up with the slow motion? Animals do not move in slow motion in nature.What's up with the audio effects? As far as I can remember, in real life, when there is a violent conflict between two beings, there are no slamming sounds, no biting sounds, etc.The only thing missing on this show is that they should now add reality-TV-like production cuts to this series. Then, I am sure, the show will win awards.Seriously....
