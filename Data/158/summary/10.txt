 Understated Perfection

 The Greatest War Comedy ?

 Richly inventive comedy with a logically impeccable plot that makes the hyperbolic slapstick seem plausible and inevitable; this is a work of art and a work of genius

 Wonderful Humor, Action, & Melodrama

 An instant favorite

 Keaton shows why he was king of comedy stunts
