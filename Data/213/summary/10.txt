 Logan is everything you wanted it to be and more

 Brutally violent, emotional, and character-driven, "Logan" is the Wolverine film fans have been waiting for

 If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.

 Just A Flat Out MASTERPIECE!

 Best X-Men Movie so far

 The Best Wolverine Movie, Hands Down!

 What Happens When Superheros Get Old.

 Here's to 17 Years

 A masterfully orchestrated film

 A character-driven superhero film done right!

 so much more than i expected

 The Last Cut Is The Deepest!

 Hands down the best superhero movie

 Wow

 A Fitting But Painful End

 One of the best films I've seen

 This film combines both a love for comic books and a love for good movies

 More realistic X-Men episode works better

 Sad is a serious understatement

 Logan is the best superhero film since The Dark Knight

 A movie about Logan, not Wolverine

 "So, this is what it feels like"

 Uncanny!

 Finally - Wolverine arrives

 don't get it
