 Rwanda's Schindler

 Pretty good movie, pretty pretentious comments

 Good Film With a Strong Story

 10/10 from its message 6/10 for the movie itself... a bit over-hyped.

 Excellent except for one thing

 Grand Hotel

 Informative Movie

 Interesting subject, but laid on way too thick

 Over rated

 A bit overrated but worth the time to see at least once

 Not terrible, but certainly not great.

 An important film.

 Hotel Rwanda's cinematic compression of history

 Rusesabagina's List

 A good movie, yet ....

 "Hotel Rwanda" is an historical drama.

 Pattern is a little small

 There is always room.

 Some true stories like most never make it on the screens. Fortunately for Paul Rusesabagina's (played by Don Cheadle) story it does make to become one of the best movies ever.

 An incredible story of bravery within one of the most barbaric episodes in recent history

 Shameful and compelling.

 Whoever Saves One Life, Saves the World Entire.

 Hotel Rwanda

 I'm Not A Movie Basher But This Movie Was Overrated
