 Eh, excuse me !!

 Clever contrived plot but ultimately shallow

 Lock Stock and 2 hours of rubbish

 Modern "fun", I presume

 wow, the stereotypes

 Probably the least enjoyable movie experience of my life...

 Bad.

 Lame attempt to make an MTV/Witty Mob film

 Pointless.

 VERY POOR

 Overrated, slow, a waste of time

 Dire, swearing and no plot

 One of the worst movies I've seen.

 Well it's British... but so was Charlie Chaplin

 Remember that story about the Emporers new clothes?..

 Quite possibly the worst film ever made

 You're all wrong - it's terrible!

 Seriously awful
