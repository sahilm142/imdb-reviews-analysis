 Boring, too long, illogical, awful dialogue

 Ridiculous and extravagant, with little sense

 Chaotic and pretentious

 Sort of like a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s

 Highly overrated - believe me

 All The Classic Marks Of A Bad Movie<U+0085>

 Just when I thought I was stuck in a dream(nightmare), I find some realistic reviews of this tosh!

 Expensive drivel

 Perception

 Inception: A Smart Movie For Ignorant People

 Terribly overrated.

 The Reality Is That A Dream Is Reality While You're Dreaming It

 If this is brilliance, then we are so screwed!

 Think I've failed my A-Level Filmgoing

 A 4 Masquarading as a 10

 I wish I'd been dreaming instead of watching this

 Sign of the times

 Almost a waste of time

 Nolan Should Leave Sci-Fi Films To The Experts.

 A hardcore action movie in disguise

 A big disappointment

 What went wrong? Nolan was rather promising 10 years ago.

 Easily one of the biggest rip-offs I have ever seen.

 What kind of an accomplishment is it to be a born liar ?

 Great cast very hard to follow the point of this movie
