 Terrific Pilot Episode . . . and then the plane crashed. Sad.

 This is not even a work in progress

 Really?

 Sick, depressive and full of clichés...

 Biggest disappointment ever

 Pathetic...

 Plot just keeps getting worst

 Season 2 is pretty awful

 From really good to the worst possible!

 not great and getting much worse

 Great pilot, then went from mediocre to bad to awful to terrible

 Ripped off fight club,,,, American psycho and a lot of other awesome movies and series

 Disappointed

 One of the worse things I've ever seen

 Pretentious dialogues and philosophy, fight club wannabe with boring twist

 Pretentious Drivel

 Review for season 2

 Some decent acting, preposterous and cliché writing

 Awful, seriously. NOT WORTH A WATCH

 Don't waste your time. Seriously.

 IMDb ratings are fake

 cheap..

 Am I the only one out there that thinks this is...........
