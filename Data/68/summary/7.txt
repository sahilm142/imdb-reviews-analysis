 Delivers a beautiful, lasting message

 Thinly-conceived, but arrogantly brilliant...

 Drama Americana

 A masterpiece. A shocking look at personal collapse.

 A Rose By Any Other Name

 American Pulchritude

 squirrel-cute Mena Suvari

 Pretty Good Movie

 Simple yet so complicated

 Kevin Spacey brings humor to a self-obsessed world

 Not a masterpiece but..

 enjoyable but not spectacular

 It isn't like fooling a American audience would be that hard

 Family film for grown ups

 Such a Contrast

 overly praised film saturated with symbolism

 Didn't live up to the hype

 Why this film is a home run (and "The Ice Storm" wasn't)

 Pretty Good, but not Great

 Hard to lose interest.

 A sweet movie about a sweet man

 Acting and Directing? 10. Screenplay? 5.

 It's good, but not the best....

 Appropriate tag line?

 Loved it - until the End
