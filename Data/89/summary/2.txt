 Conspiracy!

 I wanted to like it

 By Using Two Extremes, Kubrick Fails to State Anything About Humanity

 Yet another overrated Kubrick film...

 Don't Bother

 What the heck was that?!

 Worst Novel-to-Film Adaptation I've ever seen

 Does not do the story justice.

 That Chaplain sticks in my throat

 Stupid.

 Injustice

 over-rated and average

 Good versus Evil

 Not good , and hasn't aged well either .

 An Embarrassment

 Poor acting, dialogue, music and camera work, wasted 136min of my life -.-

 Stop worshiping this film and open your eyes.

 Why, oh, why...

 After a number of attempts I finally gave up on this film

 Overly Violent Mindless Stupid Movie

 So boring!
