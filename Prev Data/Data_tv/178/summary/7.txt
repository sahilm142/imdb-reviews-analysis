 Season one 8.5/10 ; Season two 7/10

 Loved the first season, but kind of hated the second

 Very good but too slow

 Crackpot idea saved by execution

 Season 1 better than season 2

 Disturbing dystopia but a quality new original on Hulu

 Very good series but everything is too slow

 Amazing and Thrilling Trailer

 Is this a warning?

 season 1: 10/10 .season 2: 5/10

 A modern take on an old story. And the old and modern doesn't mix well

 Lost it's luster after the 2nd season

 Too much philosophising

 Very interesting except one problem...

 Great big HOLE!

 Wonderful to start with but maybe the profit motive has taken over....

 What's up with this crazy cult?

 Season two is a mistake

 As a guy, I thought it Was good, expected a crazy Turn around ending(Good finally gets revenge).. didn't.

 Interesting but drawn out
