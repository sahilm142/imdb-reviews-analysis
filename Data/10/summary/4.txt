 Too good to be bad , but it is

 Very, Very Ordinary

 I don't think so

 Highly Overrated!!!

 All Pretension, No Punch

 Over-rated

 And here I wondered why the rental wasn't rewound ...

 Preposterous and Imbecilic

 Half baked

 i didn't manage to emphatize or suspend my disbelief on this flawed movie

 Over Rated

 Clearly I'm not in the target audience

 Stupefying beyond belief; Fight Club is a messy spectacle of ugliness, exposition and crass ideologies playing out under a broad banner of mainstream entertainment.

 David Fincher has done it again (badly)

 Most Folks Utterly Miss The Point (spoilers)

 What's wrong?

 A Cult Film, lacking universal appeal....

 doesn't justify the ending

 If you think

 Technically fascinating, but muddled message-wise

 Like watching the wet dream of a fascist...

 Hardly even entertaining, and a poor attempt at punk imitation.

 Style and attitude do not a story make

 Releasing Frustrations

 Psychosis and brain-damaged anarchy
