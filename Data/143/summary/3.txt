 Don't believe the hype

 Dry action-comedy with almost incomprehensible dialogue

 Irritating and witless

 Flash in the pan, so cool it hurts turkey.

 What moron told Guy Ritchie he had any talent?

 highly over-rated

 One long music video

 Overhyped confusing movie

 Worth 8.1 stars? Not on your Nelly.
