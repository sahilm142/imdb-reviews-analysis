 Not just for anime lovers. This truly is a fantastic series.

 Not as bad as it seems at first glance!

 Easily one of the best shows ever made

 Nickelodeon's Swang-Song. Comparable to Batman: The Animated Series.

 One of the best animated shows I seen

 A well-done cartoon that appeals to both children and adults.

 I can believe it gets better!!!

 I'll be damned if it isn't worth the praise - a must-see

 Avatar Returns...

 Perhaps the Greatest TV Series of All-Time

 Simply the best..!!

 Nick's saving grace. Too bad it's over.

 Anime in all but origin - GREAT series!

 God you're cute...too bad you're made out of meat(Sokka)

 Great Show

 Wonderful Story Telling for All Ages

 Excellent show

 It's great, but Katara is a ----- lol...

 They don't make them like they used to... but neither did they ever make them like this before

 Great show- not like most Nickelodeon nonsense.

 One of my Favorite Animated Shows
