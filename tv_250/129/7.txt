"Father Ted" is the kind of show that's funnier when you're drinking. It's not particularly witty or even well-written -- it's more about sight-gags and potty-humor. The cast is great, especially Ardal O'Hanlon, but they don't have much to work with. The laugh-track gets pretty annoying as well. I know the loyalists will vote against my review, but an objective viewer will admit that this is far from a perfect series. This is FAR from Monty Python and not nearly as thoughtful as VoD. Good for a few laughs, especially over a Guinness, but the forced laugh-track says much. I'm not sure why they are even considering an American version -- these shows rarely work outside their original context.
