This show is so BAD!The acting is bad, the comedic timing is off, the jokes are unfunny!The lead looks so anaemic it makes me gag. Or maybe he should gag; on some steak.I still like to watch it when I've run out of shows, just cos I want to see where the show goes. And Peter Gregory is pretty funny. Otherwise, the only ones worth watching are TJ Miller, Kumail Nanjiani and Martin Starr. I liked Martin better in Party Down, and Kumail is always funny (Portlandia, Tubbin with Tash).Ya, this show sucks. But good effort anyway!
