 Please no fighting in the war room

 The most powerful men hiding under a table, hoping for the best

 " Mr. President , . . We Must Not Allow a Mine-Shaft Gap!!! "

 Funniest movie of all time

 The irrationality of cold war rationality

 Peace sells... but none's buying

 A must watch satire

 It might be a little dated, but Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is still da bomb. A fun watch.

 I Don't Completely Get It!

 A dark comic masterpiece

 Brilliant

 Glorious madness...

 Great film!

 Humor Makes The Pill Go Down

 Black comedy at its Zenith...

 Smart satire on "mutual assured destruction" for a sophisticated spectator

 this is the war room..

 The enduring genius of "Strangelove" is its hilariousness combined with deeply real satire

 Sheer Genius

 Worth Watching, Again and Again

 Going Toe to Toe with the 'Rooskies'

 A work of comedic genius.

 Incredibly Funny and Thought Provoking

 Comedy Masterpiece by Master Kubrick

 I'm just as sorry as you are Dmitri ...
