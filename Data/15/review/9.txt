Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is "brooding". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for "epic battle sequences" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers).


                
I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far).


                
The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.


                
Don`t you just hate cinemas ? No matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . If we`re after a running commentary we`ll buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this I`m a chainsmoker and cinema chains don`t allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I don`t visit cinemas . But it`s a rule I broke in order to see THE TWO TOWERS because I was literally dying to see it . So I booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in Rothesay on the 26th of January , popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained****** SPOILERS ******I was entertained and more , but I later had some reservations . On a technical level TTT not only does not disappoint but it outdoes FELLOWSHIP in terms of both scope and scale but this doesn`t automatically make it as some people have claimed a better film . The battles of Helms Deep and Isengard are truly breath taking and out do anything Hollywood has done , but ironically by concentrating on spectacle TTT feels more like a Hollywood film than FELLOWSHIP . And all this spectacle causes a problem for Peter Jackson - How does he finish all these impossibly epic set pieces ? The simple answer is he can`t ! As several reviewers have mentioned the fractured storyline comes to the rescue of the director in much the same way as Gandalf rides to the rescue of Helms Deep : Cut to the most breath taking calvary charge in the history of cinema , cut to the Ents attacking Isengard and then cut back to Helms Deep where our heroes have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat  , except they did so mainly off screen . It`s as if the director has used the fractured storyline in order to get himself out of a corner . Likewise reviewers on this site have noticed the story telling technique hides several plot holes involving characters appearing and disappearing to and from the story .Of course you don`t notice these flaws at the time due to the awesome onscreen visuals but there is one major criticism you can level at TTT as soon as the credits roll and that`s a lack of an emotional impact . Yes you`ll gasp and cheer and feel your heart race but you won`t burst into tears . Remember the scenes in the first film where the fellowship escape into the mountains after Gandalf has confronted the Balrog or the departure of Boromir ? Remember how your throat tightened and you nearly had a tear run down your face ? Of course you do because these two scenes are amongst the most moving and heart wrenching in cinema history . Unfortunately there is no similar equivalent in TTT . And the film also cries out for a flawed but noble ambigous anti hero like Boromir in a story where everyone is either good or evil and no in between , though this is almost certainly the fault of Tolkien rather than Jackson who does manage to get the best out of his cast in film lacking in character development . Special mention goes to Andy Serkis who alas seems to have missed out on nominations for best supporting actor , Brad Dourif who plays a very slimy villain , and Bernard Hill who made me forget that this is the same actor who played Yosser Hughes in BOYS FROM THE BLACKSTUFF 20 years ago . But I couldn`t help but miss Sean Bean and I suppose casting him as Faramir twin brother of Boromir would have been just too obviousBut despite my criticisms I enjoyed TTT immensely and for three magical hours I forgot all about my nicotine addiction and the world outside . No doubt the audience at the Rothesay cinema felt the same way as me as we watched this film in a hushed silence . We laughed at the right bits , gasped at the technical achievements , but no one cried which means I can only award THE TWO TOWERS 9 out of 10
I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time. The key was how I looked at the key character of this film: "Gollum" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of the film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was.Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?


                
Along with The Godfather Part 2 and The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers is the perfect middle chapter. While not a perfect film, as a movie with no concrete beginning or ending, it tells a masterful story and keeps the audience wanting more. Some characters are severally underdeveloped (mostly new ones) and it's a bit slow at times. But besides these more major complaints, the film is a masterpiece. As with the last film, the acting is great, the effects are groundbreaking (Gollum changed CGI), and the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting. The dialogue works really well to. The movie is simply filled with iconic moments.Some complain about the battle of Helms Deep being to long but let's be honest, it is really one of the best battle scenes in cinematic history. I believe that the Lord of the Rings trilogy are the greatest films of this century. The Two Towers is a grand adventure, epic war movie, compelling drama and overall, an amazing movie.


                
Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better.


                
Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got "ambiguity" and "unreliability" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his "preccciousssss" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002.


                
Took me a LONG time to see this film. Anything that EVERYONE liked, I was sure I wouldn't. But, when I finally got around to watching it I was shocked. It was a lovely film and was much more moving than I expected. The effects were great but never distracting as many films are. And the story was faithful. The stars were all perfectly cast and it wsa beautifully adapted. If MGM and the old studios were still making great costume epics today they would have been proud to have made this one!


                
First off, The Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  As with the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers is one of the best films ever.  However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short.  Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players.  We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures.  Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's  more intimate look at the characters.  This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  WETA Digital truly deserves all of the kudos that have been bestowed upon them.  They have supplanted Industrial Light and Magic as the preeminent digital effects company.Bottom Line:10/10!!!


                
9 out of 10  (Like its predecesor, LOTRTT gets a little windy in places)Discounting the StarWars trilogy (forever tarnished by the crap that Lucas is making now), this film is the BEST 2nd installment of a trilogy I have ever seen. It really makes me believe that filming all 3 at once was indeed the only way to do this trilogy.Jackson takes some liberties, but all in all the film is a success on several levels. Characters are maintained and strengthened, The plotting does well not to be too dreadful without inserting lightheartedness or breathtaking action, and the special effects absolutely blew me out of the water.To all the Star Wars fans out there, take a look at Gollum, and see Yoda could only hope to be.  Gollum is so life like and well portrayed.All in all a great movie, albiet with some minor flaws,...  very minor.


                
Thank You Peter Jackson.  These films are absolutely magical.  The Two Towers has flaws, but is still a great experience of a movie.  I looked at some of those who post to slam this film.  One said that when he buys the movie he would use scene selection to skip over the parts he didn't like.  I suppose the irony was lost on that one.  I also saw a lengthy slam where the poster stated that on the two viewings he had of the film people were laughing at golem.  I love this film, but I have only seen it once.
So do you see...  this is a great movie.  Even those who hate it can't look away.  Even though it betrays their personal take on the books, there is magic on the screen that keeps them coming.I will buy the DVD promptly Aug 26th.


                
The epic saga of Middle Earth continues in this very good sequel to Fellowship. In fact, I think it's the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed it even more because I knew a bit more about the characters and the story. I must admit that I haven't read the books. The special effects are once again great and the battle scenes are spectacular. I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.Out of 100, I gave it 88. That's good for ***½ out of ****.Seen in Toronto, at the Famous Players Paramount Cinemas, on January 19th, 2003.


                
Peter Jackson has done it again, with the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, "The Two Towers". An excellent film, but it is my least favourite in the trilogy.Sam and Frodo continue their journey towards Mordor to rid Middle Earth of the One Ring, while Aragon, Gimli and Legolas prepare to do battle with the armies of the dark. Also, we get to see Gollum for the first time in this film, in all of his CG glory! Pure screen magic. Amazing special effects, a great storyline continuing the tale, this is a film that should definitely not be missed! The end battle is pure CG magic! Peter Jackson has done it once again! I recommend the extended edition, which shows us more in this wonderful tale.I say that this is my least favourite in the trilogy for the simple reason that it jumps from Sam and Frodo, to Aragon and Legolas, to Merry and Pippen, and back and forth. It can get somewhat confusing and hard to follow if you have not read the books.Despite this one minor flaw, the film is eye-poppingly beautiful, from the beautiful scenes, to the amazing special effects. Definitely not a film to be missed!


                
This is the war. This is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. Because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. Once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. Still they are considered to be separate. The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do. It will live forever in film history.


                
This was too an excellent part though a little short that the 1st part. This shows the dark forces gathering while the good are attempting to defeat the army of Saruman in their own ways all realizing that it's not in their individual capacity to do so. The crucial task of the Ent army added colours and adventure to the story. The return of Gandalf as the White Witch was interesting (none could be thought without him). The differing roles of the four hobbits and cunning games played by Gollum are worthy of mentioning. 
Also the entry of Gandalf at the crucial moment in the war of Helm's deep and the Ent destroying the setup of Saruman and Sauron are main events of the movie. Overall this ends on the disturbed sides wherein all the forces are not united while the Orcs are preparing for the big war.
After watching The Fellowship of the Ring I was curious to see what else was in store for the companions of the Shire and their friends and allies. This outdid the first one. Lots of action and more beautiful vistas and sights plus that epic battle sequence at one point in the film (you'll see!). It reminds me so much of those medieval battles in the Middle Ages but ten times bigger. Plus we see some new faces in the course of the story. If you enjoyed the first Lord of the Rings film, don't wait! See this followup!


                
Although the expedition was in parts, the march was not over. Kind Frodo accepted bad Gollum without hearing the opinion of Sam. In fact without Sam, the task could not be finished. From the ending part of the first film, we could see Sam was realizing his promise.The ring began torturing Frodo. His flesh and soul suffered double strike. But he still persisted in it. That was the hardest moment for Frodo in the journey. Insisting is just the victory. So does it in reality.Although Saruman and Sauron were defeated, the dark lord Sauron still had the ability to reorganize the dark army and attack the mankind again. The peace for Middle-earth had not come yet.The hardship in the journey deepened the friendship between Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin. They endured the test, though the victory had not come yet. A friend in need is a friend indeed.As the second film of TLOTR trilogy, it is necessary and satisfying. 9/10
Oh man, where's a thesaurus when you need one!If you hadn't noticed, I absolutely LOVED this movie! Violence, greed, power, lust, corruption, betrayal ... it has all the makings of a biography of a congressional lobbyist, but without the glitter.The first movie was a bit "too busy" for my taste. I prefer to inhale every now and then. This movie seemed better balanced and even during the enormous fight scenes, there was enough pause to blink. The bad guys seemed somehow more real in this version also. Maybe because you got to hear some of them talk now and then. Seeing the monsters bickering about not having enough fresh food to eat and whining about doing a five day forced march also made them (dare I say) .. more human.Anyway, I can't wait for the final chapter.  I don't think I could survive the 9-hour marathon viewing of all three chapters (my friends are all ready for it), but I certainly will be in line for the first opening in my area for the final chapter. If it's half as good as Two Towers, I won't be disappointed.Gee ... I guess I should go read the books now!


                
This franchise will, in all likelihood, become remembered as a franchise that shaped filmmaking over the next 10-20 years, and will remain a watched film while the industry lasts. The question then commonly asked becomes, "Does this movie deserve to be remembered that long?"The answer to that question is, really "deserved" is the wrong word.Independence Day will probably still be watched 30 years from now, not because it is necessarily all that good, but because it was hugely successful and spawned a slew of disaster-related flicks. In other words, it defined an era. And with the Harry Potter series being developed as we speak, and both the Chronicles of Narnia and His Dark Materials being made into franchises, one can easily conclude that this film will be remembered as the film that spawned the development of modern fantasy blockbusters (although the Harry Potter series being contemporary was coincidental). By now, we have come to expect that lesser films will occasionally become classics, while greater films will occasionally fall into obscurity.However, I feel, and I hope you will concurr when you see it for yourself, that this is a worthy addition to those era-defining films that come along every-so-often. In fact, IMHO, this is one of the best era-defining films since Star Wars, or at least one of the most enjoyable. Several things from this franchise are truly, justifiably, memorable, such as the wholesome innocence of the Shire and the hobbits, gandalf's stand against the balrog, the preparation for the climactic battle of helms deep, the double personality of Gollum, and...well, since this review is being written in August of 2002 and the Return of the King is not out yet, I'll leave this last one blank, but I am confident that this last film will give us something that will make it worth remembering, perhaps even more than the first two. Some say that the oscar should and will go to this last film, but I say that the oscar has had mixed reactions to these era-defining franchises (the only film I would classify as an era-defining franchise that garnered an oscar since the 70s was Silence of the Lambs), and the Academy might be better off bestowing the award on another film that will fall into obscurity if not honored, rather than adding garnish to an already classic series.I never garauntee that everyone will like a film. If you go to the Casablanca (my personal all-time favorite) page on this website and check the rating stats, you'll find that more than a few people have given it a "1" rating. But most probably will find this film at least a highly enjoyable diversion, and that is what film is all about in the first place.9/10


                
I think I may be the only person I know who still prefers "The Fellowship of the Ring" to "The Two Towers".  That doesn't take much away from this film, it's just that truly perfect films are rare, and it's hard to make lightning strike twice.I have only three real problems with this film.  The first is Gandalf.  In the first film, Gandalf the Grey was a kindly, grandfatherly figure.  In this one, Gandalf the White is cold and strangely distant (admittedly, this is a problem with the original source material, so I guess that Jackson was just being true to the book).  Also, in the first film, Ian McKellen's prosthetics looked like real hair and a real beard.  In this one, they look like the stage props they are.The second problem is that it lingers for far too long on the Battle of Helms Deep.  True, I have not read the books in years, but I don't remember that much attention being paid to this battle.  I think it was just an excuse to focus on Aragorn so women would sit through the movie, and also to make sure the audience remembered the spectacular visual effects.The third problem is the most pervasive.  As I recall, the book was mostly about the Frodo & his relationship with Gollum.  In the film, Elijah Wood is given little to do besides swoon under the Ring's power.  And Gollum is the most compelling character in the film.  He should have been given more screen time.But all in all, this is an excellent film.  I was particularly wowed by the aforementioned special effects, and by Gollum.  I knew when I saw the effects that I was watching CGI animation.  But the only times I could truly *see* that was when Gollum made a particularly rubbery smile, or when Treebeard showed an expression other than annoyance on his face.  I also really liked the way Gollum was portrayed by Andy Serkis, and the particular attention paid to the internal battle between Good Smeagol and Wicked Gollum.I think my favorite thing about the movie, though, was Treebeard and the other Ents.  In many ways they reminded me of the clay figurines come to life in "Heavenly Creatures" (the first Peter Jackson film to have an impact in the U.S. other than as just a cult phenomenon)."The Fellowship of the Ring" was the best film of its type to come along since "The Empire Strikes Back", and "The Two Towers"--although it may not be the masterpiece that "Fellowship" was--proves that "The Lord of the Rings" (barring a truly wretched "Return of the King") is the best trilogy since the original "Star Wars" trilogy.  9 out of 10.


                
The Two Towers is an interesting film. It dosen't have a beginning and it doesn't have an end it's just their keeping 1 and 3 together. Gollum was a breakthrough in CGI and filmaking. After I saw the Two Towers I said to myself "CGI can do anything now." Besides the way he looked Andy Serkis was great as the voice of Gollum. I personally thought he deserved a nomination for best supporting actor. Their two things that ticked me off a little though, one was how Gandalf was not in the movie nearly as much as he should have been. He kinda just came and left. I read the books and I was hoping that Gandalf would be shown gathering the Rohirrim riders. Also something else that confused me in the movies is that, at the battle of Helm's deep elves show up?? That never happened in the book either but I guess their are things that are needed to be changed for a movie. Anyways besides those two things the movie was phenomenal. Peter Jackson did the best job anybody could do on a movie like this and it defiantly deserved it's nomination for best picture. The battle for Helm's deep was truly breathtaking to watch. When they defend the keep that exact moment was taken right out of the book and exactly how I pictured it. Well done Mrs. Walsh and Mr. Jackson you have done an amazing job on the script and movie.
Nothing is quite like LOTR. This middle slice is perfectly paced, utterly breathtaking in its story beats and visuals. The score is incredible and seamless with what is on screen, it excels in every single area. From the exhilarating battle sequences (helms deep) to the quieter moments that pack just as much of a punch balanced with levity brought through the banter of dwarf and elf. If you haven't seen it watch fellowship and then this one. A stone cold masterpiece of a trilogy.


                
This film is almost as good as the first one but it lacks some qualities that made the first film amazing. It is a little slow and nothing really happens until the battle of helms deep. It still is a definite recommend


                
Not as riveting as the first one but still a worthy part of the series, and necessary to move on to the excellent third movie.
