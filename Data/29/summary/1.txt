 Typical Spielberg: All Frosting, No Cake

 Spielberg must really hate Germans

 Morally Weak Film Based on Flawed Sentimentality

 Saving Mister Spielberg

 Self-medication, Mr. Spielberg?

 Laughable pro-war propaganda movie

 Pretty bad history

 People should know the facts.

 Disappointing

 Big Movie, Little Mind.

 WAR, huh, what is it good for?

 Not a valid portrayal of Neptune

 What an awful movie (some spoilers)!

 Immensely Overrated

 The Most Overrated Film Of All Time?

 B-movie about D-day.

 The Goonies goto war: As George W. Bush would tell you how WWII went down.

 A big disappointment

 The worst war movie of all time

 Pro war, sentimental, and manipulative

 It's not history, although ambitious

 Tripe

 Awful. Loathsome. Repellant. Unworthy of Spielberg.

 Another generic mind numbing con-job from spielberg

 What exactly are you trying to say?
