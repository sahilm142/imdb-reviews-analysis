Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's "genius" is concerned. Not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big "S" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.Among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/. It isn't ever so multi-faceted. And it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries.Better to have made Will a basketball prodigy. Except that Damon's too short.


                
So many fans, so little to show for it.  I know, I know, these words are gonna find me in a great minority.  A lot of people really liked Good Will Hunting.  But seriously please, great film making, not even close, and let's put the blame where it belongs...  in the writing.Now, I know they won an oscar for it, and boy did they look good emoting on the screen.  But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.What this movie does show, is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons.  And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great Made for TV movies (although, not HBO films, HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice, little film, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while.  And of course, the Miramax public relations machine secured Ben and Matt their screenwriting oscar... but come one people... there's better movies out there thatn GWH.


                
I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're "supposed" to sob -- or at least feel "touched". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly "It's not your fault" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. I guess I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.Folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal. Worse yet, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all cliched.I gave it 1 out of 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just quite mediocre... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so I figured a single balancing vote won't hurt.


                
Good Will Hunting is a story about a genius who for various reasons has not been able to take advantage of this and, when we are introduced to him in the film, is working as a cleaner at a university. This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsgård. And it goes from there.I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers. I would have no problem with this, if this was a good movie, which unfortunately, it is not. Minnie Driver also is not good looking enough for her part to be believable.Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite directors, although I find his later more "experimental" movies - like Elephant, Paranoid Park and Psycho - much more rewarding as opposed to his earlier work which is more conventional and main stream. The main problem with this film though lies within the script, so I suppose he did what he could with what he was given in this case. For a movie to be entertaining, gripping and interesting, you need a conflict. I fail to find such a thing in this motion picture, and I did look for it the entire running time.It is a mystery as to what you are supposed to feel for the main character in this film. It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be: A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake: It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive: Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play. When I saw Matt Damon in this film all I could think of was his involuntary part in Team America: World Police. "MATT DAMON!". Even though he was played by a doll in that film, his part seemed more real than in Good Will Hunting.


                
This is one of the most overrated films I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.  I didn't care about any of the characters and the dialogue was incredibly pretentious.  It made me ill.  Some posters on here have chosen to belittle those who give this a low rating.  My reply to you is that I deal with the real world and real people everyday and think this movie is absurd.  The world revolves around Damon's character and the ludicrous scene in the bar made me want to puke.  "How do you like them apples?"  "Let's go eat caramels."  What profound dialogue!  This guy is just too cool.  Give me a break.  If I met people like this in real life I would tell them to grow up or label them a phony.  This is the Anti-American Indie movie in all its self-importance.


                
10 years ago I've watched it. And it gave me only pain ever since. Pure and clear, I hate this movie. Rather, what's here to love ?! Let me tell you, the moment when (Robin Williams) was talking about his wife who farted till she waked herself up, the joke of the girl in the café about old people's love, the stupid never-ending lecture about genius guys (which seems copied, as it is, from many books), all of that are little instances for how disgusting and boring this movie is. Actually, this is what lived from it with the poor me. And when it comes to its cast, then let me bleed with hate; (Ben Affleck) is underrated actor, he is, since he isn't cursed appropriately yet! (Minnie Driver) is one of the silliest and ugliest human beings I have ever seen, I can't imagine people who stand her, and if there are any, call me out. (Matt Damon) is so cold and unconvincing in mostly all what he does. There is a good story there, but totally murdered by adolescent script and provocatively mute direction. Nothing is beautiful in this movie. And while it's supposed to be touchy, it totally isn't. Save the scene of (Affleck) talking about missing his friend, I didn't enjoy anything. Enough to say that after its ending I blamed myself hardly for setting all through it, and after 10 years I still do. Without further ado, and to be incredibly objective; THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR ME.


                
I know for sure, that if Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had not been the ones credited with having wrote this film, nobody would have seen this film. Whats more, nobody would have cared. This is Hollywood at its "Indie" best. Trying to pretend that some of their hot properties can be artistic as well. The only problem is that this film is so painfully average and predictable, that few film festivals would have given it the time of day, had it not been for the writers. The story is an old one, just set in a bit of a different setting. Young tough, down on his luck, born poor, no future, gets opportunity and betters himself. Ahhh, what a "feel good" story. Please! I just love the scene in the bar where Will shows up the cocky Harvard kid on his knowledge of American History. Damon reels off one of the most laughable historical arguments in American History. The information is accurate, but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument, even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does. It was an average at best movie that was hyped into a masterpiece. I dismiss the Academy, because I know how the Hollywood Insider game is played. I mean, come on, Kim Bassinger and Mira Sorvino have an Academy! LOL! I mean, Beverly Hills Cop won for best screenplay, even though it had been passed around for five years. In reality, this film is ** out of ****. However, did you know that Matt and Ben wrote it? **** out of ****.


                
Sappy.I liked how they went to the "Haaavaad baaa" to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there.Probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job.Just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. "Do you like apples?"the guy nods or something."Well, how'd ya like DEM APPLES!" Wow, that IS genius.Duh, Minnie Driver would give her number to anybody. Robin Williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf. And there's a professor who always wears a priest scarf for no reason.


                
I don't understand the hoopla for this movie.  It was all right, a couple of good moments, but it didn't add up to anything, and I completely forgot the entire experience ten minutes after I was outside the theatre.  Anyone who doesn't like a lot of swearing should stay away, too.  I swear at times, too, but not like these people.  For the most part, an unpleasant time.


                
Awful, nauseating, egotistical, pretentious, amateurish. With God-Like Intelligence and Wisdom, Will Hunting's character is established as he mops the school floor. Without wringing the mop or placing a warning sign for slippery surface, Will carelessly slops water toward several students. If he was so intelligent, it seems to me that he would be able to mop a floor correctly. This is truly a horrible movie on many levels. How does he know everything? We don't see him reading and amassing his encyclopedic knowledge. It appears that Matt Damon spends more time grooming his cute hair-do than perusing mathematics tomes at the library. Ben Affleck was terrible..he is truly a bad actor. Robin Williams was the only bright spot in this black hole of a movie. The award Good Will Hunting should have received was the Golden Turkey Award.
Good Will Hunting could have been an average movie, but it's nothing more than a ($%#)... bad movie. there is nothing you can relate to, it is full of cliche's ... Mat Damon is an awful actor (may be acceptable in some C-production 'hi-school-reunion-kids-got-drunk-movie'). screenplay... well he had an idea... initially - when he was (they were) around page 2 or 3 of the script... and than he took a $4.95 or so 'Screenplay for dummies'... if he didn't do that - this may be almost average movie. this way it is AWFULL and overrated... Robin Williams... Robin... oh the guy who acts 'dead poet's society' each time he sees the camera? even if it is the camera in the K-Marts.... don't mention it


                
Um... Maybe I just didn't get it... but everyone thinks i am a freak with no soul because i hated this movie...I will tell you why i hated it...First off, i began to literally fall asleep in the middle of the movie because this movie was very very boring. The story absolutely sucked. I don't see how these guys won a best screenplay for this. The dialogue was painfully forced and unrealistic--am I supposed to laugh at the "how do you like them apples line".. am i supposed to feel a sense of accomplishment for the character? Instead with that line, and in fact that whole scene and the rest of the movie had me saying "WTF?????"Not to mention that scene in the bar again, but who has conversations at a bar like that? Not even Harvard attendees talk like that at a bar--they are busy doing keg stands and playing beer pong.Where were the basic elements of a good story in this? Rising action--climax--falling action--character development--protagonist--antagonist. Is anyone with me on this...Or am I alone in the world?


                
Why in the world was this movie made?  Why was the script written?  The writers obviously wanted to showcase their command of four-letter words, but they apparently had nothing else on their minds.This has to be one of the most totally empty-headed movies I've ever seen. The plot - if it can be called that - was both pointless and ridiculous. The acting involved getting a bunch of immature people to sit around calling each other names.  I can't imagine ever recommending this movie to anyone.


                
This movie was so boring. My friend and I had a marker fight in the back of the theater, we were so bored. Usually, I love anything Robin Williams is in. While I liked his performance, the rest of the actors and the movie, by definition blew. The plot was slow, the character development was slow. Everything was slow and boring. I am so glad I didn't pay for it, because I would have demanded my money back. I cant remember the last time I ever wasted two hours. I only went because I had a free pass. I am infinitely glad that Damon and Affleck haven't written anything so rampantly horrible since. One good thing about it was, that it cant get much worse than that, and their future attempts can only get better, cant they?


                
This is trite, formulaic rubbish. Why people find this so entertaining is quite beyond me. The writing is immature at best. I read an early draft online and it actually contained an old, and not particularly funny, joke which clearly was going to be passed off as original material before someone obviously stepped and edited it out of the script. For me that says it all. Little imagination, laughably hackneyed worn out characters and a plot with more holes in it than a sieve.We are expected to swallow the fact that he knows more about law, history, mathematics and English literature than the 'experts' we are haplessly presented with in these various fields. OK but how on earth does he achieve this from the public library while holding down a full time job and apparently cultivating lasting friendships with the ne'erdowells with whom he associates, relationships, we are also expected to believe led him regularly into trouble with the authorities?Anyone who knows the 'genius fallen by the wayside' scenario in real life knows only too well that there is never a happy ending. There is no sweet little Robin Williamsesque professor just waiting in the background to help him through it all. It is just painfully stupid Hollywood fluff, he even gets the girl. The only thing he doesn't do is ride off into the sunset on a white horse. I think it was actually a car.
Oh no. This is such a bad movie. It is so boring! I don't need movies with explosions but this movie needs one, bad. I mean nothing is interesting in GWH. I fell asleep in the theatre looking at this and my friend had to wake me up in the end. Go see this if you are suffering from insomnia, I promise you will fall asleep. One thing is good, that it's not as long as Titanic, you needn't suffer for that long.


                
If you are crazy about the word *uck, you will love this movie because that is predominantly going to be all that you will hear.  Oh, and the scene with Minnie Driver in the bar giving her blow job joke is Oscar material. Puh-leeze!


                
I'm amazed that this spume ever got close to winning an Oscar. It only goes to show that no matter how great the accolades or how high the rating you can still end up watching the most appalling drivel, dressed up as some kind of worthwhile exercise in entertainment. Bulls balls, last night I watched "in Bruges" and it was very good, a million miles away from this Oscar winning (substitute prohibited word).OK so now I must get down to a serious criticism of the movie, based on twenty five minutes and twenty seven seconds, after which I couldn't stomach it any more. Where do I start? Hollywood in its purest form is a place (a fantasy) where we are taken and everything is wonderful. But this kind of Hollywood is just a pretend world which is not real and not uplifting either, it neither corresponds to an ideal or a real, it is just pap. It is a depressed fantasy of a reality that never existed. The idea that you have a genius cleaning a college corridor and filling out maths equations on a blackboard, and then having a verbal fist fight with a student at a bar by quoting lots of long words and phrases at him, which will really impress the girl at the bar with the English accent is just so lame, why would anybody think that that was cleaver. Is this film just patronising uneducated but intelligent people or what, I don't know. I give up.


                
Well, for all of you out there who love the F word and MF, this movie is for you.   For anyone who desires a storyline, this one is quite minimal.  Who wants to hear the F word for a whole movie?  If cursing as well as a bonus of bad actors is a movie to you, then see it.  The ironic thing is that I don't mind cursing in a movie so long it's to prove a point; but in this movie, it was meant to be simply crude and I saw no point in it.The story seemed to open up with a reasonable plot, but went nowhere.  I suppose it went downhill the more I saw a preppy type of guy claimed to be a genius, yet making idiotic decisions in life.  I'm sorry, but I just can't even imagine Matt Damon as any sort of a genius.  (sheesh, even the size of his vocabulary is obviously limited to curse words only)The reason so many people like this movie has to be because of the big name actors.  What teenage girl doesn't want to see Matt Damon?  Of course, when he's a main actor in a movie, girls go crazy for him as well as Ben Affleck. With such "good looking guys", what girl wouldn't go crazy for it?The bottom line for this movie is that it's horrible and should realistically be rated NC-17 for the language let alone the horrible acting.


                
I went with my wife to see this in the theater. When the plot failed to go anywhere after an hour, we left.I finally read the entire script, and haven't changed my opinion. Why should I care that this guy is throwing his life away? If he can't stay out of trouble, they should have just thrown him in jail. End of movie.0 stars out of 4.


                
Don't spend the entire time while you read this review catching my mistakes and defaming me. It won't change anything. I have an IQ of 140. Not extraordinary, but not so bad either. This is how intelligent people are represented in our society. Every film one sees about this subject touts the virtues of the retard, and deprecates and misrepresents the smart. The ultimate example of this stuff, The Mighty, last year's film starring Sharon Stone tells the story of her son (in the movie), who is a sickly boy who will soon outgrow his bones. His organ will be too large for the space between the bones and he'll die. And he does. The only mitigating factor is that he meets a boy his age who is all muscle and no brains. Together with this boy Stone's son can get about. It's like the old joke "Well, I'm the bum whole and if I shut down operations, you'll all be in torture, including you stupid brain! This movie Good Will Hunting is like so many movies from the kind of people who have given us things like child protection services, repressed memories suits, the abuse excuse in court, etc. America lives in an orgy of equalization, destroying everything and anything that looks better, let along outstanding. In a word intelligent people are all inbalanced and a constant problem. Only a mildly retarded social worker can help them.


                
The constant  profanity jarred rather than added realism, and did little more than distract and make it seem the actors were trying much too hard. Though Will may have been a genius, but the writers sure are not.  The formulas in this film are familiar to any 2nd Year maths student in university.  The performances and direction, however,  are very appealing, turning the cliched and typical plot into an enjoyable film.


                
I won't reveal anything about the plot, it just wouldn't be fair. But I will say one thing: Unique screenplay and great actors always guarantee a memorable movie. And this film makes no exception to that. I've never seen Matt Damon in any other film before this, and I have to say I was simply blown away by Damon's superb acting and his and Ben Affleck's first-class screen writing skills. Robin Williams is the right choice as the unconventional psychiatrist, Will's friends all do a great job and Minnie Driver plays an excellent role too. Good Will Hunting is at the same time funny, fascinating and touching, and avoids turning into an embarrassing study of how human mind really works. Even clichés don't feel like clichés in this brilliant film. These kinds of movies really make your brain tick. Well.. Mine at least. As a closure: GO RENT THIS MOVIE ASAP! (You won't be disappointed or if you are, blame yourself for not understanding a masterpiece when you see one.)


                
I can't believe how melodramatic, dull, boring, and overrated this movie is. This is one of the most well-loved films ever, but I hated this movie. Absolutely hated it. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. :PNormally, I like Matt Damon, but I couldn't stand his character was in this movie. For an actor who was just starting out, I think he might have been trying a little bit too hard, if not way too hard.This is an over-dramatic and boring movie, and Robin Williams didn't help. Robin Williams was such a funny actor (RIP), but his character was dull and boring. I don't think any comedian's character should be this serious. How about a little bit more pizazz? I'm sorry. I know several people like this movie, but I feel guilty for wasting two hours of my day sitting through this movie. :(


                
I'm being pretty harsh but this is just not a serious project. This is basically written by a 1st year undergrad, could not be more tacky, predictable, boring and superficial. We've heard those lines before, we've seen those scenes before, the story is far too unbelievable and reaches too much. What is the story even about ? Please the confrontation in the bar with Havard student, the "owe it to me" scene that is incomprehensible, the numbers of slurs in it, the "it's not your fault", do these people even speak English ? All it is, is a genius that happens to be the most brilliant genius yet no explanation is given why, in the entire country, even the world ! No rally it's a chip flick, the sentimentality is throbbing, the dilogue incorrect, the "jokes" cheesy and incomprehensible.In no way, deserving best picture and original script.Matt Damon is a poor actor.
