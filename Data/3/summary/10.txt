 Breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur...

 To call it a sequel is a travesty

 The Greatest Film Ever Made

 Great ensemble acting, great story, greatest sequel ever made.

 One of the greatest sequels ever made

 "The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made, one of the greatest films of all time and possibly finer than its superb predecessor *****"

 Terrific continuation of the "Godfather" series; to call it a "sequel" almost seems insulting...

 An Insult To Call It A Sequel

 A Masterpiece

 A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Godfather of all sequels

 About as good as the first one, but mainly because of De Niro

 Overwritten Script Takes Away from What Could-Have-Been

 even better than part 1

 I really think this is the greatest movie ever made...

 The Continuation of the Corleone Family Saga of Ambition,Ruthlessness and Amorality Is Once Again A Masterpiece

 The Greatest Movie the World has Ever Seen...

 My Favorite Sequel

 Requiem for a Dream

 The Continuing Saga Of The Corleones

 Sequel + Prequel = monumental film-making

 The Godfather Part II

 My Review

 The best sequel ever

 The Godfather never forgets,nor he ever forgives.

 This should be #1 in the top 250 here in IMDb.
