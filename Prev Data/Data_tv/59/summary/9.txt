 When in Rome ....... remember to cross the Rubicon

 Epic series about the struggle for power in ancient Rome......

 An Informative, Exciting and Compelling Historical Masterpiece!

 Oh come on!! Where's season 3!!?????

 A True Spectacle

 'Rome' is full of sex and violence<U+0085> it is also a great story

 One of the most powerful series I've seen yet.

 Some casting gripes, but all in all - A Magnificent Series!

 I love it , but...

 " The City of Rome as seen through the eyes of an artist "

 Wonderful TV

 Rome

 Awesome series

 A modern masterpiece.

 History lessons

 Not Great, But Certainly Worthwhile

 Season 1 "ROME"

 The Gory Glory of the Roman Empire

 Don't see the minor historical inaccuracies to take away from the film at all.

 Best Thing to come from HBO yet!

 Rome Season 1

 Very interesting take on a familiar story

 I Am Hooked!!!!

 The 1st Triumvirate and the 2nd Civil War

 Hugely enjoyable series
