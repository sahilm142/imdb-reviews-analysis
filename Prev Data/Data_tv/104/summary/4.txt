 (If you really are open to other views<U+0085>) The chemistry has been forced to death.

 9.5 Seriously?

 Top Gear with forced chemistry and without heart

 sorry... i was really on your side

 Formula isn't right and crude jokes are unwanted

 Plastic Version of Top Gear

 A sad, overcompensating version of the original

 4 stars for the cars only.....occasional giggle....zerograteful ness

 They've found another gear

 Pretty disappointing

 Below average

 Getting very boring

 A huge disappointment

 Season 3 a real mixed bag

 When is the tour over?
