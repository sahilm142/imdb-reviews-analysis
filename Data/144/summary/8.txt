 Robert De Niro, an icon of the contemporary Hollywood crime film...

 Typically fantastic Scorcese film

 Very good but not without flaws

 Ultimately, a mafia film about mafia men's attempts to colonize an unfamiliar environment

 Great Acting, Great Plot...

 Very skillful movie

 Crime in the underground showbiz.

 Odds are great you'll enjoy this

 One of the most under-rated movies ever.

 Very good movie

 Scorsese on Scorsese

 Jealousy. Greed. Ego. Desire.

 Casino was and still is a great Gangster movie

 The more I see the more I like it

 Martin Scorsese classic

 This movie will bring us back to dreamland era 90th

 Lengthly, But Still Quintessential Scorsese.

 Play the movie, Mr Scorsese

 Long But Dosen't Stop Being Interesting,

 "Great Crime Drama!"

 Scorsese Shows The Dark Side Of Vegas Perfectly.

 Another pretty decent film from the Scorsesee lot

 Rousing

 More influential than its given credit for being

 Good mob movie with a lifetime movie thrown in the middle
