Carnivale is something incredible,it has a great cast, a good basic story but something fails...it's extremely slow. For those who have read the comic Ghost Rider and specially Spirits of Vengeance, in some way feels like human version of the adventures of the strange carnival of San Quentin, only this time the origins of this members is unknown and the stories have less action(of course they don't have riders like Johnny blaze) and with more mystery. Miniseries like Babylon 5 tells big stories using in the best way every minute of every episode leaving at least some good to keep you ready and almost "crazy" waiting the next chapter; in the beginning (by obvious reason) did that, but after a few episodes the amazing of the story dissolves itself in the extremely slow way to showing it, leaving the sensation of being losing the time to find nothing real good. I know, Clancy Brown is great actor and his role is wonderful as the other members of the cast, everyone makes great job but maybe it's the style of Ronald D. Moore (the New Battlestar Galactica it's good but It's also too slow). It's a shame because Carnivale has all to be one of the best shows of the year, but it's something terribly bored not something too unpredictable to maintain you counting the days to know what's coming in the next chapter.
