 What Can Be Said about This Show?

 I love it.

 A really cool show.

 Came in 2002 (Where I live), looked like garbade, but underrated

 Weird, don't you think?

 Probably the greatest animated series of alltime.

 The Best Anime Series, Toriyama = genius

 One word: The Best!

 YES! YES! THE GREATEST SHOW OF TIME!

 Best Anime Ever

 The best anime in the world.......to only the most ignorant and unexposed

 Should only be watched in the Japanese

 Listen up...

 Over criticized but still with flaws

 quality anime

 AWESOME SHOW! (yet destroyed in the English dub)

 Not just a show, but an inspiration

 the best anime ever

 Kept Me On My Toes and Enjoyable as Hell

 Better than Yu Yu Hakusho

 They should have stopped with this one.

 Dragonball Z

 Not for everyone

 The poster child for serialized anime in the late 80s early 90s...
