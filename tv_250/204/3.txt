In the 60's Stanley Kubriak and Kirk Douglas made Spartacus. Spartacus was an epic film, well acted, well directed and well scripted. Spartacus is a legendary epic film. Since the popularity of 300, Spartacus was remade as a terrible movie and now as this joke of a series. The characters are absolutely ridiculous, the script is terrible, the look is a ripoff of 300, and the acting is sub par. It is hilarious to see people running around in snow with just a loin cloth upon them, when you know no one would be able to suffer that cold. It is a joke to see a warrior and his wife flee a destroyed village and stop to have a sexual encounter, when in reality he would have been on alert all night long watching for the enemy. This series is awful, uninspired, poor made, all hoping to gain momentum from ripping off 300 and the upcoming Clash of the Titans. The use of the name Spartacus is to add something familiar to draw the crowd, since nothing is accurate about the legend of Spartacus in this garbage.


                
If you liked "300" for its over the top everything, blood, and sex, then this is just what you have been waiting for. If you are looking for another "Rome" just keep on looking. This series is not for people who liked "Rome." You are not going to find good acting, dialogue, writing, or likable characters here. What you will find is a spiritual sequel to "300" and all the fun stuff and green screens that went with it. There is no substance but it is still fun. Three episodes in and I am done with it. I figured I would give the show a chance and I have seen all I want to see. I adored HBO's "Rome" and this is a silly joke in comparison.Everything in Rome seemed larger than life: set pieces, historical figures, battles, roman politics. "Blood and Sand" offers blood...and sand. Do yourself a favor and watch the old Spartacus and stay away from this show.


                
Season 1 was great: bold, fresh, an impressive accomplishment. The prequel (Gods of the Arena) was clever and tight. Season 2, however, is a big disappointment: flabby, meandering, so pompous that it verges on ridiculous. The writers lost focus; gore and sex became a means in themselves; both heroes and villains became unidimensional. The main flaw, however, lies in Spartacus himself. Where Andy played him gracefully, with the gravitas, sadness and self-doubt the character deserved, the new actor, whose name I ignore, carves a sneering, humorless, self-righteous, vengeful, fairly dumb and ultimately boring man. In fact, we care more for Crixus or Lannicus now than for Spartacus himself. Add to that the lack of good & believable villain and you will have a recipe for failure.The change is so striking that perhaps it is intentional. The sad fact is that Spartacus went from an adult series to something with the same depth of an "ultimate fighter" video game for teenagers.


                
As the miraculously survived abortive fetus of 300 and a softcore porno, it is quite possibly the trashiest TV show to ever be mistakenly classified as "premium" cable. With the script and directing you would expect from an entrepreneurial high school freshman boy, there is more blood than a Rob Zombie film, more unnecessary slow motion than a Football's Greatest Plays mash-up on ESPN, and more nudity than an unfiltered Google Image search for "girls gone wild." And as for all the comments about "it's really a historically accurate depiction," just...no. Clothes were not optional and orgies didn't happen between every gladiatorial fight. Try looking for a more bearable movie series to avoid feeling your maturity quotient decay exponentially with every minute watched.


                
I decided to give this show a chance as friends told me great things about it.The first thing I noticed was the sheer amount of CGI present, to the point that they might as well have just made it an animated series. Over use of CGI these days puts me off straight away, unless its at least done well like in 300 rather than just looking tacky and cheap which it does in Spartacus. The acting is also pretty ludicrous at times and had me laughing at the emotional scenes and macho bull-crap alike.Its not all bad though, there's some nudity and sex (though completely pointless and rather boring) and the fight scenes can be entertaining as they look almost exactly like 300 fights with slow down speed up shots and CGI blood everywhere, but to the point where its obvious they just copied the style directly from 300 rather than borrowing a few aspects.This might be a show that you can sit down with a few mates and have a laugh with, but don't look for any real content or realism because there is none.


                
I just watched the first episode of "Spartacus: Blood and Sand" and I have to say that i was somewhat disappointed. I'm a great fan of series with this kind of genre and I really enjoyed the 'Rome' series. But with this first episode.. i found it kind of distasteful. Blood, boobs and the word F*CK times 10. That's about it in a nutshell. They portray the people of Rome like some wild beasts and the women all hang their breasts out while they scream and eat bread.. I guess it wasn't really the point of the maker to portray a story based upon truth. It's brought to the viewer like a myth, distasteful and vulgar. The lines are kind of cheesy and not at all truth based. There were some plus points though: - the acting wasn't that bad.. it was OK. - the special effects were kind a cool. Blood and Gore.. felt like I was playing a life-like video game.I hope this series will develop in the future and get lots better. It has great potential, but the boobs and the blood... come on.. they should learn from the Rome series...!
I've been seeing previews for Spartacus: Blood and Sand for a long time. I have to admit, it looked intriguing, and I gave more than a moment's thought to subscribing to Starz to check it out. I was in luck a few weeks ago when there was a free preview, and I had a chance to catch 2 episodes. I only watched 1. I was appalled. There was little more than gratuitous sex and violence that added absolutely nothing to the plot...not that there was much of a plot.It was visually stunning, but that's the best that can be said for it. The acting was wooden, and the cursing was both inappropriate and overused. Perhaps they took a page from HBO's Deadwood by dropping profanities all over the place, but in both situations, it didn't seem in keeping with the era. Though I'm not an expert on either time period, I just can't get my mind around the idea that ancient Romans would use that kind of language, especially since the etymology of the words as they were used don't suggest the terminology was in use that far back in history. (Yes, I did a little homework before writing this review.) I'm all for meaningful cursing, but it was excessive in Spartacus: Blood and Sand, and completely unnecessary. The movie "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe was superior in every way to this made-for-TV tripe, and all the more captivating for the lack of swearing.Another thing I had trouble getting my mind around (through no fault of his) was the choice to cast John Hannah as Batiatus. John Hannah is a fine actor, but after seeing him as Rachel Weisz's goofy brother in The Mummy movies, seeing him as a calculating Roman aristocrat didn't work for me.Not a single cast member stood out as being exceptional. Maybe my opinion was colored by the fact that this series was so incredibly over-hyped, but it was really a letdown, and I wasted an hour of my life watching the 1st episode. I was so turned off that I didn't care to bother with the 2nd episode. I think the program caters to the lowest common denominator with shocking violence, needlessly graphic sex and cussing that would be far more appropriate in a modern day sports locker room than ancient Rome. Beautifully filmed, but not even the soundtrack was good. Bad taste all around, best left to the teenage boys it seems to be trying to attract, and not worth a second glance as far as I'm concerned.


                
My review is about the 3d season, "War of the Damned", I think it's not yet separated on IMDb but okay.I really liked the first season, the battles in the arena, the training and the building of characters. Battles were bloody but realistic. Spartacus grew form a soldier to a extremely good hand to hand fighting gladiator and a charismatic person. In the end off course he escaped the Ludus together with some of the gladiators after thrashing the place and killing everybody inside.Second season got a little more unrealistic, a small group of dedicated and well trained warriors can do a lot of damage as we all see on a daily base on the news in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria etc. But taking down a complete arena in the middle of a Roman occupied town??? Second season ends like it happened in history with a victory for Spartacus on the slopes of Vesuvius.Third Season.....here it gets a bit over the top. Starts to look like a B-action movie, outnumbered and out gunned "Good-guys" take out hundreds or thousands of Roman trained soldiers ("Bad-guys") with only minor losses... It's even getting a bit slapstick to watch Spartacus, Crixus and Gannicus running toward Roman formations (known for being impenetrable) and just jumping on top of them hacking and slashing cutting them down by the numbers.. For me personally the rebels have also lost my sympathy after roaming, pillaging and killing "innocent Romans" just minding their business, specially after the taking of the City Sinuessa when they murdered everybody except a handful of Romans. It got a bit over the top, I'm waiting for the final episode now only because I'm curious how the producers are going to kill this historical story even further...Long story short, started good but ended like a b-action slapstick movie with a lot of blood and guts.
Spartacus must have the best after work parties - everybody is already naked, there are plenty of 'tools' lying around, not counting free food, alcohol and costumes. Also, this show mark the moment when Hollywood decided to take over the porn industry. Soon will see highly praising reviews about movie stars 'doing' each other ! Sarcasm aside, Spartacus do have a raw appeal based on two simple lines : 'me smash your skull' and 'me want your body ... harrrr'. At least, actors seem to have a good time, even those who die from atrocius wounds in the arena - they still curse, laugh or throw jokes around! In the end, Spartacus it's a neverending display of straigth-from-the-gym gladiators who fight almost naked, disregarding self preservation and try to look dangerous by the means of shouting and fake battles. I endured through the first season and I think I saw everything worth mention, Time to move on.
When I say "boring," I don't mean the story. The story is actually very interesting, as that whole period of our history is anyway.No, "boring" is for the production. The blood, the gore, the sex... It's mildly curious (entertaining, even?) the first couple of times stuff like that is shown but then it gets tedious and predictable. As others have stated here: It's GRATUITOUS. I never really knew what the concept of "gratuitous" meant in practice, but THIS, is it! Now, I'm no prude. I don't swoon at the idea or sight of blood, guts, decapitations, etc. on television or in video games, nor do I think they should be banned or even regulated all that strictly.It's just that having what-looks-like gallons of blood splashed across the screen every five minutes or having 3-4 soft-sex scenes per episode does not contribute to, aid, or benefit the show in any way. It doesn't make it more realistic; it doesn't make it more entertaining (unless you're a cocooned 12-year-old seeing "violence" for the first time); it doesn't make the viewer feel more involved or sympathetic. It appears that such scenes are there only to shock the prissy old grannies who still care about violence on T.V. It's like: "Hey, look at us, we've got blood galore and sex galore on a show about a historical topic. We're real f!@#ing pioneers!!" Give me a break.And what's with the British accents?!? Has Hollywood's supply of talent and wannabe talent dried up? Or is it that, for some reason, a show cannot possibly be "historical" unless the actors speak in an English that's spoken by a tiny fraction of global English speakers?
"spartacus: god of arena" and "spartacus: blood and sand" are two great "spartacus" series, but "spartacus: vengeance" and "spartacus: war of the damned" are suddenly turned into two lame and horrible series. the actor who played the new spartacus was not as good as the actor who played spartacus in "blood and sand". he was a disconnected choice to play such role. there's no spiritual power or physical dominance whatsoever in this actor. also, the screenplay (script) seemed to suddenly became so weak and uninteresting, even some of the actors who appeared in the first two series still played the similar roles, but they acted differently and performed worse than before. the director and the screenplay writers also seemed to be so different from the first two seasons, so inferior and so mindlessly bored to the extreme. i had craved so uncontrollably to the first two seasons, and enjoyed all of the episodes. but the latter two seasons were just so tastelessly boring. those actors who played those once adorable roles in the first two seasons, well, they abruptly fell so flat. i think that replaced the actors, the director, the screenplay writers and anyone who originally involved in the first two seasons were just bad choices. i don't think i could continue to keep watching the coming new episodes, because so far, all the new episodes just turned out so boring and so lame, even the special graphic blood splashing effect is still look alike.


                
The previews for this series got my attention but, I was very disappointed. I stuck it out through the whole 13 episodes hoping it would get better, NOT till episode 11. Now that everyone is free, I don't see why they would continue the series just to defeat the Romans. Out of the box in episode 1 it explains this has nothing to do with the actual Spartacus (biggest disappointment). It has way too much nudity, sex and foul language through out the series. The stop animation used is nothing new and didn't improve it any. Special effects, where (cartoon blood)? Acting was fair at modest. This show needs to be axed before season 2 gets underway.
I don't get why people like this series so much. I have no problem with the violence or the nudity (though it does seem quite forced and one can almost see the writers going "ok, it's been 10 minutes without a breast or an ass--time to throw one in!), but the acting is appalling. Manu Bennet as Crixus is laughable--so wooden you could make a chair out of him. The same can be said of the rest of the cast. One almost begins to think that its intended as a spoof of the Rome/gladiator series. the silly montages that show him merging across seasons or rocky-type training scenes are so.... bizarre. the use of computer graphics just to show the audience that, yes, we can use computer graphics and the absurd amounts of blood that flow from every part of the body (yet he still stands and wins... hmmm....)and why did they even bother setting it in ancient Rome if they weren't going to engage with the historical component? it's supposed to be a historical drama yet it seems that they only engage with it to distort it...in short, a massive, lost opportunity. sort of a fox version of Rome. stars is obviously hoping to emulate HBO's success and perhaps they have done so commercially, but only by appealing to the lowest common denominator instead of creating something truly excellent.


                
I looked into this show because of the high ratings on IMDb and had hoped for a poor man's GoT. I'm choosing to write a review because there is such a huge discrepancy between the ratings on IMDb and the quality of the show.A quick note on the action style: It is similar to 300. Exaggerated blood and alternation between slow motion and sped up cameras. It's heavy on the CGI. Whether or not that's a good thing is a matter of personal taste.There is indeed a lot of nudity and violence in the show. I don't mind either one bit but it seems plausible that the show's staff is trying to thrust these elements into the show because they believe it will sell. Neither is presented as a natural part of the story or human nature but instead they play out with the plausibility of pornography. The gore is cartoonish and detracts from the tension of the show and the nudity is so out of character in some of the scenes that the actors look uncomfortable going along.Speaking of the actors looking uncomfortable, the acting is pretty bad. It's not the worst thing we've ever witnessed in a sword and shield movie but the majority of the cast seems to have been chosen for physique rather than their ability to deliver even a modestly convincing line. Although Andy Whitfield's performance is one of the strongest in the show it is merely mediocre. The praise he receives on this board is particularly baffling. One has to wonder what people have been watching that they think he's a fabulous actor.The sets are poor for a show with a budget so large. It's hard to figure out what they're spending their money on with such a shallow talent pool and such poor sets. The first episode's "snow" is an especially telling example.The absolute worst part of the show is the writing. Most of the lines would easily work in a badly done parody of Gladiator (think Scary Movie, not Monty Python). At least half of the lines are so banal and poorly delivered that it becomes impossible to focus on the story. I watched three nonconsecutive episodes searching for an improvement in the acting, sets and most of all the writing. I was unable to find relief from any of the three. As such, it would be unfair for me to comment on the story but I find it unlikely that these writers are going to come up with anything original plot-wise.


                
I started watching this show simply because I was bored.And I will say its highly overrated. Most of the fighting looks good at first,but after a couple of fights you see the pattern in it.=wide telegraphic blows,and never go for the unprotected feet,always give opponent time to gather himself and stand up,after he had been sent to the ground.Just so you can prolong the fight scene. People in here complain about the all the cussing.Make no mistake the series is full of it.Every Other word is F this and C & ball up your a** But what bothers me the most is the endless mind numbing babbling from actors who look bored.Though in all fairness their character is suppose to look rich and bored,there's just too much of it. Only broken by an occasional sword fight or an orgy, just so you won't change channel. It pick up the pace a bit midway during second and third season but not enough to save it for me. Spartacus fights too fair, when he should have fought as dirty as can. and too primitive for the story to work.And the cgi is still crap.The whole thing is like watching rocky vs the roman empire. Rocky always win. They always hold long speeches before killing someone,or pause in the midst of the battle.That was what annoyed me the most. The whole stop and pause in the middle of a battle against overwhelming odds,just so the hero can take a smaller flesh wound. Oh did I forget to mention that every little nick & cut spout fountains of blood.The material is there,so it could've been good.But they ruin it with too much dialog and too much fake blood and slow motion where its never needed.And a severe lack of tactic.The only battle I ever saw tactic in was the last one *******warning spoiler******spoiler******* ****spoiler^****** Where Spartacus dies in the end simply because he pauses,when she should have killed his opponent. conclusion.Watch if you wanna see Lucy Lawless/Xena the warrior princess T&A and full frontal. If not stay away
