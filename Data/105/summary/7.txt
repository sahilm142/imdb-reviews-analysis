 The Oliver Stone-scripted 'Scarface' is a change in genre...

 Three Men of Excess

 Taking advantage of the land of the free. Crime does have a price.

 awful, yeah?

 Things Go Better With Coke

 Scarface

 Sympathizing with the Bad Man

 Fascinating storytelling, not so fascinating lead performance

 Say hello to our little film...

 Manolo - You Should Have Called Dude

 Good movie.

 Tony Montana

 Good, but ironically usurped

 Impossible to dislike

 Gangster film!

 Al Pacino delivers pure movie dynamite!

 Certainly not a masterpiece

 It's good but not that good

 I remembered it as better!!

 Good, but too long, boring at times.

 While I liked it...

 A above-average film that achieved greatness because of the 'glamour' syndrome..

 A good film, but extremely overrated and didn't reach my expectations

 Gangster film with humanity
