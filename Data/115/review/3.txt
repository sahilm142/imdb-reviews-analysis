If ever there was (is or will be) a film destined to have critics grovel over it, it's a film where a critic is the smartest man in the room and who gets the hot chicks. It's also appealing to all reporters/journalists in that sense. Another artistic technicality well played for an otherwise dull soap opera.It's apropos that the film itself is cynical and paranoid and promotes such a view of the world.It does manage to be an inside, self promotional, look at both Hollywood and theater and its vicious recursive circle of stardom. An early look at the transition from plays/theater to Hollywood and the desire even in the late 1940s to be a movie star. Not much else. It doesn't age well. It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s.Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance. If anything, this post-war soap opera of seriousness where none is deserved is a reflection of one of the main failings of a film industry at the time that missed the full potential of a real life Betty Boop in Marilyn Monroe. Painfully uninventive like a typical critic.
