 Groundbreaking!

 Welcome to Jurassic Park.... Noodles Review

 The best dinosaur movie there is; one of the best movies in general

 My favorite Movie

 Unlike anything the world had ever seen before.

 A milestone in cinematic history, a huge achievement in CGI effects, and by the most well-known director in the world.

 A legend

 A genre staple gets a much deserved re-release in 3D and IMAX.

 Excellent

 I'm amazed this isn't in the top 250!!

 The way all blockbusters should be...

 I LOVE this movie!

 Dino-Mite!!

 90's Epicness

 My all-time favorite movie going experience

 Welcome to Jurassic Park... Best... Line... Ever!

 Dinosaurs and humans collide in Steven Spielberg's classic about a billionaire who opens an amusement park where he brought back to life Dinosaurs!

 ...the real world is much smaller than the imaginary.

 How Is this NOT in the top 250?

 Great great movie, great actors, great effects, great music, great EVERYTHING!

 Great Film!
