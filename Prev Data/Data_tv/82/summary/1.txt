 Calling this sharp and funny just doesn't do it justice.

 Amazing and hilarious satire

 Simply sublime

 Excellent

 Possibly one of the greatest pieces of television in any genre

 Mortified!!

 Dry humor in maniacal proportions

 the office + yes minister = a slice of pure fried gold

 Pure Gold!

 Genius! Incredibly intelligent script!

 Fantastic.

 Better Than The Americans

 Nigh perfect yet almost completely destroyed by moronic shakycam.

 Hey, Malcolm, go die in a grease fire!

 Fantastic show ruined by a shaky camera effect

 Brilliant content ruined by shakycam.

 BBC satire at its best !

 Brilliant, and the greatest politics-centric TV series ever made

 Brilliantly muddy

 Really wanted to watch this but the constant camera shake makes me dizzy

 The Thick of It

 The best British political satire ever!

 Brilliant dialogue ruined by dire camera-work

 The acting is great!

 The closest the 21st century has come to Shakespeare.
