 A magnificent piece of cinema. Spectacular in every respect

 Unforgettable

 DOWNFALL is essential and indispensable watching for outstanding performance by Bruno Ganz

 A German opinion....

 Compelling But With One Serious Flaw

 'Grim' Look At The Nazis' Final Hours

 grimly fascinating film

 Fascinating but Cold German Entry into its own History.

 Important, Provocative, Should be required for every High School Student

 by the way, academy awards ignore them

 Serious Movie making!!!

 Well worth seeing...

 Brilliant humanising portrayal of Hitler's final days.

 A perfect portrayal of the final peak of Germany's darkest time

 Sympathetic Without Crossing The Line

 History performed with lightning... makes me wish there was more of its kind

 Will we ever learn?

 Docudrama, A Good One.

 Bravo
