 An unnecessarily long saga where a lot happens by chance

 Not recommended for an inquiring mind.

 A piece of garbage

 Utterly repugnant propaganda filled vehicle.

 Misrepresented as watchable

 Idiotic and boring!

 Astonishingly awful

 The Movie that Ate My Brain.....Worst Ever !!!

 do NOT watch it

 Did the writers all quit?

 An overrated hyped miserable movie! I felt like a movie theater prisoner

 The American dream of justice with own hands

 Bullshite movie...

 Won't Cure Insomnia

 Warner Bros. put me through this junk.............

 terrible story,bad ending

 2.5 hours of irretrievable time

 Worst. Movie. Ever.

 If you ignore the absolutely ridiculous plot holes, then it is enjoyable

 Going to my Bathroom was more Suspenseful

 Excruciatingly slow. Seems even longer than it is. And it's long.

 Can I have that 2-1/2 hours of my life back, please?

 I notice a huge lack of intellectual criticism about this movie

 I want my time back!

 Plain bad, don't waste your time!
