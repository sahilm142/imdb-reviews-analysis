 A blockbuster how it was meant to be

 Will stand the test of time forever.

 Harrison Ford, in the role that suited him best...

 Indiana Jones Paves The Way For Lara Croft And Countless Others.

 Unmissable Slam-Bang-Wallop Globetrotting Action Adventure

 Fun Adventure for some

 George Lucas And Steven Spielberg At There Best

 How can you not like it?

 Everything after the first 5 minutes is purely bonus!

 The Ark Should Have Come With A Warning Label

 One of the most iconic films of all time!

 A search of the lost ark

 One of the most iconic heroes of all time in one of the greatest adventures of all time

 Spectacular to say the least

 Awesome..!

 Good for what it is

 Really Good

 Amazing action masterpiece!

 It's not the years; it's the mileage

 Wow

 The Pace of Rebounding A Classic

 A Spielberg Classic

 Timeless adventure masterpiece still as good today as it was in the 80's

 A globe-trotting rip-roaring adventure.
