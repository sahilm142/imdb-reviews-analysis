 exceptionally well made

 A Magnificent Film

 The dream sequences had chills running up my spine...

 One of Bergman's finest

 A Life in Isolation

 Wild Strawberries- Last movie you want to see before you dead.

 a great movie

 It's like the ghosts of Christmas past got the wrong address...

 Masterpiece

 about

 Where the heart is...

 i've never seen such hard dialogs, such hard film

 Bergman Speaks to the Big Questions

 Great

 Reflections of life

 It's the story of a man's parallel journey to a tribute and his suppressed painful past.

 Sheer Quality!

 Old Man reacquires his humanity during a road trip

 A very Swedish film!

 A Life Well-spent?

 Bergman at his peak

 At the end of the day, was it worth it?

 Sensing his time will soon be up

 A great movie about reflecting on life and death

 "Enchanting flashback scenes..."
