 Hatewatched this

 How many plot holes can you fit into one story?

 The series for dummies

 Forced suspense to get watchers hooked and damaging gender stereotypes

 Plot holes, terrible writing, ridiculous characters. Absolutely overrated

 Bad from the start till the end.

 ignore high rating, it is way off

 Absolutely overrated

 A terrible waste of time.

 Not for the critical outlook

 Extremly Overated

 Turn your brain off and watch it

 Very very very bad

 It could be watched as a parody

 Amazingly terrible plots alert.

 Proof the Spanish can also do bad American TV

 Disappointing, and although not deserving of a 1 star rating this SHOULDN'T HAVE an 8.5+ rating here on IMDB

 Bad, boring and BS

 Teenage trend

 Stupidity

 Don't get fooled by the IMDB high rating - it's a scam!

 The series would be cool without the girl from Tokyo.

 Waste of time

 Bad telenovela nonsense!!

 This whole Series feels so off
