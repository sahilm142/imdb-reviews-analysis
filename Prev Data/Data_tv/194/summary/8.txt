 Fun, smart, unique but uneven.

 A great TV show

 Great Show

 not as great as the Simpsons, but I'll watch it every now and again- certainly a very smart sci-fi comedy

 Fantastic Show

 Good Show

 Miss it

 A series enjoyed better later than never!

 A very funny TV show...

 Distinct in itself, great viewing

 so much fun

 Hit and Miss, But with more Unique Story lines than any other Show

 One of the best recent shows

 Funny and incredible-looking, but really people....

 I'll miss it!
