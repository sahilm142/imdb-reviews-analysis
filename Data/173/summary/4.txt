 A Little Overrated?

 Great idea - totally overdone

 A gory disappointment from Tarantino

 One more off the Tarantino production line

 bad

 God Gets Cut

 Not up to Tarantino's usual standards

 Shallow and dull but pretty.

 "I used to be smart, but now I'm just stupid"

 Come on?

 Average at best

 Shame

 wet dream

 Review (no spoilers)

 90 minutes too long

 " ... to be continued."

 hmmmmmm.....

 no style no content

 Ostentatious homage to the 1970s kung fu movies

 Didn't kill Bill, but killed everyone else.

 WTF

 Well, this was pretty bad...

 If it weren't done by Tarantino...

 Uninspiring mess with abscence of Quentin's writing skills

 Look out Joel Schumacher!
