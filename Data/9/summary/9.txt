 Sergio Leone was a highly personal filmmaker!

 Sergio Leone's most visionary film...

 "When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk."

 An Old Idea Reworked

 Fantastic, legendary masterpiece

 Roy Rogers meets the Vatican meets Kurosawa

 The west as a piece of art...

 Visual Literature

 A movie at least 20 years ahead of its time

 A revolutionary and exciting Spaghetti Western

 We're all Tuco

 The good the bad and the ugly

 Great story telling and non conventional film making.

 The BEST western EVER

 Spaghetti Masterpiece

 The Ecstasy of Music is far higher than the ecstasy of gold

 Who are you calling ugly?

 Cinematic brilliance.

 acquaintance with western

 We all know this is great, but here's my 2 cents..

 The best western i've ever seen

 I'm looking for the owner of that horse. He's tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!

 Hands down, the best Spaghetti Western movie ever! "When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk." Sergio Leone knows how to shoot a Spaghetti Western.

 Take A Slug Of This Captain - And Keep Your Ears Open

 Not as good as "Once upon a time in the west" still VERY good!!!
