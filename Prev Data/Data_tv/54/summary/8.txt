 Season 1 (Terrific) Season 2 (incomprehensible)

 9 stars for season 1, but 6 for season 2.

 Beautiful

 Great. Another HBO Gem

 Shame about the 2nd season

 Westworld, a western adult theme park begins to malfunction.

 Watch Season 1, skip season 2.

 Thank you! Real Quality Speculative Fiction !

 OK, its hyped. But if it clouds your review, don't review it.

 Season 2 Review

 Very good, but let's be a bit critical.

 Amazing beginning ... tentatively 8/10

 FINALLY something worth your time

 Westworld looks spectacular!

 a mirror of our world

 Amazing Television So Far!...

 Great TV show, fresh but quite slow

 Robots becoming self-aware, perhaps vengeful against their creators in the process, and all in a show which you can only hope evolves past its familiar tropes.

 Great idea, but ruined in some ways

 Season 1 = Solid.

 Robot Personhood in this Show

 My rate is for the first season

 A Sci-fi mysterious series that causes you actually think!

 Im so torn
