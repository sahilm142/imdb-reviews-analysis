 Amazing animation and style overwhelm a couple plot issues

 At last Sony did something good..

 Incredible animation and a well executed story

 Spider-Man a living legend

 Best animated film of the year

 The way comic book animation should be done

 A great Spider-Man movie, but it's rushed, with underdeveloped characters.

 Animated Film of the Year

 Lego Movie team mature....a little

 The best Spider-Man movie.

 New to comic based films

 Needs more John Mulaney 8/10

 Too flashy, no warning.

 Comic-ou-of-comic-league

 AMAZING!!!

 New, innovative.. Brilliant!

 An amazing comic film!

 Yup, definitely a game changer movie.

 Great but not perfect

 Amazing animation and a spectacular story; pretty much the ultimate Spider-Man picture.

 Spider-Man Comic-Book Comes To Life..!

 Easily One of My Favorite Spider-Man Movies

 Well versed

 Arguably one of the best animation movies ever made.

 Better than any of the live action films
