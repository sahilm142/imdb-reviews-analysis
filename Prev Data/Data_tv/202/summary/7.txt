 Season 2: Still better than Season 8 of The Walking Dead

 Ash is back.

 Still hopeful

 An Ample Series, But Not Without Drawbacks

 Cheesy one-liners with lot's of fun

 Watch this or I'll send deadites after you!!! (Or don't, who cares)

 blood splattering fun

 Encapsulates the essence of the Evil Dead, a fan's dream.

 A great horror show

 Excellent beginning, the following seasons however? Well...

 Over the top fun

 Season 1 and 2 review
