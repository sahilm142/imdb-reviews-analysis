 Actually i was quite bored...

 Nebraskan Blade Runner

 Was this really a ground-breaking Western?

 General Critique

 My mom didn't like this movie, but I didn't mind it (although I wouldn't have given it Best Picture).

 Wild West again

 Good but not superb

 No sure what to make of this

 An exciting and entertaining western. But not one of the bests.

 Unforgiven

 Eastwood can be forgiven - but only just!

 Over rated?

 Quick Reviews!!

 One of the better Best Pictures

 Nothing out of the ordinary.

 The in'Sight' on the movie

 Good but far too safe

 unforgiven in its true sense .... but yet ..... easily forgettable .

 An Essay on Killing

 Moody Western

 Let's give credit where credit is due.

 Disturbing and effective tale ...

 A good movie, however not great

 Pretty good film, but a bit overrated

 a good Westerns , Clint Eastwood learned a lot from Sergio Leone , the master of the Wild West.
