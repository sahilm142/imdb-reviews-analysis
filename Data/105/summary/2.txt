 highly overrated

 What's worse: the film or Pacino?

 This is a masterpiece?

 What's All The Hype About?

 overrated is an understatement

 Most overrated film I've ever seen

 Almost trash,the only thing that saves the film is Al Pacino!!!!!

 To this day, I still don't get the praises for this abortion of a movie.

 I might be hated for this...

 I did not like this movie.

 Pure schlock

 Mostly Dull
