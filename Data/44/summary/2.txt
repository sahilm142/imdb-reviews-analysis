 Nonsense

 I really disliked this movie

 Mr Clean's alter ego meets Little Drummer Boy

 Utterly mystified by the high rating for what is a terrible film

 If you don't like Jazz stay away, if you like Jazz definitely stay away !!!

 excessively success-driven story...so little about feel and art...

 Directorial Intention... doesn't mean it's my cup of tea

 Miles Davis would have hated this movie
