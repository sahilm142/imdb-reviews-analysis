 Tedious and predictable supernatural "thriller"

 Mr Mauve's justification is wrong. PLOT HOLES!

 Overrated

 This is not an in-depth review, just a quick opinion.

 One big problem with this movie.

 The Biggest Cheat in Movie History

 Unbelievable and retarded

 Sick Non-sense.

 I see morons and imbeciles

 Predictable

 A Real Bad Letdown

 Unadulterated Trite

 ITHIS MOVIE STINKS! IT ISN'T A THRILLER, IT ISN'T SUSPENSEFUL, IT'S JUST PLAIN BORING!

 Twisted Serling

 Tedious.

 shpitspingboya

 Stir of Echos got overlooked for THIS!

 WHY OH WHY IS THIS SO POPULAR?!?!?!?

 One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

 Night Bashing

 "I see vast shortcomings!"

 This movie was all hype and gave me nothing!

 pure hollywood manipulation

 Ghost meets Little Man Tate: A dull movie concerned more with "family values," and happy endings than with entertaining its audience.
