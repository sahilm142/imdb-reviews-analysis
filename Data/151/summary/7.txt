 One of those small movies that deserve much more than what will ever be given

 The flip side of freedom

 Beautifully told but fundamentally flawed

 Why does one of the worst movies created only have 'The' in its title to differentiate itself from this extraordinary spectacle

 Starts strong but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end.

 Superb Acting, editing lacking.

 Obligatory "the book was better" comment, but I was still very impressed with the film

 Brie Larson is great, and Jacob Tremblay as well, Sad Movie

 Brilliant at the beginning but dies down towards the end! 7/10

 Heartbreaking

 a strikingly powerful portrayal of love

 Tad bit disappointing

 Sky-light to the human SOUL

 Room

 Dumb Parts

 Short Shelf Life Following Awards Season

 Normal is not so easy

 A dark, feel-good movie

 Emotion Carries This Drama

 Solidly Executed

 great film well thought out.

 Could have been a Spielberg...

 Room an emotional film

 The Little Boy Gives Fantastic Performance

 Good
