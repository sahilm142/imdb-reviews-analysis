I watched Tokyo story early this morning and I was, I think, receptive and sat in front of the screen with an open mind, not knowing what to expect from the(so I've been told)the great Japanese director.The film's print is not the best, and on reading the trivia for the movie, I understood why. There are older films with better visual quality(technically speaking), but the shots are imbued with imagination and restraint.I found my concentration wavering during the first half hour. Nothing seemed to be happening, and I was mentally scribbling a '5' for Tokyo story. But then my curiosity was piqued. I wanted to know what was going to happen to the main two characters. By the time the plot became evident I was hooked. The minutes passed quickly by, and at the end I was surprised that the film exceeded two hours.I was very satisfied with the way this film reveals itself without being too blatant. There is a certain honest subtlety about Tokyo Story that compels me to show respect for Ozu's effort. I am now eager to try more of his filmography. Not equal to Kurosawa's best but still a very good movie.
