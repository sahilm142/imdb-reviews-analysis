This is my first review on IMDb. I watched 100 episodes. 50 without drinking alcohol and 50 with drinking alcohol. Drinking did not ease the pain of watching this show. The reason I watched it was the high ranking on IMDb. And I must say I can't judge such calls by a single concrete formula and then criticize it. But one has to take into account what the makers of this show was trying to do with it, and then see why they did it. Having fun of everyone whose perspective subsists is based on success of reality shows, and so of course real reality shows are annoying! That's the point! A copy of fake reality shows. I will stick with "The Office" for now.
