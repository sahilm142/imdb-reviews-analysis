 Major problems with character development (spoilers)

 Worst possible

 Weakest of the Three

 "We Cannot Linger!" (-Legolas/Peter Jackson when wrighting the script)

 Can you say "Overkill?"

 doesn't belong in the top 250

 Simply ... awful

 Has Jackson actually read the books properly

 Shorter version of my review...

 Dreadful

 I think this is just an ordinary movie not a great movie

 Great views, few thoughts

 Dull, uninvolving, forgettable uncharismatic characters.

 Braindead

 Lord of the movie cliché

 Best of the 3, but still very average and way too long

 The "Return of my money" please!

 LOTR 3: The Video Game

 worst of the 3, and the stink of the first 2 rose pretty high

 boo

 Good special effects; mediocre story-telling

 Not Tolkien's Trilogy, not even the spirit of it. Worst of the three

 BETRAYAL

 how can THIS get 11 Oscars??

 Most overrated film in History
