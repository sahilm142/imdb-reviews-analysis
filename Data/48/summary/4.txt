 Falsification of history

 As much as I try, I don't get the appeal

 A Colossal Disappointment!

 The Fall of Rome (in movies)

 Historical? No. Epic? Sure.

 Ye gods! Spare me from a sequel....

 A decent B-grade Peplum turns into an overblown blockbuster.

 Great action and a great technical aspect, but I did not care for any of the characters

 a battle to get through

 Been there, done that.....better.

 Over rated Hollywood garbage.

 Yet another over-rated classic

 Biggest Disappointment EVER

 Have I seen this before?

 The most strong feelings: disbelief and frustration

 So many mistakes

 uninspiring story and characters, not saved by good cinematography

 A bit of a dog with some highlights

 Repetitious Crap.

 Disappointing

 What was this?

 The olde style before substance

 It was okay

 A phenomenal disappointment

 Period pieces can suck too?!?!?
