 Handsomely mounted and executed

 DOES NOT deserve such a high rating!!!!

 Not a typical Indian show

 Not as good as people hyped it

 Decent Watch

 Keep your hopes in control

 One of the best thing from the Indian cinema

 good ?? yes 100% .. but

 New dawn of Indian Television

 Poor sound

 A convoluted mess with brilliant performances

 Overrated

 Good But Not Great!

 Shows different than usual bollywood cinema, bold screenplay

 It's OK

 Overhyped and Well acted!

 Top-Notch acting and Script Flow but slightly overrated

 Bike Bollywood standards 25 out of 10.... Pilot episode Will hook you up

 gaitinde vs sulaiman

 UNPOPULAR OPINION : NOT AS GREAT AS EXPECTED
