 Season 2 is Torture Porn

 Doesn't really make sense and does drag on.

 A Religious Zombie Apocalypse

 Too much focus on giving a political message and less on story

 Lazy

 a mess

 Missing empathy

 Difficult to Connect with

 outrageous

 Overrated nonsense

 Incredibly shallow writing given how it pitches itself

 Exceeded my pessimistic expectations

 Crap

 Season 2 is the most horrible experience ever

 Season 2 has lost the plot - over indulging in low quality drawn out scenes

 Disappointment

 There is supposed 2b some inner logic. Alas...

 Too bad the only worthwhile part of this whole Series is the idea

 I Don't Get it

 Politically charged snooze-fest

 Boring and overrated

 Awful.

 Not for everyone.

 Male bashing at it's absolute BEST!

 Skimming down won't help
