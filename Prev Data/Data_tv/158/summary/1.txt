 Definitely beats its sequels

 I actually liked it after giving it a second chance.

 Dragonball matches up quite well with Z.

 It's a good show.

 The Right Mix of Action and Comedy.

 Superb!

 Good show, but read the Manga first

 Where it all started!

 The Greatest Anime ever!

 A great anime in my eyes

 Don't be fooled by the sequels!

 Dragonball

 This show was nostalgic

 My reaction to an incredible anime

 Awesome show

 As good as DBZ, if not better.

 Love you for these cartoons

 The Steven Segal of anime
