 Disappointing from start to finish

 ...does the show HAVE to go on?

 A night at the cinema? Save your money and have a night in with YouTube.

 Does not get the facts straight, Very disappointing!

 Terribly terrible.

 Not for me

 Weak

 Very weak

 A much needed release

 Face The Troof

 NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Meh

 Stone Cold Lazy

 The music is good, the movie not so much

 Music great - Movie very bad

 Sometimes Entertaining, Most Times a Trainwreck

 Not Good.

 overdramatized acting

 *Do you ever look at things and wonder how they got there?*

 A marshmallow sandwich between two slices of white bread

 The critics were right on this one

 Do not underestimate the spectators!

 Utterly baffling that this is on the award circuit

 fluff nonsense

 Lots of potential, majorly underdelivers.
