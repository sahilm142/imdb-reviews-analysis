 Long and sometimes hard to follow.

 Not bad

 The Seven Samurai

 Perfect ? No. Good ? Yes. (Spoilers)

 Quite good, but overrated

 Great directing does not make a great film

 Interesting but fails in a couple of crucial aspects

 This is a great movie?

 What's all the fuzz?

 partly touching

 Great stuff by often drags.

 running,screaming...yelling

 not so great samourai

 An important but overpraised film

 Not as good as...

 Interesting movie

 Long but good

 Kurosawa shows why he is such a revered director, but I expected a little more from the film.

 A fantastic movie, that has not aged that well in all regards

 A blueprint for greatness, but not astounding in itself.

 Effective drama about a group of professional fighters...

 What a truly great film, director inspired Clint Eastwood

 My rating: 7
