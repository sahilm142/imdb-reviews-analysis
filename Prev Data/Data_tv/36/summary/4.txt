 Hilarious, strange, funny, peculiar........

 Silliness to the extreme!

 A letter of complaint

 Monty Python's and their unique brand of humor

 even when you think you know all of what the show is about, a surprise comes round the bend

 The First 'Alternative Comedy' Show?

 How can anyone not like Monty Python?

 The Circus is On...

 A staged and carefully crafted presentation of absurdity and chaos

 Six intellectuals who revolutionized comedy with mostly weirdo characters

 Beating everything out of the meaninglessness of everything.

 Sometimes Very Funny But Could Also Be Very Bad

 pantomime horses

 High praise wouldn't do them justice

 Brilliant, innovative comedy

 Must-see

 "MONTY PYTHON" successful in the U.K.; but, "How well will it do in "The States"? They feared the worst, but well, we know now, don't we?

 Stop That Review, It's Getting Silly!

 Gumbys, Pepperpots, Pantomime Horses and Exploding Penguins!

 The Python Show, zany greatness.

 lemon curry?

 The Original Sketch Comedy!

 A Very Funny Classic
