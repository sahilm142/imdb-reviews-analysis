 Why we go the movies...

 Love Still Exists.

 A Perfect Chemistry, In One of the Most Beautiful Romances I Have Ever Seen

 one of my favorite movies

 Wonderful love story

 One of the best films of the 1990s

 EXTREMELY DEEP & WONDERFUL LOVE STORY !

 It makes you feel you are really alive.

 still cuts deep after 10 years

 Frame of Casablanca (1942)'s Love Story

 the kind of conversations we all have in reality, yet projected here in a purely cinematic fold

 Seen this many a time just to fall in love with it.

 How can any movie be THIS good?

 It may change your way of life.

 Simplicity at its elegant best

 Love.....Love your soul. Treat it to this film.
