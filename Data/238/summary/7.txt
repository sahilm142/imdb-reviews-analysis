 Probably one of the best sequels I have ever seen.

 Worthy second chapter. Will we see another in 9 years??

 Linklater Sharpens His Pencil

 Subtle and Heartbreaking

 We change as we grow older

 One of the most artistically romantic movies ever

 One of the best trilogies put on film's middle part.

 Vicki is not impressed

 "Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past."

 The Same Great Characters with a Not-So-Slight Hiccup

 Paris we love!

 Great acting and connection kept after so long after

 watch BEFORE SUNSET(s)...

 The Riveting Conversation Goes On and Grows Up

 Love story for anyone

 An impressive addition to Before Sunrise as Linklater proves once again that he has what it takes when a script is needed to carry a film.

 I Frankly Don't Understand All of the Fuss

 Charming but sophomoric

 Walking and Talking and Nothing More

 Great start - poor finish!

 An interesting romance film

 Not quite as good as I hoped for

 Retrospective conversation between former lovers

 Compelling and a great watch!

 love, where are you?
