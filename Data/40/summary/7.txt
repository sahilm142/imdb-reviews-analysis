 A well made film

 A fun film

 about bridging the differences, but in the easy register

 A feel-good Hollywood movie disguised as a french movie

 The type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman.

 A beautiful movie

 Actually interesting

 Great!

 Entertaining, optimistic without schmalz – shortage of drama though

 good humor is probably best remedy to difficult situations

 Good film

 great film

 Bypassing opposites

 Obvious yet inexplicably entertaining

 It makes me feel warm

 Paris in both ways

 Not a fairy tale

 Short Review

 A Touching, Sensitive, and Funny Film

 Surprise

 warm uplifting story of two different characters forging a friendship

 Pragmatic

 Feel-good at times but definitely overrated.

 They told me it was the best movie but...

 Nice I guess?
