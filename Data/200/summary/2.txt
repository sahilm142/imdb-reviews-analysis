 2 hours of sadism

 Total Disappointment overall

 I'll keep it short

 There are none so blind as those who will not see

 OK, I'll say it...

 Why Do We Watch Movies?

 Empty and hypocritical

 Would have left the movie theatre if I could have.

 12 years a slave is nothing special!!!

 black exploitation film

 And the award goes to...

 Disappointing

 Very boring, ignore the hype

 Boring,waste of excellent performances,Over rated

 Painful viewing for no reward

 where did this praise come from?

 Shock For The Sake Of Shock

 Slow, boring and too long

 Big budget bull****...

 Far too graphic for my liking

 2 hours of pointless and depressing oppression for what?

 Boring

 This was a big deal why?

 Been There, Done That Better

 Disappointed
