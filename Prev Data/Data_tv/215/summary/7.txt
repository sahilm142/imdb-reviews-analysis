 A disappointing yet enjoyable series so far

 Still ambivalent towards Korra

 A fine sequel series

 Second Review: Well... the series has spiraled down since Season 1...

 a good effort that ultimately falls short

 legend of Korra is a good effort but certainly not better than legend of Aang

 A Good Show; Too Soon to Tell Where it Will Lead

 So much promise, underwhelming execution

 An initially well-meaning, but ultimately misguided effort

 ... It's Okay...

 The Avatar is back!

 After 2 seasons still seems to be finding its stride

 The Non-Legend of Korra

 Korra is terrible at being the avatar

 An intelligent and captivating series that is not for children.

 Watch, enjoy and try not to think at Avatar (very minor spoilers)

 I think it deserves to be seen

 Good but still ..
