 slightly over rated, but great classic thriller

 Well made but yecch.

 A good piece of cinema, but seemingly overrated beyond oblivion.

 Inferior to "Se7en" but a good movie - just overrated!

 After Titanic, the most worthless Best Picture winner of the 1990s

 Not as good as people are saying it is.

 Coveted skins

 "I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti."- Hannibal Lecter

 Mysterious Skin

 good!

 Ultimately silly

 Anthony Hopkins at his finest

 A Classic

 I definitely enjoyed it, but did not love it

 One of the scariest movies of the past decade

 Some Careless Stitching

 Another proof that Anthony Hopkins is the best British actor of all time

 Surprisingly Effective Thriller

 Maybe I'll love it in few years

 Sometimes, you wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the lambs.

 I Know I'm Probably In The Minority

 Silence of the lambs

 Not Bad

 A bit lacking, don't know what the fuss is about

 Oscar Winner? Ha! Ha!
