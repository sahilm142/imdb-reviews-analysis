This series is interesting to view in terms of an insight into the Turkish way of life. The story lines are sometimes good and sometimes totally crazy. The characters are extremely well acted but at times annoying to watch which is what they are supposed to be and is a tribute to the professionalism of the actors. To complete the series is a marathon. Individual episodes are complete in themselves but there are several continuing story lines which attract you to the next episode to see what happens. What is fascinating is portrayal of the way policing operates in Turkish Muslem society and how citizens and police have to be wary of potentially corrupt entities within a highly authoritarian state. With potentially 150 hours of watching time I suspect not many people will make it to the end.
