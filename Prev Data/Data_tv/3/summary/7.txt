 Perhaps Not The Masterpiece It's Made Out To Be

 A mixed bag with great and weak bits.

 Very good if over-hyped series....

 I finally figured out my main criticism of BoB

 BAND OF BROTHERS (Various, 2001; TV) ***

 Realistic

 not bad

 Definitely watchable but not great

 Yep If u like this u probably might like the Bold and the Beautiful too
