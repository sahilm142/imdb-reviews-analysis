 Pixar rests on its laurels

 This movie is fairly weak, but okay

 Quite funny in parts, but the flying house turned out to be a pretty pointless idea

 Weakest of the Pixar films

 Not bad, but not great

 I'm a little confused and disappointed

 Very lackluster, rushed effort

 Why does everyone think this is so great? It's par with Pixar.

 Adult themes and PG rating (nothing is sacred)

 Yes, finally quite a failure for Pixar

 Up is Down

 Way too negative and sad

 It's a "guy movie" (says my wife)

 Way overrated

 Give me a break

 Out of balance.

 At times amusing-frankly rather odd...

 What has happened to classic cartoons like THE LION KING

 Sorry, didn't like it, even though animation great.

 Movies Suck: Pixar does it again, but I'm not sure it's a compliment anymore.

 Inappropriate for kids in my opinion

 Amazing Start then it goes down hill
