 The Moose Hole - Review of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

 How happy IS the blameless vestal's lot?

 Intriguing and Original Romance

 You can erase someone from your mind. Getting them out of your heart is another story

 Breaking up is (really) hard to do

 Unique and extremely well made

 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) - Don't Erase my Memory, Please!

 Entirely lovable film on entirely fascinating subjects, that still isn't perfect.

 To forget is not always the easiest solution

 One of the Best Love Stories Around

 Imaginative, unique love story

 A dark and thoughtful film about why people stay in toxic relationships disguised as a positive, romantic film about love

 If you think the title makes the movie sound penetrable, you have no idea.

 Third Time is a Charm

 Good narrator

 Are we happy, or do we only think we are?

 Shifting Inner Realities and True Love

 Unique

 When weird things feel natural

 That's not OVERRATED! OK?

 My favorite movie of the decade

 DEEP & HEARTBREAKING

 You belive in every wacky shenanigan.

 Bizarre, addictive, mind bending!

 One of the greatest
