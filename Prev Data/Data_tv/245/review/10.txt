After a while I have come across such a good Hindi show that imbibes humor, sarcasm and best of situational comedy. Best show on Indian TV after sarabhai vs sarabhai.. May be even better than that. The writing is so simple yet beautiful. The actors can act just apt and that is a perfect level... I love the character Mikesh. Do goody but extremely goofy.. And his GF's realism is so good for them.. And twists (which aren't really there) and kinks of the show are wonderful.I would like to commend the TVF team for such a wonderful show.. As it is their other work like TMO and Rowdies have ROFL me but this show is a class apart which is an amalgam of humor, sensitivity, love wala romance and most of all STORY


                
Permanent Roommates is the first drama series by "The Young Turks" of Indian television - The Viral Fever team. It is high quality (in story, acting, writing, direction), flawless, as well as fearless. Watching these non-existent actors perform with such originality, many of whom were engineering students just few years ago, in colleges we have all studied in - gives you some different kind of joy, mixed with pride.With this drama series, the writing on the wall has become clearer - "this is what we want"! TVF is an expression from the young Indians, who for years mourned the fall of television. Even though the mainstream is still pro-mass entertainment - the day is not far, when this expression will replace the mainstream. For many internet Indians, it is already doing so.


                
A wonderfully written, directed and acted romantic comedy that is truly unique and pleases immensely on many fronts and with many layers. It excellently blends emotion and humor to give an intriguing and fun insight into today's modern relationships. It definitely transcends the current Indian cinematic blunders in this genre. I look forward to their upcoming productions and I am confident the Team will grow from strength to strength in times to come. They deserve financial and distribution support to enter the big screen or perhaps even next-gen television. The world needs more visionaries like these. I am proud to see that Indian youth creators are taking the path less traveled and are venturing into exciting territory. Truly, content is king!


                
This show is made in India , by the Indians and for the Indians . Such proud of whole cast and crew and big thanks to TVF for making such efforts and to make such type of show which is like fresh breeze of air with no cliché anything at all.

Last thing amazing acting and amazing writing . Thumbs up guys. I can go on and on about this show..


                
We had great TV serials. We were on the right track. Malgudi Days, Byomkesh Bakshi, Office Office, Hum Paanch etc ( There are many). Everything was going great...until...until a lady infested our TV SERIALS. She is responsible for our brain damages..she is responsible for making us the "poor audiences". She gave us Kyoki saas Bi khabhi bahu thi, Kasooti, Kumkum etc etc. She invaded our minds...she spoiled our senses...That lady needs no introduction. Once Naseruddin Shah said, "I can never be part of fiction on TV firstly because it's too time consuming and brain damaging."TVF needs no introduction. They are the best. They neither run for TRP not Money. When they launched the teaser of Permanent Roommates, I was skeptical about it. To make a TV show, you need to think big; basically you need to be original. After watching the first episode I was awestruck ..It was unbelievable ..damn if I were a billionaire I would have launched a TV Channel for them. Everything was perfect. The humour, chemistry, bonding, sarcasm, emotions, background music, acting, direction, story and whatnot. This was something we deserved as an audience. Just completed the final episode...I think their work is impeccable..well, I would say 'trend-setter'. To achieve this level of emotions and sentiments is something difficult. What a heart warming episode they created. TVF TEAM YOU ROCK !! You make India pround...I can say with proud that we have our own sitcom..which is original...COOL !!1. -Party kidhar hai ?? -Party hum Kanha ladies bar mien de hee denge
Beautifully describe the actual relationship before n after marriage.must watch atleast once


                
I was in love with mickys cute character and each and every character in this web series has an important message to our society....


                
Just When I had given up on Indian Television, comes this amazing web series that marks the beginning of a new era in Indian television. Wonderful direction, Awesome screenplay and great acting, permanent roommates has it all. The plot is realistic with perfect dose of subtle comedy and strong emotions. the script is nothing short of brilliant. The way series builds up from first episode is phenomenal. The lead characters share a great chemistry and compliment each other really well. As Always Jeetu despite his short role takes the cake. Lleo with his "Jagah kaha hai" dialogue was brilliant as well.Overall a wonderful series filled with romance, comedy and drama.Can't wait for season 2


                
Amazing! Simple yet so nicely crafted story line. Not a single second of boredom. There have been instances of loud sexist jokes where as subtle humor was overly spread. Mickesh is such a naturally funny actor.He acted appropriately dumb in the season.Tanya's character was portrayed equally well. The supporting actors are equally worthy of the appreciation.Thoroughly enjoyed it. I have already been a huge fan of the "Novice broker" since the Roadies qtiyapa. This is a new genre of TV series and we can expect much more from other channels as well.Overall it was very refreshing and a total offset from the daily mundane drama. Kudos TVF!! Eagerly waiting for the 2nd season.


                
This show brought a smile on my face. The acting by the lead pair is so effortless .Sumeet Vyas has that quality in him that you instantly start liking him. His mannerisms, the way he talks and his dialogues have a lot of subdued humour. It is a fantastic leap in Indian television that has been cursed with Saas Bahu Sagas. The writing is witty. I hope they make more shows like this and they get released on Mainstream television. This is welcome to an Indian TV Enthusiast that keeps watching American Television and cannot find an Indian Equivalent


                
Permanent roommates is not overly emotional, not overly humorous and not even a overly love story and this is what it makes so special. Unlike "tune meri chai kaise pee" saas bahu crap; this is a middle class depiction of a love between a typical Indian IT professional and an independent girl who feels confused about her relationship. This is really fast paced drama and never kept you waiting for what next... director and script writer deserves a doff for it. Nidhi Singh and Sumeet Vyas both has gone deep inside their characters..This is 100% recommended to anyone who is bored with Netflix and has not watched star plus/colours from last ten years.


                
It was given to me by a friend of mine who follows the TVF's Youtube channel on a regular basis... At first I thought I didn't even have any idea that it is some online Serial I just kept watching the first one and when I finished I liked it that much that I instantly downloaded all remaining episodes! I am most hopeless guy and think after this much youth population of country we still can not write good Scripts and Say it movies or serials every place is Literally filled with lack of creativity among scriptwriter and thus leading to repetitive work... Permanent roommates brings a big hope. Extremely good writing, All Great Characters and i've literally fallen in love with this girl which I have already watched her in 'Every Delhi Girl Video', PUROSHOTTAM is Super awesome, Tanya's roommate and her bf are Great too... Top notch Sarcasm, 90s Culture, Practical Jokes, Mike's Sense of humor. In fact pretty awesome gags at every minute as the story continues. You'll start falling in love with all the characters!! If I would be a billionaire I would have made a Channel for TVF!! Watch this being an Indian it's not just some funny video it's Permanent Roommates!! I love it to the core...!!!


                
A cherishing experience; something India can be proud of. This is a quest of TVF for improving the standards of Indian Television which is certainly heading towards success. A big thumbs up to TVF. This show is only for those people who like to see something real and funny at the same time. You just need to give it a chance and it will not disappoint you, this is the best series that I have seen in Hindi language. I would like to request to all the readers that please see this show and it will be worth every second of your time. Without exaggerating I would like to say that this kind of shows are something that Indian audience is longing for.
Defying rules, norms, upheld values, TVF is running away with its glory. Soaring high into the free air, liberating from the worldly bounds and transcending precepts. Who says that the Indian audience is not ready, whether we are ready or not, I would like to believe that the decision should be left to us. I wish every Indian channel telecasted shows like Permanent Roommates, but if not all, someone can and someone should. A very well written, directed and executed show depicting the fears, anxieties, tenacious practices and fallible desire of reciprocity, everything that couples go through, presented in a manner that anyone can enjoy. This show is just the beginning of the revolution that blemish the set methods and establish an environment that provides subsistence to whimsical, organized and intelligent television.


                
Such a delight it is watching this show , writing is superb , acting is remarkable and there is sublimity in direction . there is hardly any emotion this show doesn't appeal to.


                
Its really a very nice show. one of the best series. i ever witnessed in my life. i can totally relate that story. its been really a nice journey TVF why dint u make a mode of that. it will be better then any Bollywood movie. it is so real. Mikesh is good I love Tanya . All the other carburetors are awesome.


                
This is really One of my favorite. I was eagerly waiting for each Episode of season 1. I simply love the way the actor & actress act.Specially the dialogue of that guy "cool Han cool" & "you are speaking too fast that, nothing is understandable" :-). This season having 5 Episode & each Episode is lengthier than it's previous one. You just going to wish that may the episode don't end.I really thank full to director who create such a nice story. Everyone should watch this Season.Now Eagerly waiting for Season 2.
