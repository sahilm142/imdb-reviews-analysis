 YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET

 Maybe I missed something, but I just was not impressed.

 very good movie, the first time around. Then . . . . .

 a classic wannabe, an intellectual flop

 An intermittently interesting failure

 Not For Me. I'll Stick with Pi

 Much ado about nothing

 I just couldn't buy into the feel of this film

 Work of art my a**.

 Over-hyped and Over-rated

 Pretentious

 Sweet Jesus

 Hahahahahaha.....Wahahahahaha.....Poo

 Not all it's hyped to be

 Brilliant film making for film makings sake! No entertainment

 draining and crappy!!!!!

 Dream Turns To Nightmare!

 John Waters eat your heart out

 Well I can't say I was disappointed

 Remake of Reefer Madness

 Probably too effective

 Perhaps I missed something?

 What are you people thinking, an 8.5?

 Absolutely predictable

 Lamest movie ever
