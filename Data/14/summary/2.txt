 Insulting

 Predictable, shallow and repetitive.

 Pretentious crowd pleaser

 Vacuous

 Most Overrated Movie of All time!! or Not Very Original

 Mind Boggling.

 Inception = deception by insipid reviewers

 Seriously?

 Mindless action film about the mind...

 The thinking person's movie<U+0085>For people not use to thinking

 Question

 It's a joke ...

 Mostly for Morons (or) Strictly for Stupid.

 Dreary, over-hyped nonsense aka : "Style Over Substance"

 Not a masterpiece

 I was glad the theatre served alcohol

 You can fool a lot of the people most of the time!

 Hollywood at its absolute WORST

 Best Nolan Flick Yet? Doubt it

 A smart movie for dumb people, a dumb movie for smart people

 Absolutely not impressed

 ROFL... hahahaha

 It doesn't work - period

 This film doesn't deserve all of the superlatives it gets!

 Deception?
