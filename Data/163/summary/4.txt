 Home Run? No, Just A Measly Single

 Beautifully Shot, Utter Trash

 A civilization gone with the wind...

 An Epic, Lushly Filmed Soap Opera is Still a Soap Opera

 One of the most overrated films of all time.

 its okay

 Big Deal

 Long on hype, short on believable performances

 Over-payed Over-praised Hype

 Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give A Damn

 I don't like GWTW but can appreciate it

 The reasons WHY this flick is worse than and MUST be outlawed like Kiddie Porn . . .
