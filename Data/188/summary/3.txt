 Trite

 What a waste of two and a half hours

 The pace slooooooow

 Nothing. Happens.

 Russian Philosophy not Science Fiction!

 boring movie

 Gloomy, depressing, and way overlong

 Weak, meandering religiosity - with some redeeming features.

 drip , drop...soooo sllloooowwwwww

 Can't recommend it

 A huge disappointment, as a book it could be great

 I'll take "Aliens" any day of the week over this. !!Spoilers!!

 Disappointing

 Slow and dated
