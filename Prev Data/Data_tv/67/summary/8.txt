 The season long stories ruined it.

 Losing its edge

 South Park

 one of the best shows until S20.

 truly genius

 A top quality comedy which keeps on giving!

 Very good satirical sitcom

 Very funny but very disgusting. can't stop laughing.

 Hilarious comedic satire.

 Maybe the most intelligent show on TV...

 Television Review: South Park Season 22

 Best Show on Comedy Central

 A sometimes to far out show but overall very funny

 Vulgarity necessary

 I like it. I'm into this kind of humour. But a few things seem to be over the top with the show.

 Crude, Lewd, Rude, but Enjoyable!
