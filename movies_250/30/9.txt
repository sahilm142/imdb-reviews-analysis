The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or " The Green Mile ", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****


                
Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.


                
Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so <U+0430>ttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud.


                
This movie is very moving. Great storyline, and extremely captivating. It definitely captures the emotions of the viewer.


                
"The Green Mile" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; "The Green Mile" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it."The Green Mile" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.*** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey) John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means "winged creature." Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse "Mr. Jingles." *** End SPOILER ALERT *** BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, "The Green Mile" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face.


                
I think I got the message of the film after about 45 minutes; that there is so much hatred and anger among people, and that revenge is nothing constructive. A very important message which I think the film delivers brilliantly, with John Coffey as a "triumphant card". The supernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus solely on them, but I think they're "metaphoring" and make things a bit more understandable, maybe. A wonderful movie that moves at a measured pace on to a very unexpected ending. As with most great movies the casting is almost perfect and each character gives added depth to a rich script. Tom Hanks gives another outstanding performance, his supporting actors (particularly David Morse)actually support and enhance his role. A really great story - not at all what I expected, but much more.


                
I promise you that if you have any humanity in your soul, by the end of watching this movie. You will find yourself weeping, because how moving this movie is. The Green Mile is an amazing movie directed by Frank Darabont who knows a little bit about directing prison movies. His biggest claim to fame was 1994's Shawshank Redemption, a prison movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. So it was no surprise that Frank and Stephen King would once again team up to bring audiences another great movie. Can lightning strike in the same place twice? Yes! Set in the Deep South rather than the north this time, Green Mile takes place in Louisiana's prison during the Great Depression. The film really captured the era. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard that works at a quarter of the prison whom job is to execute the inmates. The job is hard and tough. He became to question himself, and his job when a new inmate came named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a simple minded giant whom works more like a miracle worker than a murderer. I have to say what a great cast! Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was amazing. The way he can pull the audience in, with his delivery is just spell bounding. I got his 'broken glasses' and 'he kill them with they love' speech. I think this encompasses a major theme, how people are ugly and cruel to each other, and justice is only sometimes given. Everything about him, speaks John Coffey from the way he handle miracles, and even the child like innocents when playing with a pet mouse name Mr. Jingles. David Morse as Brutus "Brutal" Howell is a great supporting character that helps Paul with his job. I really liked his performance as the strong- will, second in command officer. Then there is Dough Hutchison as Percy Whetmore - he plays a great weasel. He captured Percy's cowardice, arrogance, and violence perfectly as the crudest of the guards. Last, worth noting is Sam Rockwell. He was a little older than how I imagined the criminal Wild Bill to be. He did bring some good humor to the film. I do find the moon pie scene hilarious. A lot of critics have panned the film for not having realistic characters. The characterizations on the death row inmates don't really seems like they belong there. Honestly, does anybody think Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) even commit a crime? He seems way too old to be really a murderer, even Arlan Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) didn't seem so bad. Then you got Percy, the immature sadistic, racist, creep, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. The characters were way too good or just plan evil with little to no character development. I think it's OK to have film like that, and how the characters were portrayed, I think it was very accurate to the book. In the book, I had a hard time telling the other guards Harry (Jeffery DeMunn) and Dean (Barry Pepper) apart, so I'm glad in the movie, Dean was considerably older than Harry. The biggest change from the book is the racism in the South. I honestly think they toned it down in the movie, the n-word is used plenty of times in the book. Another thing that the movie didn't put was the short story about old Paul in Georgia Pines with a cruel employee that reminded him of Percy. Adding this to the movie would have made it too long, it was already three hours, but it definitely gave his elderly age some more depth. The movie did add some new things to help the film. I think the repeated visual of the light bulbs bursting during Coffey's bursts of power added to the story since we couldn't get inside of Paul's head. I also thought Coffey showing Paul what he saw as opposed to Paul going to investigate was a good move for the film - it shortened the film that was needed badly. Another thing that angry some critics, was the "Christ" like symbolism with John Coffey. People says it was too much messianic overtones in the story but it's absolutely ludicrous. As a Christian man, I wasn't offended by it. People need to be open to all beliefs to get this film. Once you get pass that, you find John Coffey to be a very interesting lovable guy, and you get emotional invested in him to the point that you cry when you see what happen in the end with his character. Then there are those people that mad because the movie is way too long. Not that that is always bad, but it didn't help things at all here. If this movie had been the standard flick, but I will defend this movie because the Green Mile is supposed to seem too long. It was even quote in the film. Anybody who read the book, should have known that. The music by Thomas Newman is amazing. It fits in with the mood of the film. Even the song from 1935's Top Hat work in this film. Overall: I really enjoyed this movie. I can understand why it was nominated for a Best Picture at the Academy Awards. An amazing story. Sad emotional for sure, but a lot of great stories are. BTW- RIP Michael Clarke Duncan. You were a great actor.
The Green Mile is my favorite movie! It was a complete roller coaster ride of emotions that made me cry. The end was the saddest when Michael Clarke Duncan's character is put on the chair although we know he is innocent and it was the crazy man locked up. I also thought it was so sad when they were watching the last movie that the prisoner got to watch before he died, and then Tom Hanks's character started to cry! I also loved how even though the prisoner was huge, he had a heart of gold, and he actually appeared cute and innocent to me during the whole movie. The only con of the movie was it took me a little bit to understand the murder of the little kids that was committed by the insane man in the movie. I also loved when the old Tom Hanks showed the old lady that he was telling the story to the mouse that was still alive. The amazing thing was i had watched this movie right after seeing Forrest Gump and I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to take Tom Hanks seriously, but I could! It just proves how amazing an actor Tom Hanks is.
This film is one of the best films of all time, as it is completely unexpected and just outstanding. When I first watched this film I was never expecting one of the characters to have some kind of god given power, and even when I've now watched it a few times I still am left mesmerised every time it happens. The emotion in this film is one of its key parts, it utilises the idea of prison and especially death row, to show what people are really like even when they face 'the mile'.The acting is without parallel in this film with key appearances of Michael Clarke Duncan who plays John Coffey so, so well, he so amazingly simple yet so deep at the same time he is truly a gentle giant, and it is a pleasure to watch. Tom Hanks also plays the head guard of death row extremely well, as he really has all authority and its interesting to see how he plays the role when many others would have become corrupted in such a position. The rest of the inmates all have their own detailed stories, as well as the guards, there is so many different tones in this film. It can really be sen that every kind of person can relate to someone in this film, an thats what makes it so great.The use of the mouse is also something that must have been amazingly tedious to film but the responsiveness of the animal is something that is rarely seen in other films, so this is again something that makes this film amazing. The film is also long in terms of what we can normally expect for film length, but you don't notice it, I felt it could have gone on for many more hours and I would have enjoyed every minute of it. The complexity of the relationships between guards and prisoners is also something that perfectly portrayed in this film, the idea that we are all humbled with this idea of our final mile, of what ever it may be for each person. Which leads to my next point about the meaning of this film, that there is so much hatred in this world, even though the characters had done bad things, there was only really one of them who was a truly bad person all the rest were humbled, and it was disgusting to see audiences to the executions cheering for revenge. A lot of this film also was in what was not said and mere looks of trust were enough to reassure the audience so that we believed the story even though ti is obviously fantasy, but it is made so believable by these connections and outstanding acting.This film is one of the best films of all time, and should definitely be watched by anyone, more than anything, to make them feel humbled that someone so pure and so good could be killed for something they didn't do, its portrayed so well - definitely a filming great and a classic.
My Plot Summary:The Green Mile, set in the 1930s, is about the mental and physical health effects of working on death row. In this film the guards encounter many different men that have been put to death for various crimes. It isn't until they come across a black gentleman that has been falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls, that they begin to really have second thoughts about execution. This inmate has the magnificent gift of healing through his faith. A mix of the inmate's gift, and the fact that he is innocent, causes the guards to question whether or not this man should be executed. The situations a person encounters in their profession can affect them for the rest of their lives. Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the supervisor on death row, a dimly lit, dungeon-like building. Edgecomb has suffered major effects from the many executions that he has taken part in. He encounters a once in a lifetime experience when John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is sent to the Green Mile to await his execution. John Coffey is a very large and intimidating man that is extremely soft at heart. All this man wants is peace in his life from all of the hurt that is going on in the world around him. He has been blessed with the gift of healing. While he tries to help all he can he learns that it is impossible to help everyone. Paul Edgecomb's fellow prison guards are of varying personalities. Brutus Howell, played by David Morse, is a large man who has been given the nickname "Brutal" due to his size. In spite of the fact that he is a tall man, and somewhat intimidating, he is a kind man that comes to second guess the ruling for the execution of John Coffey. Percy Wetmore, played by Doug Hutchison, is an all around jerk who is all bark and no bite. This is proved when one of the more violent inmates grabs hold of one of his co-workers while he stands there shaking in his boots. Percy's interaction with the inmates causes John Coffey to dislike him. As a result, John Coffey has decided to "infect" Percy with an ailment that he cured a person of. Percy lashes out on another inmate, kills him, and then releases his "infection." Percy, in the end, ends up going to a mental hospital.My Review:The Green Mile, starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, and Michael Clarke Duncan, is a brilliantly written and produced piece of work. The choice of actors and actresses along with their exquisite performances could not have been better. The lighting and angles made the viewing of the movie a one of a kind experience. The artistic dimness of the lights, and dull colors within the walls of the Green Mile made this film all the more believable. It gives the viewers the sense of doom and dread that is felt by the inmates knowing that their lives are soon coming to an end because of the crimes they have committed. John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, delivered the most convincing, amazing, and overall ground breaking performance in this film. In spite of his extra large stature, Coffey is a kind, soft hearted man who brings a lot of heart-felt emotion to the Green Mile. The attachment that the guards develop to Coffey makes it extremely hard for them to carry out his execution; there was not a dry eye amongst the guards. This film shows that any situation that is encountered in a person's profession, whether it is mental or physical, can affect them for the remainder of their lives. These men face the biggest moral obstacle they will ever come across in their lifetimes. When asked by Paul Edgecomb how he is to answer for the execution of John Coffey, he is assured by the large, gifted inmate that it is OK to execute him, that it will end his pain and he wants it to be carried out. All he wants is to end the feelings he has every day because of all of the violence and hurt in the world around him. This film is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. There was laughter, tears, and amazement throughout the entirety of this film. The performance of the cast of The Green Mile was above and beyond my expectations of a film that deals with a prison setting. Tom Hanks, along with the many other actors and actresses will leave you begging for more. If you have not seen this brilliant piece of work, then it should be added to your list of must see movies for the year because it is guaranteed to please! If you liked Shawshank Redemption you will love this.


                
It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. "The Green Mile" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. "The Green Mile" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. "The Green Mile" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from "American Beauty" in the best performance of 1999.


                
The Green Mile contains the best ensemble of actors.  In any film with Hanks it would be easy to lose the other actors in such a huge shadow, but everyone shines with equal brilliance.  All the characters are believable. The script is absolutely amazing and spreads the mezmerizing dialogue around very democratically.  Also, that mouse deserves some kudos for performing so well.  The Green Mile is the best movie I have seen this year, and while sitting for three hours seems to be an awfully large commitment on behalf of the viewer, not a minute of it is ill-spent.


                
Prison drama + fantasy. I didn't see that coming. It brought emotion into the picture. Some would need tissue box because it's wild till the end.
Well done. A story of life, love, loss and loyalty. A moving example of how anyone can change with more acceptance and less judgement. One of the greats.


                
This great Tom Hanks film will make you cry for sure! Acting was on point. Michael Clarke Duncan- just wow. A very poignant film


                
You will cry, or at least get feel as for some characters in the movie. Especially the Electric chair scene is so terrible that you will get so angry towards the negative character. Only handful of cast is present in the movie. Still they play their roles nicely. You will love this movie for sure.


                
From the cinematography, to the directing and the acting, "The Green Mile" has been forever a staple on my list of 'All Time Classics'. And I must also add that it is as good as the book. May his soul rest in eternal peace; Michael Clarke Duncan gave an authentically genuine and phenomenal performance - the casting for this film was spot on and contributed in whole to the well-development of telling this story.A film I believe will continue to stand the test of time and remain one of the greatest films.


                
A movie with such brilliant casting and sensitive characterisation loved it


                
This is a good film, primarily because of Tom Hanks' subtle ability to portray a man who is tough, hard, and duty conscious, and at the same time compassionate and human. This character reminded me of Hanks' portrayal of Capt. Miller in Saving Private Ryan. A few scenes are grisly, but the tone of the film is generally positive, and several scenes are surprisingly moving. The supernatural powers of one character stood out strangely in a film that otherwise seemed to be dedicated to harsh reality, but I suspect that was intentional, for contrast, and it worked.One detraction was that I had a nagging suspicion that Hollywood was once again taking an opportunity to promote it's sociopolitical views, on capital punishment, race, and regionalism, but maybe I have become over-sensitive to this issue. At least they did not bash Richard Nixon, but then, it was set in the 1930's.Compared to American Beauty, this was a better film. I gave it a 9 out of 10.


                
Stephen King knows how to spin a yarn.  This is another terrific adaptation of a King novel that delivers a bittersweet story of a depression era Louisiana prison on the death row cell block.  It presents numerous interesting character studies that induce strong emotions for the various characters.  There is also a lot of irony here with good guys who are evil and bad guys who are good.Director Frank Darabont, who missed out on an Oscar with <U+0091>Shawshank Redemption' (also by Stephen King) to <U+0091>Forrest Gump' must have decided he wasn't going to beaten by Tom Hanks again and secured him for this film with wonderful results.  Unfortunately, he was trumped at the Academy by Kevin Spacey and <U+0091>American Beauty', an injustice in my opinion.Darabont again does a superlative job of creating the right mix of drama, imagery and human interest.   My only criticism of his direction is that the film was much too long.  It certainly could have been done in two hours instead of three with very little lost in the editing.  We could have eliminated the entire first execution and rehearsal without any loss to the story except perhaps the sponge issue.The acting was outstanding by all.  Tom Hanks turns in another great performance as the tough but kind cell block boss.  Hanks continues to show his versatility, excelling in both dramatic and comedic roles and moving effortlessly between them like a chameleon.  David Morse mirrored Hanks as another tough guy with a heart and played the part nicely.  Michael Clarke Duncan engendered a very sensitive and lovable nature to his character, making the contrast between his demeanor and physiognomy all the more striking.  And I cannot leave out the uncredited star of the show, the little mouse who played Jangles.Overall, a well crafted film and an excellent story that suffered slightly from excessive length.  I rated it a 9/10.  I would recommend it highly to anyone except those who are squeamish about graphic violence (such as the electrocution scenes).


                
The Green Mile made me think about very real things in lifealthough its story goes into the realm of fantasy. What thismovie succeeds in is to make the fantasy work for the questionsit is posing. What makes this movie great is that it involvesyou with its story and leaves you with a lot to think about...this makes a good m


                
I was not surprised from what to expect from this movie.Having  seen Darabont again,i new the result would accomplish my expectations.The film was tender full of hidden messages and all the actors have given the best abilities to the roles.The biggest surprise was Michael Duncan's role as John Coffey, and i think he deserves the second role academy award this year.As for Mr Tom Hanks, the only comment is that all his latest works have all won an Oscar nomination! Go see the movie.It will speak to your heart,and make you understand the magic of acting and creating characters. Movie is not just about directing and creating effects all the time.Acting is having the most significant part and this movie is a total pleasure!


                
Used the same idea as in Ellen Burstin's Resurrection, i.e. someone with the power to cure.  Both movies had imaginative endings that were highly satisfying both emotionally and intellectually.   Resurrection has the best ending to any movie I have ever seen so Green Mile is in good company


                
The Green Mile was a very good movie. It seemed more of a Stephen King story than The Shawshank Redemption because of all of the magic and supernatural powers it had in it. Don't walk into this movie expecting to see a regular prison movie. That's The Shawshank Redemption. This is a spiritual fable that has 3 different stories in it..they are the following:1.) An innocent 7ft. tall black man on death row with magical healing powers. 2.) 4 kind prison guards and 1 sadistic one. 3.) 2 other unique prisoners: a man who grows to love and care for a wild mouse and a crazy, violent man named Billy The Kid.You wonder at first why are there so many different stories but it all fits together at the end. It has a happy ending to it. So happy that I cried tears of joy. While Shawshank was great from beginning to end, Green Mile starts to get good after the first half hour. Good movie, worth a watch, but still not as good as Shawshank. Not by a long shot.


                
As I reflect on the film, I keep coming back to one basic thought. It is the thought that struck me about 20 minutes in: This is a film that has been perfectly cast.It has been four days since I last saw Darabont and Tattersall's The Green Mile and it still hasn't quite all sunk in. I had read Stephen King's serials while recovering from back surgery. The week before surgery, my girlfriend told me that the people who made Shawshank Redemption were adapting another King story and that it would star Tom Hanks and that big guy from Armageddon. So, finding myself confined to my bed, I started reading. I was finished within a day.I like delude myself a little. I like to think I know a few things about film and I could be a director, you know? When I read good stories, I like to picture which actors would be good for which parts. It was the casting of James Cromwell as The Warden that iced the cake for me. That was one I didn't expect. I thought he would be playing Irish Police Chiefs until he keeled over. Not that playing a southern Prison Warden is casting against type exactly, but he still puts in a nice performance. As does everyone in the film. This must have been a fun film to make.The only thing that I didn't like about the film was that it explained too much to the audience. So much can be said with just shot sequence and gesture. Sometimes dialogue gets in the way of things that can't be communicated with speech.Still, I cried like Nancy Karrigan.


                
The movie I've waited all year to see.  It was worth it, as the screen vividly brought to life Stephen King's endearing and memorable characters.The Green Mile is a faithful adaptation of the serial novel.  It moved right along and completely held my interest even though it's 3 hours long. Actually, it could even stand to be a bit longer and go into more detail about the condemned inmates themselves and Paul Edgecombe's investigation into Coffey's defense (or lack thereof).Brilliant performances by Hanks and Duncan.  I was especially wowed by Sam Rockwell's intensity as "Wild Bill".  The only flaw was not enough Gary Sinise!I can't wait for it to come out on DVD (perhaps in an expanded Director's Cut), but meanwhile I may have to see it a couple more times in the theater.
