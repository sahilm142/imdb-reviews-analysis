STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The group enter the next decade, with some of their heavy personal baggage from before settled, and some of it still lingering in the air. Lorraine (Vicky McClure) has a devastating revelation to offload to younger sibling Kelly (Chanel Cresswell), and the impending release of Combo (Stephen Graham) from prison, after serving time on her behalf, sets the wheels in motion for a terrifying confrontation with Milky (Andrew Shim), a ghost from his past, which will have devastating consequences.Some things can linger in the air long enough to just be permanently consigned to the rumour bin, and some do eventually come round. Four years after the antics of the TIE gang were last seen in Christmas 2011, we catch up with them at the start of the new decade, and it is with a mixed feeling of eagerness, but also a sense of aloofness that maybe it's dragged on a little too long, and the characters and their motivations are maybe becoming a bit too laboured now, and that this really ought to be the last part. While this is sort of true, the high quality of the production, and the brilliant delivery of it all manage to overshadow this.It all manages the rather odd task of being predictable and not predictable at the same time. While it doesn't require that much brain power to work out what is likely to happen, somehow how it's going to happen and in what manner keeps your attention and doesn't let go. The powerful, unflinching writing and superior performances make this a top quality treat. As the most high profile performer in the cast, and playing the character whose return ignites the fireworks in the script, Stephen Graham commands centre attention, playing a reformed character eager to put the terrible mistakes of his past behind him and make amends with those he's wronged, but whose past is on a collision course to snatch it all away from him in the most devastating way.It really ought to wrap it up here, though as ever it finishes with unresolved issues, and the number one rule is never say never. Hopefully, Shane Meadows will make the right judgement and not allow this fine series to become tainted. ****


                
We have watched Lol, Woody, Combo Milky, Shaun, Trev, Kelly and co grow up over the last seven years. We've seen them go through everything ranging from hilarity to upset to complete devastation, and it's all been executed brilliantly by Meadows and his cast of believable characters, just as perfect as they are rough around the edges.While this series presented us with some surreal moments of improvised comedy and a few baffling under-developed characters (namely Harrison, Jennifer, Woody's parents, the man in the cupboard, Flip and Higgy) it has brought us an emotional ending to a series with a cast that feel more like friends than fiction.Will there be another series? Who knows. Meadows has left himself enough open ended plot lines to revisit the gang as they discover Oasis and Blur, but it seems that it may have just about run its course. RIP Combo (maybe).In a drama as realistic as this there's never going to be a satisfying conclusion because, to us, they are real people with ever evolving lives and ongoing issues that don't just come to a satisfying ending. This isn't Hollywood. This Is England.
Shane Meadows and Jack Thorne have created a fantastic piece of television. The thing that makes This is England great is the realness and tension that the show creates. With some of the finest British actors to date, the whole of the 'This is England' franchise is a must watch.This is England '90 follows on from the Bafta winning This is England '86 and This is England '88. 90' focuses around the younger members of the gang as they are introduced to the rave scene and the nightlife of drugs, hit hard with Stone Roses and The happy Mondays. Over four seasons, starting from Spring, and ending in a bleak winter, This is England '90 really captures the essence of the beginning of a new generation...
