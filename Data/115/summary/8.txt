 Fabrications

 "Too bad, we're gonna miss the third act. They're gonna play it offstage."

 Full of witty banter and clever quips

 Still going strong!

 Great Movie

 Sometimes very very good is better than perfect

 This is what happens when you sell your soul to the devil.

 All About Eve

 More good acting at Hollywood Parties than On the Screen!

 Opens the curtain on backstage.

 A classic, but shouldn't have won best picture that year

 All about Bette.............and Eve too.

 excellent work

 Well done and worth the effort.

 wonderfully done, if too thin somehow

 Excellent Movie, Though Perhaps Over-Rated

 Jon Monsarrat review: still excellent

 All About Eve Is All About Women In Show Business & Their Men!

 Not "The Lady Eve"...

 Good period piece

 A True Classic

 I haven't seen a canny girl more than Eve

 Paranoid cynicism damages an otherwise masterpiece

 A Hollywood classic that has held up well

 The good, the bad and the ugly concerning "All About Eve."
