Amazing shots and facts, David is great narrator, but I found loud cheesy music very annoying at times and distracting me often, and along with too few killing censored, it sometimes felt like show for ADD kids. I think shows like this don't need that much music, if any, and should show more actual gore and violence to make people realize that it really happens in nature, so some ignorant idiots open their minds.
Otherwise amazing.Great document, amazing narration, but IMO too much loud, cheesy music and censor.


                
The cheesy fake soundtrack effects almost ruins this otherwise excellent documentary.If this show (minus soundtrack effects) was a tasteful Victorian dinning room with a single fresh flower on the table. The soundtrack effects are equal to a bunch of fake plastic flowers all over the place turning an otherwise tasteful Victorian dinning room into a very cheesy environment.A shame this show could have been a 10
