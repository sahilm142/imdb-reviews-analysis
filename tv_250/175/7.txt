I didn't really get into this version of Whose Line Is It Anyway nor have I seen the other 2 versions. I found some games really funny while others not so much. But I am going to give it credit for being entirely improvised.The premise is simple, take four comedians, from what I've seen three regulars and one guest and have them go through these games where they have to improvise both jokes, songs and sometimes satire on things like movie scenes. The points they are given are completely irrelevant and they're all just there to have a good time.Now I am giving this show and the people on it a lot of credit, the ability to improvise all this stuff and still make it both entertaining and work is just incredible. Even when I think "I don't find that particularly funny" I can still give it credit for trying.If there is a complaint it would have to be that I have seen about 6 episodes so far (I feel based on that it's enough for a review) and my favourite games include 2 of them improvising a scene from a Film-Noir but set in a lingerie shop, that was hilarious and the other one is where someone has to improvise a news story on a green screen yet not knowing a single thing about it. Those were hilarious but I have only seen that (or anything close) once. They were much better than what else I saw, but again I'm giving it credit.So if you have a half hour to just sit and watch something then this is perfect. I'm sure not everybody will like the humour that the show has and maybe a few of the jokes just might not do it for you, but again - These guys deserve some credit for improvising the whole thing.
