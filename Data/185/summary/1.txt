 Dumb college kid travels around but ultimately bites off more than he can chew.

 Its a shame is's a totally inaccurate movie...

 Dumb and futile death by misadventure by a spoiled rich kid

 Arrogant, selfish, myopic and stubborn.

 Laughably bad

 What an idiot!

 One of the most tedious movies I've seen in the theater

 Completely undeserving of a high IMDb score

 Give me a break!

 Pretentious, saccharine, over-blown nonsense

 2:20 Music Video

 Good movie about an idiot.

 Unbelievable and shallow as all hell!!

 90 year old man, what do you know about life!

 Horrible movie. Boring. I walked out.

 Complete waste of time

 Oh no he didn't!

 Should have taken the cruise

 Never has a piece of footage inspired more rage in me.

 If you enjoy boredom, this one's for you.....

 ignorance has its own rewards

 Worst Movie With the Best Soundtrack

 If this is finding freedom in the wilderness please take me home!!

 Penn takes tedium, predictability, cheese, and rhetoric to new heights

 Terrible, slow, lame. And also not good.
