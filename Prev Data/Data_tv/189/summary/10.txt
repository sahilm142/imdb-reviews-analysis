 Great entertainment that deserves to be judged by its own merits

 Endeavour Magic

 Best Ever!

 The last TV show worth watching

 A show that proves TV dramas can beat movies any day.

 Every episode an evening well spend.

 Liked Morse but I really love Endeavour.

 Initial fears blown away

 Best detective series

 An intriguing and engaging period piece of detective fiction

 No spoiler here, just an encouragement to embrace "Endeavour"

 If there were 11 stars, I would rate them

 One of the best shows on the air

 What more can you ask for?

 Brilliant series in its own right as well as being a truly worthwhile prequel for Morse

 ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT BRITISH DRAMA

 My Favorite Year,At Least So Far

 Best detective show ever!

 Great entertainment.

 I want some more

 Detective TV at its very best
