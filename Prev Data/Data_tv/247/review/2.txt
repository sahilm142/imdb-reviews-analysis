I must say, Naruto: Shippuden is not up-to the mark as Naruto. Naruto along with Sakura, have been given a lot overloaded powers..even greater than their own sensai or experienced Ninjas. How can it be possible that in 2.5 yrs. only Naruto and Sakura got upgraded while others didn't. 2ndly, the thing I hate the most. The arrogance and overconfidence of characters. Naruto was first stubborn n determined. But this time, he is arrogant. And this leads to downfall of series, at least in my eyes.Again saying the same thing, directors, producers and writers should KNOW how to evenly distribute the role of characters. I really admired Naruto(10 stars), but.....this show is not even near to its greatness.:-}
