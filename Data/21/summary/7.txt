 Unmoved (some small spoilers)

 Excellent and violent film based on real events

 Not nearly as good as advertised...

 good film, but waaaaay overrated

 Stunning gangster movie

 Good, but underwhelming

 City of Bad

 Extremely hard to watch emotionally.

 City of God or City of Evil?

 Real on a Historical Level

 #20? I don't know about that.

 City of God- SPOILER ALERT

 A timely piece on gun violence and children, but still missing some pieces.

 Rio de Janeiro in a new light

 This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow

 violence begets violence

 interesting

 Powerful, this movie represents harsh realities.

 Effectively brutal

 Good but long

 Believable and welcome South American life-in-the-ghetto diary, but ultimately too character cluttered, repeating and limited.

 Another foreign tragedy

 Talk about overkill!

 don't move there thats what i got out of it

 a shallow story, all be it a well told one
