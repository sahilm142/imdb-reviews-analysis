(major spoilers - plus, if you're a fan of the film, you won't like my review)I've never understood the fuss made over this movie - every time its been on TV i've watched the first five minutes, and rolled my eyes for various reasons (the first time it was Gabriel Byrne's accent, the other times it was how over-wrought everything was) and put something good on instead.I've finally given it the light of day tonight, to the end, and my feeling is this: one minute of cleverness at the end does not justify putting us through two hours of over-wrought actors playing at cops and robbers.The general situation is so very familiar - the crims who get together for one last job that goes wrong, and the way its told is not fresh either: the structure of the framing narrative in the present day and the flashbacks which take us back to a past event we want to learn the truth about, comes from Citizen Kane and Rashomon (ie, on its own does not make this movie original). The constant promise of a final mystery, which is intended to propel us to the end was invented by Orson Welles, and is a device used quite frequently (Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Go, Memento, The Exterminating Angel, and most movies, in fact).For two hours this is a lot of posing, actors dressed in "slumming-it" costumes straight from the costume designer's wardrobe, cliche dialogue, unbelievable situations, one unsustainable haircut, stubble and a lot of brooding "i'm a criminal" close-ups.There is a justified reason for all this falseness (aka pretentiousness), given in the final two minutes, which i can't even bring myself to say in case you haven't seen it and are still reading - i've had too many movies ruined for me. Save to say, like The Sixth Sense, this movie is a one-gimmick movie, and it takes watching it for two hours to find out that gimmick (which is the only possible explanation for characters having what i like to call Stephen King names, by which i mean they sound like someone has sat down and thought "What's a really cool name i can make up?" instead of names real people would have. Or possibly "what's the wackiest name i can give a person and have the audience not laugh" - if this was the case, they failed with me. Every time someone said "Verbal Kint," "Kobayashi," or "Kaiser Sosay" i couldn't help giggling) - i spent two hours rolling my eyes and two minutes saying "yes, that's clever, but if people didn't equate twists with quality then i could have enjoyed the entire two hours - but it would not have been this movie, which is nothing without its gimmick. I had the same problem with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - i need more than one gimmick to keep me interested.
I love movies with big twist ending. I love movies that play with your mind and leave you completely confused until the very end where everything finally makes sense.So I should like 'The Usual Suspects', right? Let's see: Confusing plot? Check. Big twist? Check. Point of the whole movie? NONE.This movie attempts to be clever by blatantly treating you, the audience, as an idiot. I pushed through this boring, big mess of a movie expecting a huge final revelation that would put all the puzzles pieces together. In the end, the movie throws all the puzzle pieces into the fire and laughs at you.*****SPOILERS***** (but really, don't bother watching, just read)What makes a good mystery thriller movie? CLUES! You are supposed to leave clues for the audiences to pick up so that when they watch the movie for a second time, they can bang their heads and say "Why didn't I notice that the first time?" In this movie, there is NO CLUE at all. Keyser Soze could have been ANYONE of the characters. The audience could never really know who is Keyser because the whole time we are forced to watch the movie from Verbal's own flawed and purposely misguided perspective! The 'twist' is one big joke. So Verbal is lying all the time? That's a twist? You dare to call that a twist? How brilliant! I could have never see that coming!! No, really. You could have never see it coming because there is literally NO WAY for you to see it coming; nothing is revealed until the movie almost ended. The only way you could have guessed is because, you know, "the weakest, least suspicious man is probably the killer!" What a cliché. The ending basically makes the rest of the movie completely pointless, and gives no reason for me to re-watch the movie again, because it would be like listening to a liar tell a story all over again.The plot is another one big problem. The entire first hour of the movie could have been scrapped off and still makes the movie a coherent story. All the useless, boring dialogues, all the random robberies and gun shooting, did absolutely NOTHING to advance the main story or develop any of the character. Nothing relevant actually happens until the part where Kobayashi popped up and revealed the main plot about Keyser Soze and the boat hijacking. So, bad twist ending aside, the plot doesn't do the movie any justice either.The acting? Nothing amazing. What Verbal does in nearly the whole movie is limp and talk, talk, talk while giving a straight and near- emotionless face. Casting any middle-aged balding actor as Verbal would have achieved the same effect. I can't say Spacey is a bad actor because I don't think he is, but his performance as Verbal is certainly not Oscar-worthy. *****END SPOILER*****I understand that movie ratings are subjected to personal tastes and perceptions. I can understand why so many people like movies such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Reservoir Dogs' even though I find them highly overrated. But I simply cannot accept that a movie like 'The Usual Suspects' is hailed as "the greatest twist movie ever" even after 20 years, when there are so many better ones like 'The Sixth Sense', 'Memento', 'Fight Club', or the highly underrated 'Identity'.Spend your two hours wisely. On anything. Just not on this movie.
I was deeply disappointed by this movie. The alleged and hyped twist ending could not have been more predictable. As soon as the mystery character was introduced, I suspected who it would be. As the story unfolded, it was clearer and clearer that it could be only one person. In a bit of Sherlock Holmes logic, all the other options were eliminated and the final remaining choice had to be the correct choice.We know from early on that the narrating character survives the opening sequence unscathed. That alone was a huge signal which spoils any chance of a surprise. The narrating character is revealed to be an excellent story teller, to be manipulative, cunning, and incapable of being truly frightened. Those are exactly the characteristics of the mystery character. Again, this made the ending obvious.That the story is filled with 90% false information is disappointing. It's a fundamental violation of the compact between the storyteller and the audience. Perhaps if the twist were not so clearly communicated from the beginning, perhaps if there really was some thought required in getting to the ending, then perhaps it might have some shred of justification. Only perhaps, though -- In the end, almost certainly not.
This review contains mild spoilers so don't read it if you haven't seen the flick.I hate these movies that just go and tack on this ending that no one could have predicted and it's supposed to be witty.  It's stuff like Urban Legends and Scream where the killer is the last person you'd suspect because the reason behind it is retarded and mostly based on information that you don't have.  Worse than that is stuff like Clue where there are a bunch of possible different endings to the movie that all work so that there's really no way to predict the ending.This movie was even more idiotic than those because not only is there no certain way to come to the logical conclusion given the clues but the whole story we're presented with is a string of lies.  Oh wow shocker!  Well of course it's a shocker!  It's like you hear the story of little red riding hood and then at the end your grandmother who's telling it to you says "You know what?  I was that little girl and there was no wolf after all.  I drugged my granny and stole all her cash then blamed it on the wolf." Holy crap!  I could never have predicted that!So this movie is worse than the farces that are Urban Legends, Scream, Clue and a majority of all the other movies that have ever been made.How this guy also did the brilliant movie that is X-Men is a mystery to me.1/10 and that's only because the scale doesn't have a zero
I wanted to like this movie but...**SPOILER**The movie lies to you.  In %99.99 percent of all movies, what you see on the screen is supposed to be what happened to the characters.  The only difference are things like point of view or missing details, for example you might know what happened from 3:00 to 4:00 and from 5:00 to 6:00 but not from 4:00 to 5:00.  Or you might know that Mr. A was there killing Mr.B but it's not until later you find that Mr.C was also there.In this movie though, several of the scenes are deliberate lies.  That breaks one of the cardinal rules of movie making.  Not that there are any rules but if the camera lies then there's basically no point in watching.It would have been a good movie for me, even with the twist, if all the scenes had been about reality and the twist brought all your missing knowledge together.  Instead, the twist just invalidated everything before it.  You end up not knowing if any scene in the entire movie has anything to do with reality whatsoever.Given that I honestly don't understand why people like this movie.  Try Memento, it doesn't lie.  Try Fight Club,  Try 6th Sense.  All much better movies because they are not full of camera lies.**END SPOILER**
I gave this movie a 1. Ignore the plot, there is none. The only spoiler is: The whole move is the invention of Verbal/Keyser who is trying to confuse the cop he is telling the story to...and us the audience. It appears that the movie was intended to have a twist ending, but at about 1/3rd of the way through the movie the director gave up trying to be coherent and just went with confusing. The ending that 'ties it all together' is that...well, none of it was true.Anyway, if you think that finding out at the end of the movie that pretty much everything you were shown was a lie makes for a good twist, you may like this movie. You will not understand it, because there is nothing to understand. At the end, all of the plot points were a made-up story, so what was the point? It is like watching 90 minutes of one movie and then watching the last 10 minutes of another movie. In short, this is really a waste of time.
*** CONTAINS SPOILERS ***Many movies have twists in their plot. Some of these movies leave you bewildered, the others just leave a bitter taste in your mouth.80% of this movie is based on Kint's narrative, and because of that, the narrative BECOMES the whole movie experience. I do not think it is clever or fair to end the movie by saying, "haha, just kidding. the whole movie is just a lie."Some people think that Kint's narrative was true, he just obfuscated the names. IMHO, I don't think that would redeem the movie. If it's a good mind-twister, which it's supposed to be, the audience would say, "so he is Kaiser Soze, yes, thinking back, it was obvious." But no, any of those five suspects could have been Kaiser Soze, the hints were not obvious nor subtle. I felt that the screen wright randomly chose one of the suspects to be Kaiser Soze at the end.Don't take me wrong, I think both the direction and acting are decent in this movie, but I cannot agree that the plot is anything special. In fact, except the big twist in the end, there is nothing exciting about it. To exaggerate it a little, the plot can be described as a glorified version of "Scream."
A crime thriller that isn't about redemption or revenge or much anything at all, "Suspects" isn't a movie as much as a display of a director's obsessive lust for the criminal underworld. Director Bryan Singer likes rain soaked gutters, burning cigarettes, crooked cops, clever retorts, smoky pool halls and menacing tough guys. Characters don't populate this movie. Attitude does. The movie isn't interested in where these guys came from, what motivates them, what their struggles are. Without struggle, there's no tension; without tension, there's no suspense; and a crime thriller without suspense exists only to covet the unpleasant, the nasty.With a quick pace, flamboyant cinematography, and lines like, "brought in on trumped up charges to be leaned on by half-wits", the movie insists that it's crafty and clever, but fails with characters who can't come alive beyond brief sketches. Hockney is a surly slob; Fenster dresses in sharp suits and mumbles; McManus is wild and temperamental; Keaton is grumpy; Kint is soft-spoken and club-footed. As dialogue exists here only to move characters from one place to the next, it could really be assigned to anyone. Similar lines like "I'll f--k your father in the shower", "I did it to your mother's a-s", and "At least I don't have a captain with his d--k in my a-s all day long", uttered by three separate characters, generate the impression that a single trash talking lowlife is inhabiting five people.The events of the plot have no significance either. The team robs a group of crooked cops in New York, then travels to Los Angeles to pull off another job for a guy called Redfoot, and are finally enlisted by Soze's assistant Kobayashi to steal cocaine. Kint's account of the first two jobs takes about an hour of film time. It'd be of no consequence if it were left out. The heists are redundant and advance the characters in no way at all: Keaton is still grumpy, Hockney is still surly, they all still call each other "cocksucker." The first hour exists only for the stimulation of watching thugs wave guns and beat people up. The film's sense of aprogress, of stalled, redundant cycles, inhabits the interrogation between Kujan and Kint. The characters never progress beyond a pattern of friendliness, petulance, aggression, a big blow-up, threats, ceasefire and then all over again.Verbal's account is presented as objective. He has no reason to lie, so we wouldn't expect him to. However, the film lets us know a minute before it's over that everything we have seen is made up. Apparently, Verbal, using things in the interrogation room for material, mostly the bulletin board behind Kujan, tricked the cop and the film's audience. A post-it note about a guy named Redfoot becomes the character Redfoot, a mug by "Kobayashi" becomes Soze's assistant Kobayashi, and so on. Realizing that a supposedly objective narrator has misled us, we re-evaluate everything that has come before. What really happened? How does the lie illuminate the rest of the story? Singer supplies no answers. Kint walks out of Kujan's office, ending the film.One could say that the filmmakers have done this deliberately, that the absence of character, distinct truth, and connection between events is deliberate. That Singer is a nihilist and this is his view of the world. A viable worldview, fine, but his film can't escape being an antagonistic prank on its audience. Singer uses familiar storytelling tools and setups to snare us and as the story develops, he entices our imaginations with more and more clues to figure out the puzzle. We're intrigued because he's telling us there's an answer, that all this is going somewhere, that every scene and every line is a piece to the puzzle. He dares us to pay attention so maybe we can figure it out before the film does. Riddles do the same thing. For instance, the answer to the riddle, "I'm trying to go home but I can't because the man in the mask; who is the man in the mask?," is "the Catcher." When we find that out, we take pleasure in knowing that the answer was there, all we had to do was think and see the obvious from a different perspective."Suspects" disappoints because the answer was never there for us to see. Customs agent Kujan only notices the material on the bulletin board when he leans up close to it. Whenever the camera lingers with Kint, nothing on the board can be seen distinctly. More important, the film never cues us that Kint might be making it all up. His total immunity from prosecution gives him no reason to waste Kujan's and our time for the entire length of a movie. What Singer ends up doing is cannibalizing the very genre of storytelling he admires. He mocks the thrill of expectation used to tantalize us, only to say that there is no puzzle. Singer's answer to the riddle about the Catcher is the illogic of "there is no man." Much like Verbal Kint's lies, Singer's charade can only be taken as the snub that it is.
A fine example of a movie trying really hard to be a Rubik's Cube.  When a movie starts tripping over itself just for the sake of complicating the plot--that's when I throw up my hands and say, "Enough already!"  It stops being entertaining and enjoyable and begins to be nothing but a chore.  I tried to like this movie, but after being introduced to about 300 characters who all look and act alike (their names even rhyme, for God's sake!), and when the plot demands that we memorize all sorts of details about each one of them to follow the story, that when it stops being fun.  I felt like I was working overtime just to keep up with this mess.When the ending is finally sprung, and I thought about it in the context of the rest of the movie, it should have all made sense, justifying the over-complicated story, but it didn't.  Holes opened up large enough for houses to fall through.  It seemed as if the writer just threw in the most unlikely possibility to astonish the audience.  After the maze he leads us through, it's easy to forget why this doesn't make sense.  It's a real cheap shot.


                
What a waste! Even if this is a "well-crafted" movie, none of the characters are likable, no one but the evil Satanic figure survives, and nothing good comes out of any of their lives. So maybe it's well made, well acted and well directed. So was the Third Reich! Usual Suspects was recommended to me (I should have more carefully considered the source) and my wife and daughter watched it with me. They both agreed there were no redeeming qualities in this film. It's dark, convoluted, and full of loopholes. The most outragious loophole is the fact that Kaiser Soze takes painstaking measures to eliminate the one person who can identify him, all the while appearing in public so much that by the end when he is revealed, everyone in the world will know what he looks like! DUH! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys hearing the F word in nearly every conversation and who derives pleasure seeing scores of people murdered mindlessly. This is the movie for you!
*** WARNING: SPOILERS ***I was loving this movie -- LOVING it -- until the climax. So Kevin Spacey's character's been making it all up as he goes along? Most amusing. And the storyline to which we were wholeheartedly devoting ourselves for the previous 100 minutes (or whatever) turns out to be a neat conman's trick? How delightfully clever. And how completely cynical of the moviemakers. It's their prerogative to take their script in any direction it suits them to, but I couldn't help but feel cheated -- I had actually wanted to know what the outcome of the plot (or what I thought was the plot) would be, not be fobbed off with some kind of superior "you were actually going along with this guy's cornball story? You IDIOT!" attitude. To me, this movie is nothing more than a clever-clever scriptwriting exercise -- all "look what I can do, ma!", and no heart.
The Usual Suspects is one of those movies that you expect to be good because all your fiends say it's good.  People are afraid to say how lousy this is, because their friends will get on them.  But I will say it.  #1, Stephen Baldwin is in it...so how good can it be?  #2 Kevin Spacey is a criminal. He lies to the police and makes up a story to cover his own butt.  The cops have busted him, and instead of confessing, he makes up a lie about the Kaiser.  This movie is considered original? A criminal lies to the police?? THAT is so original?  It happens every single day, people!!!  I can't believe so many people like this movie.  It's about a crook who lies to the cops...like there's something original or shocking about that.  Think about it.  Do you really like this movie because of Stephen Baldwin and a man telling a lie, or do you like it because you know you're supposed to like it...


                
... arrgghhhlll, I can't. Sorry. Why everybody loves this overblown mess is simply beyond me. Yes, this movie is a mess ! Who to blame ? Well, if you ask me, the movie's faults lie within the awful (nonetheless Oscar-winning)(Ah, there's no justice in this world, is it... ?) script, which goes great pains to tell a story that just isn't there. Ever realized that the final "twist" actually doesn't twist anything at all ? So Kevin Spacey was Keyser Soze all along. Boo Hoo. Great Twist, really. Pretty much renders the two hours of movie we endured before it quite useless, doesn't it ? Awful scene-chewery by Gabriel Byrne, too. Well, it's not like this guy isn't awful at everything he does...
I almost feel sorry for anybody who likes this pretentious crap.Mostly everyone who does like it only likes it for one reason...the big twist at the end. But anybody with half a brain that is at least partially functioning can see through the transparent and poorly-written script and predict the ending by the half-hour mark.Spoilers ahead. Do yourself a favor and read them rather than wasting your time watching this mess of a film.OK, the basic plot...cripple is being questioned by a police officer at the police station. The cripple tells the cop about past events that supposedly happened. The stories the cripple tells all seem to contradict one another, and the cop is getting very annoyed since he can't seem to find out the real identity of the man behind the previous events...a man named Keyser Sose.But who is Keyser Sose? I'll tell you who just by explaining what any intelligent movie viewer would have been thinking the entire time, and that is this. Keyser Sose can only be one person, and that person is Verbal Kint. And the reason why he has to be Keyser Sose is because he is the only person that is involved in the story from start to finish. Nobody else is in the office but Verbal and the cop, and we know the cop didn't do it (although that would have been an actual good twist), so it must be Verbal. Can't be any of the other "suspects" because, what if it was? Then the story would move somewhere else and Verbal would no longer be involved.Which brings me to another major flaw...why the hell is Verbal even there in the first place? Him going to the police station serves no purpose at all.And as I patiently waited for the extremely transparent conclusion to be revealed as exactly what I predicted the whole time, I thought of one thing...Verbal is a cripple, so he can't possibly be Keyser Sose. But that was nothing more than a cheap red-herring used only to intentionally throw the viewer off in a different direction. Didn't work very well at all.Why else is this movie total crap? The directing is cheap and thoughtless, acting is decent at best but even that's stretching it, cinematography looks ugly as hell, and I didn't care about any character in the whole movie at all. Didn't give a hell if anybody lived or died. All that paired with the fact that the entire movie was built around the idea of a surprise ending with no substance of itself makes this a piece of garbage.Wait, I'm sorry. Comparing this movie to garbage would be insulting to things I throw away.
Yeah, the film has a very neat ending, real neat. However, in the scheme of things, what else does this film have? Not much. This was one of those pretty good films that gets tagged with the "Great" label, all because it is a little different from the mainstream crap being turned out at Studio City. This is not an epic film, I am sorry. Spacey was good Byrne was good and the ending was clever, but if you take a long hard look at the whole film, you will see average movie making. I just don't see the greatness in the overall film. Now "Frailty", there is a movie that improves on what this film wanted to be.


                
Before I watched the movie, I've read many comments comparing "The Usual Suspects" with "L.A. Confidential", which concluded that this one is even better. So I held an eminent anticipation on it. But two hours later, I just could not understand why this nonsense got so much higher votes and evaluation than "L.A. Confidential".I'm saying this, not because of the labels people usually will put on this movie: confusing, twisted and so on. Actually, I don't think the plot is hard to comprehend. To be honest, I figured out who Kaiser is just at the very beginning. It was so obvious.The reason is, many fabulous elements in "L.A. Confidential", or should I say, a successful movie, are missing. First of all, the most important thing: the vivid sculpture of the characters. From "L.A. Confidential", we remember the three young cops, the evil captain, the gorgeous hooker, the sly and sneaky little old news reporter<U+0085> So many impressive roles there. But what is in "The Usual Suspects"? I feel sorry to say, nothing. Maybe Kevin Spacey's performance can be a little compensation, but not enough at all.Second of all, the conflict. In "L.A. Confidential", conflicts are everywhere, between justice and crime, between righteousness and personal career, between love and cheat, between different parts or even in the deep soul of one part. While in "The Usual Suspects", without these conflicts, the movie is not dramatic and attractive but cadaverous and boring.The third one, ambiance. In "L.A. Confidential", I can sense the emotion the director planed to deliver to us. Sometimes intensive, sometimes thrilling, sometimes dangerous, sometimes love-filling, sometimes nervous, sometimes horrifying<U+0085>.Well, when I watched this one, I almost fell asleep in the middle.I don't think we need a fourth reason to prove this crap. I hate these plays which consider themselves intelligent and tricky enough to make up some mendacious tales to bluff the audience, and turn out to be so stupid and fake. There is always a wire-puller in such movies, who seems to be omnipotent and can do whatever he wants, conniving some brilliant schemes. But finally these schemes are always deliberately mystifying and illogical. I prefer real and organized films like "L.A. Confidential". You know, we audience are also smart.


                
I don't like this movie. I think it's extremely boring. The first time I saw it I just kept on thinking "When is something actually going to happen?" Most of the movie they just talk and talk. The ending is fine, but the rest of the movie cannot at all stand up to it. I guess the director and scriptwriters had a very bad day when they decided to make this movie. That day they made a mistake - the movie should never have been made. My recommendation: don't see Usual Suspects, it's a complete waste of time.


                
This movie was so boring that I had to fast forward through scenes just to get through it.  I figured out the "surprise" within the first 20 minutes of the movie, so I don't see what the big deal over that was - could it have been more obvious?  Finally, the stupid, melodramatic way that they handled the scenes and dialogue was tedious and insulting.


                
This movie is nothing but a complete waste of time. There is absolutely no logic in the story, the characters are boring and everything is mixed together and that makes the movie very confusing and extremely boring.
Five stupid men are the main characters, and all they do is talk about stupid things in a boring way. Occasionally the director puts in a little stupid action which makes no particular sense.Overall: A very clumsy attempt to make a crime movie. And I'm sorry that it isn't possible to vote less than 1 for this movie failure. It's a disgrace to the whole movie industry.If you want to see a brilliant crime movie you should try "Seven" or "The Silence Of The Lambs". True classics!


                
One cannot deny, the clever twist, and the movie that cemented the cult of kevin spacey. But, this one really is a ponzi scheme of a movie. I am willing to except a few flaws, and even a Cabinet of Caligari misdirection, but this leaves me cheated.  the house of cards falls and tosses the suspension of disbelief out, and goes for sleight of hand. oh well. at least this one gave the teen male audiences, something else to rave about other than tarantino movies.


                
Wow ... I heard so many extraordinary things about The Usual Suspects, that, like so many others, I was lured to the theater by very enthusiastic word-of-mouth.  The catch (plot twist, surprise ending) is so painfully obvious through the movie that you simply have endure ridiculous dialogue, mediocre cinematography and drillingly painful stereotypes to find out what you already knew.  The only saving grace of this incredibly overrated film is the fine cast of actors, specifically Stephen Baldwin, Byrne and Del Toro.  Spacey is so-so and Kevin Pollack is himself, but they are still far more enjoyable than anything else the film offers.Overrated and excessive.  Certain to insult your intelligence. Grade: 65%


                
This movie is SO mediocre thats its insane! Yet another phony cult following that jumps the bandwagon on the "whats cool" tip. The story is average at best, acting is good, nothing extraordinary...just NOTHING stands out about it. And 99% of masses who voted 9s or 10s cant back up their reason for voting either, that just proves my point further. Just bothers me that SO MANY people cant make their own decisions and flock to what is hyped and told to be the "COOL" thing. Media controlled sheep....BAAAAAA!There are plenty of movies out there that have better stories, better acting, and much more substance to them than this movie, but they don't get the votes cause they don't have a phony following attached to themselves.


                
I remember seeing this movie at the theater and thinking it was great. In reality, all that was really great was the creative ending. I really did not see it coming. However, years later I watched this and really found my eyes straining quite a bit. The performance are overdone (Baldwin is terrible), the dialog is somewhat silly (laughable in many parts) and the story is often ludacris (why the guys pull off the crime). No, this is one of those movies with a great ending, which  really distorts your perception of the entire movie. The plot is lame. Many parts of the film lack even a remote sense of reality. In retrospect, this movies looks like the work of a first year film student. It just was more silly than good. As for the high ranking on this site, I just wonder, who really has examined this film closely? I think if you have, you would see that it really wasn't that great.


                
Well I don't know what to say about this one.  Everyone in theuniverse seems to think it's pretty good.  I for one hated it from thevery beginning.  I usually like Kevin Spacey films and almostalways hate Stephen Baldwin's, and yet I think this goes in theBaldwin file, and not the Spacey, sadly.SPOILER!!!!
At the very beginning Spacey is telling the story of how CaiserSosa extinguished the flame leading to the explosives by urinatingfrom atop a building.  My immediate response was "NO WAY. WHAT A LIAR!!"  And thus the ending was spoiled.RETURN TO NON SPOILER.Watch this to see what the fuss is about, but keep in mind, whatyou're thinking as you watch is probably right ...
This glossy, unimpressive film has a made-for-TV feel, and as such few viewers will probably be aware to look in the past for it's inspiration: Hitchcock's "Stagefright," with his typical falsely-accused hero on the run narrates his story which we believe until the end when it turns out to be false and he really is the murderer(sound familiar?); a nice twist on Hitch's own movies. Spacey's gnarled hand in the form of the devil's horns or evil eye, was used symbolically in "The Dark Past" with evil gangster William Holden being psychoanalysed by a hostage psychiatrist (sounds crazy but the film works). Holden's hand is paralysed in the same way to represent his evil id until the end.  The gullible detective who believes Spacey's innocence foreshadows the film's twist-end since all we see is one long flashback. Like the "Bladerunner" scene of Ford instructing a computer enhancement of a photo (this had become such a cliche in detective films that they stopped using it) younger audiences will ooh and ahh over old wine in plastic bottles.
