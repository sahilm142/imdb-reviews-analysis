 Not quite so elementary! Brilliant indeed!

 Season 4 up to episode 2 is subpar. Why? Well....

 Good Sunday TV

 Season 3 just Horrible!! Almost insufferable to watch.

 A crafty contemporary retake on a classic...

 It's sliding into the abyss boys and girls

 Initially this was astounding, sadly that form failed in the last two seasons.

 Delightfully Well Adapted Depiction of a Legend

 Brilliant but could have been better for a few episodes.

 Season 1, 2 & 3 Review

 A very seriously approached yet very entertaining show

 Modern

 The Holmes Watson Chemistry

 Impressive...

 i follow with light sky

 The Xmas Special was a breath of fresh (old) air, but what now?

 best TV show ever

 Really good until...

 Good modernised version of the classic detective

 So ... we have new clone of Dr. House

 The one worth to watch

 All in all, a great series

 Equal to a High Quality Ornament

 A not-so-surprising modern twist on Sir Doyle's works.

 Just what a modern Sherlock Holmes should look like
