 Totally over-hyped, but fails to deliver. Any wonder audiences are so slim?

 Is The Shield that bad? Yes!

 Badly Made and therefore Poorly Rated

 No Justification for How Badly made it is

 A Bad Show By Any Other Name

 A Low Point for Television

 Practically Unwatchable

 Hideously Bad Show

 Beware of the Shield Shills: This one is really a Turkey

 Overwrought, Overdone, Over-hyped and in the end a Huge Disappointment

 Why The Shield is a ratings failure

 So Bad!

 The Pretense of Realism doesn't make The Shield any less Poorly Made

 Audiences Rejected This Bad Show a Long Time Ago

 Unwatchable Claptrap - A Must-Miss

 Bad Show and Bad Camera-work by Any Other Name...

 Nicely packaged, nicely filmed garbage.

 Nothing New, Just Bad Old Film-making

 A True Propaganda Achievement

 Badges on the wrong side
