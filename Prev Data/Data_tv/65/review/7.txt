Nathan has ridiculous ideas and he's extremely awkward and it's a great combination. Sometimes he gets a little too awkward but then he will quickly make up for it by being hilarious. For awhile I thought the show might be real but there were enough fake things to prove that it is definitely scripted. This show even taught me something, there are almost no English speaking people in southern California. Check it out if you are free the 30 minutes a day CC isn't playing South Park or Futurama.
