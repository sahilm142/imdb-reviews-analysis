I have not seen every single episode of this show but I watched four episodes last year.The first one was where Peter and Jubliee go to Russia to stop cable. The second one was where Cyclops leaves the team to his childhood foster home to discover the purple man is using Mutant Children as weapons, the third one is where Jubliee is looking after some school kids during a cave visit and the last one was where Rouge goes to a countryside to recruit a mutant young man.Overall this show was excellent and it had a good theme song.
