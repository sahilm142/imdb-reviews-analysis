The first thing I realized when I saw this film was that Disney is running out of ideas for good films. I never thought they would be resorted to base their films of rides in their amusement parks. It's a pirate film with some good acting but Orlando Bloom proves yet again that he can't act. After the daughter of the governor of an island in the Caribbean is captured by mysterious pirates, only two people are able to save the beloved Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). These two men are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Some how they are able to comender a British super vessel able to navigate it across the ocean. The movie just went way to long, topping two hours and twenty minutes, way to long for a Disney film. Jerry Bruckheimer adds tons of corny lines and supposed battle scenes between undead pirates and British Soldiers . Johnny Deep and Geoffery Rush do what they can with the roles they're given. Their are some beautiful filmed scenes of the ocean but their really isn't a story. I guess you could call this entertaining for a nine year old but for anyone else it's just a yawn fest. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Starring: Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Geoffery Rush, Keira Knightley, and Jack Davenport. 2 out of 5 Stars.
When I sat down to watch this movie, I was expecting to see a movie that was decent at best. I was very surprised to find how unbelievably bad it was. The plot is non-sensical jibberish. The characters are all one-dimensional, either good-to-the-heart, or bad-to-the-bone, with absolutely no variations. The acting is horrendous, Johnny Depp is like a washed-up rock-star, heavily drugged and very drunk, the entire time. Orlando Bloom is nothing but a simple rehash of the knight in shining armor, if only a bit more easily tolerated. Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress, pure and simple, nothing else. Something I found ridiculous, was that every other character, even minor characters, mastered sword fighting. The humor is unbelievably childish, at several times it was on the level of the newer Simpsons episodes, which made me cringe more than I believed was possible. All of the CGI effects were very bland, most looked like they could easily have been made at the same mediocre quality several years ago. Why so many people claim this is a great film eludes me. If you ever even consider to sit down and watch this, make sure you keep your expectations very low. Very overrated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as it is simply too long, too boring, too bland and too cringe-worthy to be the least bit enjoyable. 3/10


                
Could their be a more over-rated film this year. While okay in part, I think the main reason behind it's success is the fact that some people take a liking to Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. It has problems classifying what type of film it is. Not enough action to be a action film. Not enough laughs to be a comedy. It has also been put up for major awards, yet it is clearly a blockbuster. 'Its both of these,' you may say. That is not the case as the poor attempts at jokes do not work. Johnny Depp probably deserved his Golden Globe nomination, not his Oscar nomination though. His character, along with everyone elses, is one-dimensional and conforms to stereotypes. Bloom plays Legolas very well to say the setting has changed. the other actors are fairly decent in their roles. A plot that i could predict in my sleep and a boring script prevent it from being good. What could have been a great 90 minute blockbuster has been stretched to 2 and a half hours on a plot that cannot manage it.*1/2 out of ****p.s. It has been hyped up recently. If you have'nt seen it yet, don't.


                
Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl - The movie is as aimless as the tittle. Pirates attack a settlement known as Port Royal and capture the town's governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), as they believe that she is the one who can remove a curse set upon them. They lug her aboard the Black Pearl, their ominous sailing ship. In a prison in a battered garrison in Port Royal, William Turner (Orlando Bloom) makes arrangements to free Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), A captive, and some-what idiotic pirate, in exchange for his aid to rescue Miss Elizabeth Swann, the woman who William is madly in love with. Along the way, there are many sword fights, but as this movie is a pirate one, viewers will expect a major death. Sadly there are none. Most of the time it miraculously stops or those cursed pirates never die, because they're practically undead. Many of the fights are absolutely retarded and pointless, with no purpose what so ever, except just to allow this movie to be classified under a pirate theme. The director, Gore Verbinski, made a horrific effort to add suspense, and about the only scary thing in the film is a cursed monkey!The characters, although interesting at first impression, soon get boring and ridiculous! Jack Sparrow has a major speech impediment, always looks like he's drunk 24/7 and seems to have hands that don't look connected to his wrists! His opening scene where viewers first catch a gimps of Jack was quite comical, but his later acts were plain, foolish. It's impossible to believe that such a pirate could even be conceived! The actor Johnny Depp played a magnificent part, but it's Disney's lack in concept to produce a more credible character, which unfortunately destroyed the feel of a real pirate film. The character William Turner was an even bigger let down. His jokes are dry to the bone, at best they my cause a chuckle. His character's desires are typical of what modern movies are about. All of this was made worst with the selection of actor to play the role. Orlando Bloom's parts in the film were particularly weak and lacking in emphasis, as you felt that Jack Sparrow was more important then the less adventurous blacksmith Will.The few good things about, The Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl are the tunes and the CGI effects. These are the only factors that keep the viewer from going to sleep! The music is on the dot, particularly when you see beautiful long shots of the surroundings. You'll get butterflies in you stomach, similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, when you witness the sight of the Computer Generated Images! Since the cursed pirates can only take the undead form in certain conditions, the lighting, and shadow effects make these images top-notch.This film is better of to just have CGI pirates walking around, raiding random ships, then to have poorly thought of characters, residing in the picture. There is too much that has been added to the film, and the mambo-jumbo comedy, action, thriller, love story, adventure theme is just a missive cliché of genres. The attempt made by Disney to have a classical family movie was a disastrous shamble! Millions of dollars have been wasted, down drain on actors who don't even suit the characters. I strongly recommend no one see this monstrous movie, as viewers would also be throwing away their money down the drain.


                
The only thing memorable about 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' will be Johnny Depp's usual out-standing performance.I can only hope that this 'Blockbuster' featurette won't do for his acting career what "Leaving Las Vegas" did to Nick Cage's.  Remember Nicholas Cage, a quirky, interesting actor who was almost always worth watching, no matter how bad the movie?  Then his big moment in "Leaving Las Vegas", and he hasn't done a thing worth watching on-screen since then, including his woefully lackluster performance in Martin Scorcese's 1999 film, "Bringing Out The Dead", where Mr. Cage would only be considered interesting in contrast to John Goodman's typically bombastic, bizarre, supporting-actor overdoses.Now it's Mr. Depp's turn as an actor.  Either he will continue to pick and choose his movies based on the merit he sees in them as an actor, along the lines of the late, great, Gregory Peck, and the still living, and equally astounding, Meryl Streep; or, he will pick and choose his movies based on how much money someone is willing to pay him for his 'appearing in' their studio's (insert studio name) production of (insert producer's name and/or production company name)  film directed by (insert director's name), and starring (insert actor's name).I am rooting for the uniqueness of Johnny Depp, of course.For a movie as over-produced as "Pirates of the Caribbean" is, with the occasional well-done special effect (which should be a given considering the money spent), and interesting costuming (especially in the 'heaving-bossoms' scenes), some of the 'special effects' come off rather mediocre in comparison to better done summer fodder.  The distance shot of the burning Port would have been at home in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds".  The underwater skeleton-walking scenes looked like out-takes from "Clash of The Titans".The humor of the movie is also in question, first during the looting of the British Naval Port and attacks on it's citizens by the pirates, with scenes of murder and attempted rape, played on film as quasi-comedy (in someone's seriously disturbed idea of entertainment); and also during the scenes when British Sailors are being slaughtered left and right onboard their own ship, immediately after the Pirates' underwater skeleton-walking scene, although these sailors are mostly being dis-embowelled off-screen so as to further distance us from contemplating the possibility of their deaths, and we are coerced instead into laughing at a Pirate's severed boney claw, clutching for the cowardly Governor Swann's throat.  A character foppishly over-played by Jonathan Pryce. Can anyone say "Vincent Price" cheese-ball?The dashingly pretty Orlando Bloom, as Will Turner, barely registers a ripple of a human nuance, rather like observing an interesting wall-paper. Likewise for Keira Knightley, as his longed-to-be-statuette-on-a-pedestal, Elizabeth Swann, the (of course!) Governor's daughter.  For a good acting comparison see Kate Winslett in "Titanic". Both parts seemingly conceived by a group of writers discovering cheap plastic glow-in-the-dark religious icons for the first time and attempting to pass them off as feminine Heaven.On screen for an hour too long, with convoluted plot 'twists' packing the wallop of moist cardboard, character actors required to do uninteresting comic 'bits' that might amuse a two-year old, screen-writing that barely rises to a fourth grade school play, wooden acting filmed along the lines of "Stand there and don't move while we shoot the scene", yet another 'typical' Hollywood feel-good ending, and, voila!, this summer's simple-minded Block-Buster movie is completed.On to the usual mass-merchandising, burger chain tie-ins (no matter how oddly far-fetched), and 'direct-to-DVD' sequel(s)!  Thank you very much.


                
Thank god there are other people in the world whom don't 'love' this film. Pirates of the Caribbean is so overrated, if it wasn't for johnny depp, then it would be a washout completely, which says a great deal about it. If I am honest I fell asleep about three quarters of the way through the film, out of sheer boredom, i think Knightley's famous line 'try wearing a corset' set me down for the night. I saw this film last year, and had expected a masterpiece since many people had such high praises for it. The storyline is mediocre, the acting of two of the key actors, Knightly and Bloom (sorry I don't know their characters names, there is a simple reason for this!) is very average. I can remember very little from the film, as it has mere substance. Unfortunately, I have to now deal with people having panic attacks over the release of the sequel..oh well.


                
Among all of my friends who saw this movie, both pirate/Depp fanatics and neutral, told me that it was such an amazing movie, and that they are excited about the sequel that's coming soon, and how I HAVE to see this movie. So, I did.I got pretty much what I expected, except less. I found the jokes unamusing, action sequence unexciting, the music just droning on-and-on-and-on... Really, I mean, what was so spectacular about this movie? I'm surprised that I managed to stay wake for the ordeal.The acting was good, I guess. I wasn't too impressed with any of the characters. Jack Sparrow was kind of amusing, but his antics got really old very fast. Orlando Bloom and Knightly's characters were plain boring. But the character I was most disappointed in was Captain Barbossa -- such an uninteresting villain, absolutely no noteworthy character.I'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10, and I feel like I'm being generous. I know I'm not going to spend my hard earned dollars on the sequel.


                
This is one of those movies you hate to pan, everyone on screen seems to be trying so hard to make something out of the material. Sometimes, even the best efforts can't rescue a plot thinner than the skins of the villains. And therein lies the problem. All the special effects, all the fencing, and ship to ship fighting, can't rescue this film. Given the lack of a story worth hanging a hat on, Johnny Depp does his best to give the film a center, but he is undercut. On one side is Geoffrey Rush chewing scenery faster than it can be built. I keep hoping to see him in a role that requires some subtlety, because I believe he is capable of greater things than anything I've seen him in recently. On the other side are Orlando Bloom and Kira Sedgewick gamely trying to give the film some romance. If only they were given some material to work with. At best, this film is a good way to spend a couple of hours where the alternative is banging your head against the wall.


                
It's been a while since I've seen it, but at least there's a chance now that it will fall out of the top 250.I even bought the DVD of it because everyone said it is sooooooo great, and I actually hoped that it might be something like a film version of Monkey Island, which might be the best adventure computer game ever made.I was totally disappointed, it was supposed to be a comedy, but only moderately funny, and I dragged myself through watching it (maybe I fast forwarded it, I'm not sure) and sold the DVD afterwards.I really don't get what's so great about it? Just an average Disney story, a well known, good looking actor and a huge marketing hype, so that even all the movie critics and the Oscar jury believe that it is a good move doesn't make it good. If it's not entertaining or contains a great, unusual idea, it could at least have contained some serious message, but of course also didn't - so I just don't get it why everyone likes it.At least I got most of my money back, but I still hope that some day there will be a real movie using the Monkey Island Plot.What I've learned: Never buy a DVD (at least not for full price) just because everyone says it's great.


                
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" has to be one film I'm addding to my "Worst Films of 2003" list."Pirates" has to be "one" of the oddest, strangest, most over-the-top, far out, blockbuster film's of the summer 2003 lot. For starters, director Verbinski isn't enough of a stylist to pull off the script's delicate balancing act. As he showed with the "The Mexican" Verbinski has problems finding just the right tone between humor and adventure. The film is never quite funny enough to make us forget that dramatically it's pretty slim stuff. With is combination of action, comedy, over the top acting, big sets and one-liners this movie couldn't be taken too seriously for an action film and it so far off the map that it couldn't be called a comedy.For one thing Johnny Depp, who delivers what has to be the strangest lead performance in a $150 million Hollywood production to date, and has to be the only one brave enough to play a gay drunk pirate this side of the Caribbean. Wait until you see what Depp does here. You can't take your eyes off him!! He is funny, crazy and he over takes every single scean he is in. Even Geoffrey Rush is over shadowed by Depps's over the top performance.Geoffrey Rush was great in his role as Barbossa, and it shows what a great actor Geoffrey Rush really his; and how multi-talented he really his even when he sells out to crap like "The Banger Sisters" or "pirates" He can make a really bad role work for him. But it was Depp's film and he ran with it!Keira Knightley, well not much to say except she is a really bad actress and how many times do we have to set her either wet or getting her clothes ripped off with out once having bad hair or runny make-up?Orlando Bloom was flat, his character was a cardbaord cut out of every single character out to rescuse the woman he loves and finds himself an adventure."Pirates" was a bad movie, but Depp's over the top performance was the best thing and the only thing besides the over top F/X and interesting story line that keeps this mess afloat!Yes folks; the story had promise. Real promise. But somewhere between directors Gore Verbinski ideas, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ideas the story somehow merged 2 diffrent out looks with no real mediuem. The whole film felt like "Treasure Island" meets "The Fog"!With a running time of two hours plus, "Pirates of the Caribbean" feels terribly flabby, even the over the top battle scenes are so drawn out we start to lose interest.Depp's odd performance should probably make this film live on as a cult classic and become recognized by film buff's as a bad film that we love.One word to describe "Pirates" is "BIZZARE"!


                
Okay, what the hell happened?  Yesterday, I checked here to see what people were thinking of this movie, and judging by the comments, it looked like a good movie to see with my girlfriend.Ugh, not even close.  I gave this movie a 3 in the vote, and that was for its only redeeming feature, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Without the characterization he gave, this movie had nothing, nothing to hold my interest.The love story was uninvolving.  The pirates were kind of cool, and the action was decent.  But you know things are going bad when at one point in the movie, you're laughing because the lead actress's lipstick glaringly sticks out considering her circumstances at the time.  Set in colonial times, and lacking access to anything remotely resembling Revlon, I couldn't decide to laugh or groan at such poor makeup, direction, and review.
The only reason I would recommend this movie to anyone is if someone is a fan of Johnny Depp.  He was excellent.  But rent it, don't spend your money at the theater for this.


                
Whoa is me.  Johnny Depp didn't take this film very seriously.  I know it's not a serious film but actor decisions are and either he or the director made some very bad choices for the Captain Sparrow character. He was so swishy.  Who is the hero in this film?  No one.  I didn't care about any of these people.  In addition, this is a two joke movie: 1) Look mom. The pirates turn into skeletons in the moonlight at least 1567 times.  Isn't that fun?  2) Look mom.  An eyeball has a fork in it and it rolls along the ground and it falls out of that guys face and...Isn't that fun?  Nope. It isn't fun or funny or interesting after the first time.  And although the combat scenes are well choreographed - ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!!  I fell asleep twice.  I was sooooo disappointed.  I really wanted to like this film.


                
Having fond childhood memories of old pirate movies and stories, I was really looking forward to watch this one. I certainly didn't expect some brain challenging epic, but good entertainment. I was disappointed.Many things may be said of old, classic movies, but one thing is certain, they generally had good scripts. What has happened to good Hollywood scriptwriters? Don't they exist anymore or are they all working for TV at HBO? This film has a potentially good story and a completely pathetic script that results in a plot that most of the time makes no sense whatsoever, with bad dialogue lines, and awkward twists trying to disguise as "complex turns". Simple bad writing.At least they got someone witty to write Captain Jack Sparrow's lines. Without doubt, the one outstanding thing about this movie is Johny Deep's character and his rendition of it. It is very funny and thoroughly enjoyable. Depending how you look at it, Deep's performance is either wasted in this movie, or saves it.


                
really bad film. there is no script, lousy direction [Verbinski got even worse since "the mexican (2001)"]and poor (cliche) characters. ***************** spoilers ********************what kind of pirate movie is this, without a bad guy?!? barbossa wasn't evil at all and english officer was a noble man. sparow was from beginning too obviously a good guy. it should be more mixed character. maybe more selfish or something. missed genre is another thing: too much comedy and action, not enough adventure. the worst are action sequences which are meaningless because pirates are immortal. camera angle is changing too fast so you wont see any decent sword fighting neither. just ONE sea battle doesnt contribute much to the piracy of the movie.**************** spoilers *********************** actors were more than average - depp was (probably intentionally) overacting, other were merely acting. special effects were nothing special. no better than in any other blockbuster. i liked the make up though.
This movie was one of the most boring movies that I have seen this year. It was slow paced the whole movie with little to no action at all.  The movie was about a half hour too long and none of the characters were likeable other than Orlando Bloom's character.  Two disappointing thumbs down!!!!!!!!!!!


                
After watching one of the greatest pirate movies ever made (Captain Blood,) I decided to finally give this a try. People are astounded that I have never seen a PotC movie. Nope. Not one. Never. Why? Not interested so much in the Hollywood machine. They do make some good films, and give plenty of regular people jobs, but I'm not a sheep, thanks; I'll stick to watching what I like to watch and if I watch a "Pirates" movie someday then so be it. Well, someday arrived tonight and I must say, I am not impressed. Nope. Not really. Johnny Depp has some funny moments but two hours of him acting like that is too much. And Captain Jack Sparrow is barely a pirate. A leader of men? Give me a break. He's pathetic. There's some good acting from Keira Knightly and Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport, but Depp's hammyness is borderline mental and helps ruin this movie. And what's with the CGI skeleton pirates? I thought this was gonna be a pirate movie. It's McDisney junk food that's only mildly entertaining at best. I was more bored than entertained.5.3 / 10 stars--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener


                
Acting was decent, though I was expecting more of the Jack Sparrow character after reading all of the reviews.  Special effects were good too.  This was certainly a visually stunning film.  Overall a 7 out of 10.


                
Over all the movie ended up being ok, in spite of the fact it could have been great. But as anyone who's familiar with Jerry Bruckheimer movies knows, lots of scenes ended up being over dramatized, over humored, grossly contrived scenarios, a lot of style with very little substance, and generally for people with low intellect and attention spans.But as someone else pointed out, it should at least be pretty fun for the kids. Johnny Depp's character, while over the top, was still pretty entertaining as a pirate who's got a screw loose, or one sandwich shy of a picnic (which in the movie seems to mean having effeminate mannerisms). All the other characters are mind numbingly cliched.The real stars of the movie, of course, are the special effects. Spectacular transition effects done almost seamlessly. So gather of the kids and head on down to the matinee. If you're an adult, you might want to have a drink first and check your IQ at the door. Trust me; you'll have a better time.


                
Despite the phenomenal popularity of the (thus far) four installments of the "Pirates of the Caribbean (POC)" cinematic franchise, I've found it to be a monumental disappointment. Being such a fan of the original Disneyland ride ever since it first debuted back in 1967 (I once got off the ride and got right back in line for it seven times in a row<U+0085>), I can't tell you how eager and excited I was to run out and see the first POC installment, "Curse of the Black Pearl," way back in 2003 especially since it starred one of my favorite cinematic actors, Johnny Depp. Oh how tragic to experience my initial eagerness and excitement quickly fade into bitter disappointment and frustration! What was immediately apparent to me was the almost complete disconnect between the vision and experience created by the ride and the vision now being projected up on the big screen. With all of its extravagant cinematography and special effects and over-the-top and even ridiculous characterizations of characters who never appeared in the ride, the film just didn't have the same creepy excitement and fantasy-world fun generated by the ride.And these serious deficiencies have persisted throughout all three of the sequels. In particular, Johnny Depp's character of Jack Sparrow is just too fey, effete and just plain silly, Orlando Bloom (whom I despise) is too much of what he always is in every movie he's in – an inconsequential "pretty boy" that inspires absolutely no excitement or interest and Keira Knightly, a "pretty bit of fluff" who was "force fed" into the POC cinematic franchise purely out of political correctness, i.e., "we (the writers and producers of the POC films) must make sure that the world of the pirate which has been traditionally portrayed as all male is properly "updated" in our productions to be politically correct in including at least one woman main character..." Yes, there are the historical accounts of at least two very prominent women pirates, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, but I'm sure they didn't look or act anything like Keira Knightley's character – and she certainly was never even hinted at in the original Disneyland ride<U+0085> As a result, she is completely out of place and really detracts and distracts from the plot lines of all of the POC installments. She doesn't even work successfully as a "love interest" for Orlando Bloom or Johnny Depp as Olivia de Havilland did with Errol Flynn in "Captain Blood" or Maureen O'Hara did with EF and Anthony Quinn in "Against All Flags" since her (Knightley's) character suffers the confused split personality of being that of a butch female swashbuckler (completely unbelievable and stupid!) and a sexy feminine dish (much more likely)....Out of a real dedication to my affection for the original ride, despite my bitter disappointment with the first installment, I've forced myself to see every one of the sequels hoping against hope that "things would get better," i.e. the films would get closer to the look and spirit of the ride – and that Orlando Bloom and/or Keira Knightley would be killed off or otherwise just disappear! Praise be to Providence that this actually did come to pass in the third sequel – BUT it's too little too late and I'm still left with the feeling of a lover who has watched the "perfect woman of his dreams" become the "the nightmare hag from hell<U+0085>"


                
The first swordfight can sum up the whole movie. They jump on a board, one guy flies up in the air, he lands on the board again and the other one goes up. And the brain-dead audience laughs, they actually laugh - it's a sin against anyone who considers film an art form.In the words of Tyler Durden, `Murder, crime, poverty-these thing don't concern me.' And his right, it should not concern us as much as Pirates of the Caribbean. Because crime and poverty is things a fraction of mankind have to deal with daily. Stupidity on the other hand is something that affects everyone living today. What should concern us is that a majority of mankind's new favourite movie is on an intellectual level of Teletubbies.To actually criticize Pirates of the Caribbean through pointing out the lack of character development, the fact that every character and every scene is a cliché or the all-around dreadfulness of the script, is pointless. No one that can formulate an intelligent answer can deny it.I would instead like to share with you an epiphany I have had pondering this movie. The question I asked myself was why people have so different experiences watching the same movie? The answer is simply that the child enjoying Teletubbies have a different level of understanding than the adult.The same answer applies to why some people think movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean and A Knights Tale are `brilliant'. And thinks Citizen Kane and A Clockwork Orange are the worst movies ever made.This doesn't seem like such a catastrophe, we are all different, we accept that and get along anyway. But it is a catastrophe to quality filmmaking, because money-grubbing filmmakers without a sense for art will use the same pre-build Hollywood-scripts and recycle the same garbage for generations.Perhaps it's also a catastrophe for human intelligence. Not that a bad movie magically would drain the viewers IQ but it will in another way deprive the viewer from knowledge. Everything is a choice and through seeing a Jerry Bruckheimer flick instead of a Stanley Kubrick film the viewer loses an intellectual experience.How the loss of quality art would affect the democratic system in the long run, which only chance of working at all is if the average voter has a reasonably high level of understanding, is not that hard to imagine.


                
Generally I dislike pirate movies, especially Hollywood ones. In fact the majority of historical adventures made after the '60s aren't usually worth watching. But this film caused a big fuss in the cinema, everybody applauded Johnny Depp's performance, and it even featured cursed pirates who turn into skeletons in the moonlight. Sounded a bit like JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. So I watched it. I guess I should have been forewarned, knowing this was a Disney movie, but I went ahead with best intentions hoping to enjoy the whole thing.Unfortunately, I didn't. This film is a mess. From the moment you first see Johnny Depp you realise what a misfire this is, a popcorn, brainless piece of trash specially geared towards teenage girls. It's a film where the female audience watches only because the "hunky" Orlando Bloom is in it. Sorry, girls; although he's pretty (although far too feminine) he can't act for peanuts. I want to see this guy get his teeth into some real material, like when Brad Pitt tore people's throats out in KALIFORNIA. Maybe then I'll respect him. For now he's just a wooden statue, torn loose after his part in LORD OF THE RINGS and already becoming typecast as a handsome but empty action vessel.Nothing wrong with the scenery or the special effects though. The skeleton pirates are great CGI creations but appear far too little. Plus this is a two hour film where nothing happens to further the slim plot for an hour or so. Try hard to stifle the yawns. The story is non-existent, the dialogue atrocious and even worse, clichéd. It's all so predictable these days. The film is played as a comedy, but the jokes are lame and tired. In fact I hated them. The only mildly amusing thing is Mackenzie Crook's wooden eye. As for the action, it sucks. One of the first things you see is Depp sliding down a rope, that was tired when Kevin Costner did it back in WATERWORLD, now its just sad. The sword fight between Depp and Bloom is pathetic, no excitement or skill whatsoever. The action at the finale is also particularly bad and unappealing, with a bunch of characters you want to see die, a load of stupid sets, and more rubbish acting than you can shake a stick at.Depp is atrocious – how desperately did he need the money for this one? Usually Depp makes great choices in some great films. I loved him in FROM HELL and ED WOOD. Here, he acts so over-the-top and stoned all the time, it quickly becomes boring. This isn't acting, it's over-acting, and a disgraceful performance. You're not funny, Depp, so move your backside and make some good films again. Supposedly 'hot' Keira Knightley is also bland, looking like a million other young girls, pretty but nothing to distinguish her. As for the good actors: Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce are given absolutely NOTHING to work with, just standing around and looking good. Geoffrey Rush is also uninvolving as the chief villain, who does nothing very villainous, doesn't even kill anybody I don't think. Rush is poor here. Go back to making proper films! Definitely worth a miss, this one. Total rubbish from beginning to end with only a few good special effects to make it even a little worthwhile. Don't see it. Unless you're a teenage girl. With a crush on a made-up Johnny Depp. And Orlando Sodding Bloom.
"Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male," a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.With hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!) I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.
