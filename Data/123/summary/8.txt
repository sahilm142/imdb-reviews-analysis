 The complexity of characterization and the dynamism of the action raise the film above cliché...

 De Niro v. Pacino... Fight!

 Classic Crime Film with an All-Time Great Cast

 what a treat

 Overdone but good

 A Classic

 Heat is exactly what it says...a crime saga...not your average action crime flick

 Great Writing, Great Production

 Michael Mann's ode to the city of angels.

 Great mid 90s action

 A Pioneer for Heist Films

 The Marty Turco of movies (underrated for you non-hockey fans)

 Pacino would never kill De Niro!!!!

 Entertaining rebirth of the cops and robbers genre

 smart, stylish but lacks real spark

 Better than Bullitt

 wow! the best action

 Big-Time Crime Drama

 Fun, but no work of genius

 Two Great Actors In One Great Movie

 stylish, uber cool, crime epic

 Two Monsters in the same movie

 Refreshing change...

 excellent movie

 A definite keeper, except for one thing. (*Warning: contains spoilers*)
