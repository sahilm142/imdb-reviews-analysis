 Comments from a Vietnam veteran

 War is hell, but so is watching this movie.

 Deerhunter or should it be Beerhunters?

 Brilliant cast and director; overpraised twisted propaganda

 Is that what all the fuss was about in 78?

 Is that how it was ? . . . must have missed it when I was there.

 Pretentious, meandering nonsense.

 Boring, unending and most of all overrated

 So bad it hurts too watch it.

 simplistic and blatantly one-sided look at Vietnam

 Don't look for Rambo here ...

 The Russian roulette sequence

 A film that has received too much credit

 Indulgent Tripe

 one of the slowest movies ever made

 disappointed

 Average Film

 Don't EVER do that to me again.

 Disappointing

 people just love boring movies

 Question 4

 Review of the Deer Hunter

 not very interesting, but realistic drama of citizens who want to serve

 One of the poorer editing jobs makes this tedious as hell
