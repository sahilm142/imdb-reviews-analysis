 Forget the haters

 Cute Where The Office is Awkward

 Funniest show on TV (surprisingly)

 Very endearing, while absolutely hilarious!

 Better Each Time I Watch!

 Fantastic, A Classic In My Book

 Addicting background TV

 Most hilarious thing I've EVER SEEN!!

 Brilliantly Hilarious -- and Hilariously Brilliant! Fantastic!

 Pure joy to watch

 The cute (in a good way) version of "The Office"

 Very satirically real

 Very Funny

 My favorite show of all time!!

 No words!

 Best Comedy Show on Television

 One of the Greatest Television Comedies

 I can count on one hand the number of shows that make me laugh out loud when I am watching alone and this is one of them.

 Hilarious show with a great ending tribute

 Thoroughly Enjoyable

 Parks and Recreation reigns supreme in the sitcom comedy genre!

 To be honest...

 Not spectacular

 If you haven't seen parks and rec, you really need to

 Easy and fun to watch
