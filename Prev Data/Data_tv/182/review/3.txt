By episode three I decided not to rubber neck this train wreck of a show. But I try and be a fair guy, so I watched a few more episodes. It didn't help, in fact, I disliked it even more. While I admire Louis's decision not to score the show and style it in the old playhouse fashion, the show is depressing as hell. The total lack of any likable characters makes it dreary to the point of being disheartening. The bleak lives of the characters crushes you like a slow moving steamroller. The storyline and dialogue are so gloomy you can feel the weight of it. The acting, at times, is substantial and will lure you in. Still, however well acted certain scenes are, they only serve to ramp up the engines of despair that run throughout the show. On top of all that, Louis heaps up a generous amount of social preaching. Which tries to deliver up "All In The Family" type lessons, but falls far short. One has the sense that the awkward and forced messages are just added in to make the characters even more depressing than they already are. In my opinion, there is little reason to waste your time and emotions on this accident scene.
