 An innocent comedy movie that not just makes you laugh your hearts out but makes you think as the movie proceeds. Brilliant work done by Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan.

 A great social comedy movie

 Wrong Number, Right Film

 PK Makes The Important Points In Right Manner

 Modest, Enlightening, Hilarious and Entertaining

 Good Movie But Not as good as 3 Idiots

 Celebrate the End Of the Year With PK

 Worth a watch

 Another Raju Hirani Classic!

 RajKumar Hirani again rock after 5 years with PK

 PK<U+0085>. - Bas Theek Hai<U+0085>

 Meaningfully Funny. Sarcastic Approach Makes it funnier but Content

 Awesome

 Refreshing Change in Indian Cinema, Absolutely Wonderful!

 P.K. was much needed

 A brave attempt with a very strong social message. ( 8/10 )

 "Looks like the phone lines to God have gone kaput..."

 Great movie.

 Slightly bordering fictional but makes one think practically

 PK travels his journey, and invites you to go on yours

 AK rocks as PK

 PK makes you to think, PK makes you laugh, PK makes you cry

 Rib Tickling Message Oriented Movie

 Crazy movie

 PK is a daring attempt which should be lauded and appreciated for its wonderful message
