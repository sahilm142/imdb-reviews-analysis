After watching the first episode, I have serious concerns for the future of this series. Basically, what I was able to see is that this is a mashup of various elements from The Office, Jackass, and other shows, but unfortunately, they're taking from all the wrong elements. Nathan's dead pan humor, while I'm sure would be all the rage in the UK, just falls flat in the US. More often than not during the episode, I found myself cringing at half the stuff he was doing. The humor isn't really all that clever, and a is probably geared either to teenagers or stoners. To build on another review, this simply does seem like a Daily Show element where a field reporter is off making people uncomfortable, only moreso. I'm definitely not impressed so far, and I'm sure time is going to tell that this show isn't going to make it.
