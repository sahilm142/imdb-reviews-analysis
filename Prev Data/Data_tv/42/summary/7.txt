 Season 1: yes! Season 2: Oh no!

 Incredible 1st season, 2nd season not so flawless

 Certainly a fun watch, but certainly not 9 stars

 Should never have had a sequel

 Original story after the 4th episode

 What happened?

 Overrated.

 Good but not THAT good

 Great show but still needs a lot of improvement

 MEH

 Just watch the originals

 grab some chips, you ain't leaving seat for a while

 Is it an Homage or a Rip-Off

 Overrated in all the rule.

 impressive start but ends up cheesy at the end

 Thrilling, compelling TV -- updated

 Alright

 Revamped oldies and great cast

 Solidly built, paced, very well directed, amazing acting, but fell flat when it comes to characters and a logical plot

 It's a good show if you watch it without your brains

 Good one time watch show but just overhyped and overrated.

 Its not a 10/10 but its not a 1/10 either.

 Season 3 better get it back on track

 Awesome Start..But

 High school horror show that could have been more
