 a symphony in film

 Leon is another amazing movie that adds to one of cinemas greatest years, 1994!

 Overrated at 8.6 !

 Milk.

 Some things I liked some I did not.

 A much more tender affair than you'd expect.

 Suspend belief, an in incredibly absurb amount of belief

 TRUST

 Quietly impressive.

 Good for an action film

 "I like these calm little moments before the storm".

 Good but #27?! I just don't get it.

 Misunderstood

 4 Different Movies

 Interesting and intense

 Cult status is well deserved

 A weird but good film

 Enjoyable film

 Good

 Killed by bad writing

 Worth adding to "To Watch" list, but not amazing

 Moody and exciting, coolly defiant...but ultimately dispiriting

 The hit-man and her.

 Not an Usual Hit-man

 A fluke
