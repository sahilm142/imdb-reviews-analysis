 Psudo intellectual dribble...

 A good video game commercial disguised as a terrible movie

 Postmodern filmmaking at its worst

 It's all effects

 you either love it or hate it...and I hate it!

 Appalling rubbish - apart from the special fx

 I Guess If You Have Never Met Anyone Who HAD A Mind . . .

 Unoriginal and uninspired!

 Great SFX, Pants film

 I guess I just don't get it

 Failure of sequel not a surprise - since original wasn't anything special to me..

 There is no spoon(and by spoon I mean plot)

 Unfathomably overrated

 Don't believe the hype, The Matrix is horrible.

 Overrated and brimming with convenience

 Whoa...!

 Good, but...

 Filler, filler and more filler. Did I mention bad acting too?

 Where was the story ?

 Yawn!

 over rated rubbish

 What were they thinking!!!

 Not a film

 My big disappointment
