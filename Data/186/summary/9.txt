 The Truman Show as a Satire

 Review of and Satirical Techniques in The Truman Show

 Makes you think about your purpose in life.

 Great humor, greater discussion

 About a man named Truman who has a great life but is not happy with it. He wants to figure out why he is unhappy.

 Unforgettable

 Easily one of the most unique ideas I have ever seen

 A story that will remain you seated till the last point.

 Brilliant

 This is not a comedy guys!

 A good movie for TV show Lovers

 Despite its 1998 release, the message still holds true two decades later

 one of my favorite film

 An engrossing look at an exploited man...

 Film questioning the reality perception

 it's a thin line between being crazy and a genius
