It used to be a punchline that more people got their news from THE DAILY SHOW (and by extension, THE COLBERT REPORT), but that's the only way to watch the news these days. Joel McHale provides the same service on THE SOUP with regard to all of the trash TV that's out there. The good news is that THE COLBERT REPORT is just as entertaining. If anyone on TV deserves to be mocked, it's talking head "personalities", and Stephen Colbert lambasts the worst of them. I love the self-absorbed dimwit character he's created, and self-aggrandizing has never been so funny. The jokes on this show always seem to hit their mark, and that he's always willing to go to such smartass lengths makes him all the more endearing. Even before I started tuning in, I knew about the SuperPac, Colbchella, and "Truthiness". The show made its impression on pop culture and there's no escaping it. I'm not sure why it took me so long to give this show a chance, and it's sad that we only have two more months of this comedic talent. One thing's for certain: when Stephen Colbert leaves in December, he'll leave a serious void in the TV landscape. Funniest man in late-night, absolutely. 9/10


                
Colbert's commentary is just on point. You can't get anything past him! And his comedic timing is priceless
