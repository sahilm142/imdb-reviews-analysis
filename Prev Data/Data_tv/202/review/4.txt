Ash vs the Evil Dead the TV series is just as campy and cheesy as the second movie and tries really hard to be as funny as Army of Darkness. The problem is that the acting is atrocious even for a Bruce Campbell venue. I was so looking forward to this show. I will give it a few episodes to see if it gets better but some times you just have to let a classic die before something comes along and ruins it.... I must admit that the final scene was the best when Ash was fighting the deadites. I was disappointed to find him working at Value shop and not S Mart. I mean what kind of logo can you come up with for Value Shop. There is no topping Shop Smart, Shop S-Mart.
