I gave this show entire season's worth a benefit of the doubt. What I saw was a dull, super grim, ultra nihilistic, cliched and joyless excercise in tedium that made me dislike it more with each episode. Nearly every damn character is an irredeemable one dimensional piece of trash and an imbecile to boot. The only possible enjoyment there is to get out of this is seeing them murdered. But of course, the biggest scumbag is left standing by the end of first season thanks to all his enemies conveniently acting like complete morons. This show is not interested in saying anything new about the life it depicts, it only follows same tired cliches of predictable betrayals. It amazes me that so many people think this trash is anywhere close to quality of "The Sopranos", let alone it being better.
