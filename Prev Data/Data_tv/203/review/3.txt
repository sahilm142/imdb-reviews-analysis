in spite of an impressive ensemble the community show to me felt like a worst case scenario of unimaginative and impersonal humor. The writing was clichéd, shallow and unimaginative to a degree where it felt annoying - and while some of the actors may cause an occasional smile on your face it will quickly turn to a frown as characters are reduced to flat puppets. I for one found myself struggling just to get past the 3 first episodes of season 1... each one a more one-dimensional, uninspiring and downright dull piece of American standard 'we're so wacky' comedy than the previous one...In the end Community comes across as a feeble attempt of imitating the pace and style of a great show like Scrubs - but in spite of a far more favorable comedic setting (college) the show fails in every respect in terms of delivery and doesn't even compare to its counterpart...How and why this show has a rating above 5 on IMDb is an utter mystery to me and seriously challenges the credibility of the IMDb comedy audience seriously praising this. It must be a testament to a crowd of fans willing to settle for less than average as great... combined with bought votes to keep the show afloat.What I saw was however so unbelievably unimaginative that I'd rather eat a bowl of razors than watching another episode! Don't waste your life on this...
