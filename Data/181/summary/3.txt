 Okay the first time, looks worse after the second viewing...

 Collection of classic thriller clichés

 Might as well join in the fun

 Ouch!

 Spielberg Ruins a Great Story

 Not Made to Last

 Good thing this film had some dinosaurs in it, otherwise what a bore.

 How did they know so much about the dinos?

 Nothing HAPPENS in this movie!

 Very Disappointing

 Laura Dern's facial expressions really annoyed me

 A BIG movie, but not one I enjoyed

 I thought I was going to become fossilized watching this.

 I still do not understand all of the hype

 It works if You are a ten-year-old dino-freak

 Fir kids who live in 90's

 nothing special at all
