 One of the great anti-war movies.

 The Great War before the hysteria of the 1960s

 Riveting and well-acted

 Actor manipulator

 A Early Masterpiece by the Genius Filmmaker

 Very compelling anti-war film

 War, humans and dehumanizing

 Vanity fails

 An anti-war film, ahead of its time

 A Solid Film, Though In My Opinion Not Kubrick's Best

 Powerful look at men in battle under trench warfare...

 Kubrick is master of his craft, but the overall result is second-rate, especially by his standards

 A powerful portrait of injustice
