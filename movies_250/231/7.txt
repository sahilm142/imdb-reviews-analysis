I expect that Criterion films are of certain importance. They are films that have something unique to offer. Even Armageddon deserves a certain amount of recognition. It documents the way that blockbusters are going nowadays.I can honestly say that I think I understand the importance of Diabolique. The film was most likely incredibly innovative for the time period. I am impressed that the only shots that felt dated were the head-on driving shots, and aside from those, the direction is entirely appropriate. It does not call attention to itself, it has grace, and it is not feel like it has been copied since. The script is tightly written, no lines are wasted.On a personal level, I felt a little disappointed. I figured out the ending very quickly. My father, who would have been 16 when this was released, had no idea the ending was coming at all. The originality of this ending has been sacked by modern thrillers, horrors, and dramas. Regardless of deciphering the ending, this is still worth watching, even for historical purposes.


                
A personal recollection: 'Life' magazine (only those of a certain vintage will remember Life magazine) came out with a heavy-duty spread on this flick when it was released, hailing it as perhaps the most frightening movie ever made (remember the film industry wasn't as old then as it is today). I was nine years old and I begged and pleaded with my parents to be allowed to see it, to no avail. I did not get a chance to see it until much later in life, when it showed up on television. By then 'Psycho' and its successors had pushed the envelope of screen horror beyond what this film gives us. Still, the movie stands up pretty damn well on the creepiness scale. It is interesting to know that Hitchcock wanted the rights to this, and intriguing to imagine what he would have done with it. It's interesting to note that the film makers were not above providing some comic relief, in the form of the landlord and his wife in the boarding house where the murder takes place. Well worth viewing, in spite of the trouble of reading subtitles.


                
The were several possible solutions which occurred to me. One of them was as filmed. Another was the obvious ghost solution.But another possibility was that the body was actually found and quietly reported to the police. Then the ex-commissioner set a trap for the two women, who were obvious suspects because of the abuse. The traps the police used to check the ID of the naked body seemed to support this. It could have easily been the ex-commissioner who had the suit dry-cleaned and sent to the women. It was obvious that the suit was meant to scare the women. And he finally did get a confession, though his reaction showed that this wasn't the solution chosen.SPOILER: Actually, the movie's solution has a flaw, since it depends on the wife not checking that he is really dead, something they could not be certain of.The best part was at the very end, where it seems clear that the wife isn't really dead, and is giving payback. I hope she succeeds.
This movie is a wonderful thriller about an abused wife and a mistreated mistress who team up to kill the brutal husband. Their plot at first seems like a perfect crime, but then complications start appearing. From the start, the wife's remorse risks revealing the crime, particularly after an inspector shows up. Then the husband's corpse disappears. The mystery and tension build up through the entire film, all the way to the conclusion.The flaws are quite minor, because they don't detract from the suspense at all. One problem is that the ending was a bit too abrupt. An extra minute or two of denouement would have helped.Another problem is that a few early clues in the movie were presented in a way that went a bit too far in misdirecting viewers away from the correct conclusion. A good mystery needs some red herrings, but one should have a bit more chance of recognizing them as misdirection. It would be an inexcusable spoiler to reveal the false clues, avoiding spoilers makes it difficult to explain which clue I mean to those who have seen the movie.A nice touch at the end of the movie is that it has a request on screen asking viewers not to reveal the movie's secrets to people who haven't seen it. It is said to be the first movie to have included such a request.I saw the Criterion DVD version. I'm pleased they selected it, because that's one thing that led me to watch the movie. In spite of the minor flaws I noted, the movie is a suspense classic.
Probably the film that had the most influence of Psycho, Les Diaboliques centres on 2 women who decide to murder a headmaster who has wronged both of them. However, the corpse disappears and both women start going mad. LD is an older example of a horror film before the days of remake mania and endless gore and screaming. This is one unnerving thriller. Like films such as Touch Of Evil, The Artist or The Prestige it's a good film but it is overrated. It doesn't feel as creepy as Psycho, for example, and the characters are fairly dull. It's also too long and slow. Build up is the key to suspense, but if you keep putting off the catalyst for the story and then keep dragging the story out the suspense dies down on its own. It's not as creepy or suspenseful as it's made out to be but there is still a high scare factor to the film. It's undeniably a chilling and well made horror film which is patient and unpredictable unlike most of its kind.The direction isn't up there with Alfred Hitchcock but it's a well done movie with plenty of suspenseful moments. The script is pretty ordinary but like many screenplays it has some interesting dialogue and gets the job done without being massively interesting. The acting's pretty good and the depictions of characters going mad are frightening and convincing. I guessed the twist ending before the end but it's a powerful ending which just about makes sense. There are many bits where nothing much is happening, but a lot of the time the film is pretty spooky and you never really know what's coming next. The finale is well done and is one of those watch through your fingers moments. This is an effective suspense thriller overall and good enough, but it shouldn't really be compared to Psycho. It's something France can be proud off overall and should certainly be picked over most recent horror flicks.7/10


                
This movie boasts a story with a surprising twist. I could see this formula used in later T.V. serials as a solid thrill tale.Despite this, I felt I wasn't left on edge throughout the unfolding events. Though well-written, I felt a sense of being dragged on, up until the final twist, which I honestly did not see coming. But despite the unpredictableness of the ending, I could not connect with the two leads as I was always thinking they did something wrong. They were never developed fully in the protagonists I would've liked to see, and that I have seen in other suspense thrillers.Though for its time, Diabolique enjoyed some mainstream success for being a movie of macabre (something that outside of perhaps Hitchcock films, was not something done too often). I can appreciate the movie for that.


                
This 1955 French film stars Simone Signoret, Vera Clouzot, and Paul Meurisse. It is set in a boarding school which is being run into the ground by Headmaster Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). Delasalle is married (his wife, Christina, is played by Clouzot) and has a mistress (Nicole Horner, played by Signoret) who also teaches at the school. The two other teachers at the school, the doorkeeper, the students, and sundry others can't stand the cad. Delassalle refuses to spend money on maintenance, decent food, and - horror of horrors for the French - good wine.Delassalle is a despicable lout, and his wife and mistress decide to murder him. Signoret takes the lead and comes up with a credible plan giving them an alibi, and it goes off with those little hitches that keep you on the edge of your seat as you wait for various interlopers to discover the secret in the large wicker basket.Once they've successfully carried out their plan, things go horribly wrong. The body disappears. The two murderers can't figure out where it went. Then Delassalle's suit is delivered by the dry cleaners. The two women get hints and clues, but they can't figure out who is out to blackmail them. The tension is really well done, subtly played by the actors and realistic. Signoret would have been perfect in a Hitchcock movie as the cold blooded "ice blonde" that Hitch preferred. As the tension builds, the two conspirators begin to fall to pieces and their relationship frays, then breaks. Everything that can go wrong does: a body is discovered in the Seine, but it's not Delasalle's. When Christina goes to the morgue, a detective sees her and offers to solve the missing husband case for her - and he won't take no for an answer.The three actors were excellent. Meurisse captures the cruel coldness of Delasalle with fleeting expressions across his face that told more than dialogue. Clouzot was small and weak, well-cast as the invalid wife of the headmaster. But Signoret took center stage. While Christina was mousy and dark-haired, Nicole was man-sized and blonde, had plans, and executed them. As the tension mounts and they begin bickering, their relationship takes on overtones of a married couple.The pacing of the film is decidedly Fifties, but bear with it. It soon picks up, and the relationship and tension between to two women is very well done.The plot was based on a novel, and it was later made into 1996's "Diabolique," with Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, and Chazz Palminteri. I haven't seen that version. Instead, I'd recommend "Mademoiselle" with Jeanne Moreau if you like "Les diaboliques." Another teacher at a school in a small town runs amok.
There were two different reasons that led me to Les Diaboliques. One, it was made by the film-maker who was called the French Hitchcock, and two, he had also made the brilliant Wages of Fear. If he was indeed their Hitchcock, this is his Vertigo. A cruel man doesn't foresee trouble coming from both his demure wife and a sultry mistress. The wife and the mistress don't foresee trouble coming from somewhere else. Like good thrillers, much of the film works on the tension that gets created in our minds. We guess every next move by the characters and invariably are left surprised by the actual outcome. For a film that is quite scary when it wants to be, not a drop of blood is spilt. An amazingly tight script keeps you missing a beat every once in a while. This is an extraordinary achievement, and even 50+ years post its release, still is a must-see.


                
Paul Meurisse runs a boarding school for boys in 1950s Paris. He's sarcastic and mean. His wife, Vera Clouzot, teaches at the school. (He beats her and rapes her.) His mistress, Simone Signoret, also teaches there, but she hates her lover. Signoret is strong willed, while Clouzot is weak, but they nevertheless join forces to dispose of their mutual tormentor, Meurisse.The two women arrange to be at Signoret's apartment in Noirt, a town hours from Paris, and taunt Meurisse into making an angry, impromptu visit. The conspirators drug him, then drown him in the bath tub. They manage to pack him into a large wicker trunk, haul him down to their car, drive back to the school, dump his corpse into the school's murky swimming pool, and show up on time for their classes.Then the problems begin. A day or two passes and -- no corpse rises to the surface. The women are forced to drain the pool on a pretext and -- nothing but leaves, algae, and mud.Strange incidents keep cropping up. The suit Paul wore is delivered from the dry cleaners but the lead is a dead end. A private investigator shows up and begins poking around. A drowned body in the Seine turns out not to be Paul, as the women had hoped. A student swears that Paul remonstrated with him and confiscated his slingshot, which later turns up in the office.Medical discretion precludes further revelations concerning the plot.It's a well-done murder mystery, full of tension and thrills, a successful commercial enterprise. Inevitably it will be compared to Hitchcock, and it should be. The story is the sort that might have attracted either of them -- murder, guilt, suspense. But the directorial styles are different, with Clouzot's being more traditional. There are few point-of-view shots, for instance. Here we see everything "objectively." The camera doesn't linger over a plate of food. We identify with none of the characters, all of whom are evil in one or another sense. And Clouzot doesn't bash anybody's MOTHER.Nice job by all concerned, including Henri Clouzot's wife, Vera. Imagine if the movie had been made by Herbert J. Yates at Republic, a guy who also insisted on starring his wife Vera.
This is a great film, but only because i know it was made before so many great films that have come out since. That to be honest, are better than this.I can imagine how shocking the ending must have been, but having seen hundreds of films since, i felt i had seen it all before, and i guessed the twist pretty quick, and spent the rest of the film hoping i was wrong.But this film is still relevant today, as it pays attention to details that most films ignore. Creating the atmosphere only a few films have managed to do since, like rosemary's baby, not many films in the last 20 - 30 years have done this, as there's no blood, no gore, just tension, and suspense.


                
Much as I admire the morbid and fascinating melodrama of DIABOLIQUE--and it IS "morbid", an adjective I don't find among these many reviews here at IMDb--I am convinced that the film would have been even more enjoyable under Alfred Hitchcock's direction, since he would have injected some ironic and much needed humor among all the plot contrivances of the dark story. There is hardly a trace of humor in the entire film, so bleak is the storyline and so intense are the performances of SIMONE SIGNORET and VERA CLOUZOT.*****POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD***** Don't read the following paragraph if you haven't yet seen the film.And there are flaws in the ending, especially the bathtub sequence where perfect timing had to be of utmost importance to make us believe the scene could have actually gone off so perfectly. I can't say more without revealing a key plot element that would spoil the film for anyone not familiar with the story.*****END OF SPOILER ALERT***** The French atmosphere of the boarding school where Signoret and Clouzot teach is well realized, as are all the darker elements of the story which begins when Clouzot's wish to get away from the harsh cruelty of her husband develops into a conspiracy plot with Signoret to set up a murder by drowning him in a tub and disposing of the body in the school's swimming pool.Naturally, nothing goes according to plan and the suspense lies in watching how Clouzot suffers agonies of fear over discovery of the act, especially when an inquisitive police inspector gets onto the case after she visits a morgue to check on the deceased man's identification. After that, he doggedly follows her around trying to solve the man's disappearance.It's all morbidly fascinating and you won't be able to turn away from the last fifteen minutes, during which time the director toys with the audience expectations to the nth degree and provides a final twist that you may or may not find acceptable as far as logic goes.


                
The twist ending to Les Diaboliques has been imitated and ripped off so many times that by now modern audiences can pinpoint its existence fairly easily, but back in 1955 it was ripe and fresh in the imagination. If great movies stand the test of time, then Les Diaboliques may not fit that particular criteria. Henri-Georges Clouzot, dismissed by his New Wave compatriots, dealt predominantly in thrillers and is most known for his previous feature before this one, The Wages of Fear. In Wages he allots nearly half of the film in setting up his protagonists and their dead-end setting of Las Piedras, connected to the rest of the world not by plane or road but jungle pathways, tar pits and precarious wooden supports atop rocky cliffs. The film in its full, uncut version (the censors correctly guessed his intent) however is less a character study and more an allegorical jab at the capitalist system that forces the workers into their corners. Clouzot spends the first hour defining them, but the next holding them at arm's length because of the broader message - William Friedkin's remake, Sorcerer, allocates each strand of the story its own separate introduction but falls to the same error. The ending, a deeply ironic sequence juxtaposing the merry waltz of the naive lover and the askew existentialism of Mario is a cheap parting shot at the low hanging fruit of Hollywood. But the scenarios beforehand show Clouzot to be a master of constructing tension, even for characters with fuzzy and undefined pasts. His scenes rightfully are not scored, leaving only the natural sounds of the environment to be magnified and exaggerated in the minds of those who traverse them. Each chilling incident in Les Diaboliques relies on the paranoia of Christina to elevate curiosity into fear; elsewhere the tone is casually cheery as the rest of the school's inhabitants discuss the events in passing. Clouzot's objectiveness, then, is justified. He doesn't dip into the sub-conscious like Hitchcock might; everything is shot matter-of-fact, with no POVs, and the selective closeups merely show what is there to be seen. Though a few moments reveal noir and expressionist imagery, it scarcely reaches the heights of puzzles such as Vertigo (the intensity of associative colour and the dizziness of the dolly zoom) or Rebecca (the overwrought set design and the camera tracing ghostly movement). All its elements are able to be rationalised by Fichet, who enters jarringly as the pipe-wielding Holmes figure, also possessing similar levels of superhuman deduction. If the retired police chief carries himself with amusement and seems to relish watching them squirm, it is a symptom of Christina's guilt closing in on her own conscience. The building of the mystery follows this same line of thought: we don't see the splotchy clue in the picture that might be a resurrected Michel, but merely her horrified reaction. When she sits up in bed in her white nightgown like a tucked-in child, a slimy hand reaches out from the shrouds of darkness to grab at her - it's merely Fichet, who has more questions and queries for her. Everything is inferred through her mind, and so gloves left at a typewriter, jostling sounds from the bathroom and a sliver of white light snaking through a crack in the doors all become terrifying, in her eyes and so too in ours. Véra Clouzot is the best of the actors. She has the bodily posture of a wooden board, like the stiff, frigid, battered woman she has become in the subjugation of her marriage. The conversations with her husband are not equal duels; each of his sneering insults must be fended off, and at times she seems to be bracing knowingly for impact before she even is slapped. While some might question the logic of a mistress banding together with the wife, here is a character who does not question such things because she has been bruised long enough that any relief is an opportunity immediately seized. She never stops to consider that Nicole, her masculine opposite, might have an ulterior motive every bit as filthy as the opening credits shot of the muddy pool. Clouzot assigns an anti-spoiler warning to maintain this logical twist ending (a move first utilised by Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, and later in the same vein with Hitchcock's Psycho). But he also throws a final spanner in the works. Having revealed all the answers he slips one last puzzle in: perhaps Christina did not die of a heart attack after all, and is still lurking the halls of the boarding school. Having pulled off the bait and switch, Clouzot can't bear to waste all the buildup of the supernatural and fantastical. It's like having your cake and eating it too.
