 The Battle's In The Writing

 Great message

 Season 2 keeps things fresh with original and unpredictable storylines

 Meet Earn. A young man likely who was the golden child of his family, but now is a borderline deadbeat trying to make something out of himself.

 One of the best shows of 2016

 S1E7 was the best and I want more of that.

 Atlanta (Season 2) - Wonderful Cast, Solid Writing

 Fresh Real Outlook for a television show.

 I Really Like This So Far

 It works in so many levels
