 Earnest Adaptation of Classic Marvel Comic

 One of the greatest-ever animated superhero shows!

 Outstandingly good!!!

 Great show

 X-Appeal

 Excellent, more faithful to the comics than the mediocre films ever will be

 A great animated series, a tribute to the comics

 One of the best shows ever

 Faithful To The Original Comic Book Series, Though Superior To The Films Themselves

 Epic

 X-tremely X-cellent Cool Series!

 A classic cartoon about Marvel comic's team of mutant's called the X-men led by professor X, fighting for peace even if it means protecting those who hate them.

 The perfect animated series ever!

 definitely flawed, but a good, solid effort

 Bruce Timm's DCAU has probably spoiled me.

 One of my favourite shows as a kid and still is

 This was a very good series

 plays great to kids, but the adults can join in the danger and fun too

 The greatest X-Men Anthology ever made...

 Classic!

 The best retelling of the X-Men comics made.

 This could have been a genre-defining series...

 Overrated and Childish

 Vastly inferior to the WB Batman & Superman toons.
