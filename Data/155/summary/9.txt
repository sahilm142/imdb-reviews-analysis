 Still outshines the others 17 years later

 Timeless

 New Blu-Ray Disc Made Me A Blade Runner Fan

 Fantastical

 Ridley Scott at his best.

 Blade Runner is amazing

 One to re-watch over and over...

 Cyber-punk classic that will last the test of time.....

 Saw this again 35 years later after just seeing Blade Runner 2049

 Like Tears in Rain...

 Blade Runner - Review

 An excellent genre mash-up

 Blade Runner: The Final Cut

 Beautiful, atmospheric, thought-provoking.

 A Real Science Fiction

 Firstly, and above all a visual experience

 This film is genius

 Tears in rain, in a city that never stops weeping

 A Really Good Movie But It Has A Couple of Flaws

 Regarding Director's Cut, and other comments

 20 years later, it still delivers !

 The best movie ever!

 "I've seen things..."

 One of the last specimens of the pure art in cinematography

 80s cyberpunk piece sees visionary Ridley Scott taking Phillip K. Dick's inspiring source material and spinning into cinematic mastery
