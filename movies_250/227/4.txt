I can imagine recommending this movie to someone taking or teaching a class on civil disobedience or Indian history. It's not without its emotionally harrowing moments and inspirational wisdom, but the movie itself just isn't nearly as interesting or as revolutionary as its subject. SIDE NOTE: what an odd period in cinema, when black-face was allowed as long as it was "respectful"....Kingsley is great, but still...
