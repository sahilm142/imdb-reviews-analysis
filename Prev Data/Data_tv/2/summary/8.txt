 Excellent adaptation of an amazing book, with some notable flaws

 Well worth the hype

 George I miss you!

 Impressive epic with plenty of violence , fierce combats , plot twists , gore and blood .

 The uproar on the internet intrigued me.

 Nothing Quiet Like It

 Very fast pace but loyal to book

 Quality HBO production

 Possibly the worst storyline I will ever encounter...

 Outstanding TV Series.

 I can't understand the popularity of this series.

 Quite bad actually

 Unjustified negativity

 Once again, skip these idiot reviews and watch for yourself.

 One of my favorite series.

 really good , until...

 Fantastic first season but losing interest due to character deaths and scattered story lines.

 Nice Show, But Sorry never come close to Breaking Bad.

 Only a handful of gripes, overall excellent

 Wonderful, elaborate storytelling

 Why season 7 why

 Masterpiece!!

 You can feel the writers have changed

 I haven't read the books

 Great show
