 Are you not entertained?

 Spartacus Blood and Sand

 A great show that brings the blood

 So good..

 Epic series.

 I really hate it when good series turn into soap operas

 Completely Epic

 Hey, this is actually good

 Sparticus Sands of Time - Rocks

 Full on violence /sex /gore /slow motion fights

 An elegant foray of blood and damnation

 Order

 Brutal

 Beyond any expectation (in a good way)!!!!

 Epic.

 Makes 24 and Lost look a thing of the past Fantastic!!

 Just my favourite show right now

 This show is extremely pornographic!

 Good but Liam McIntyre wrongly casted as Spartacus

 Better than ever

 The future seasons (if they ever come out) may be disappointing to their audience

 Much better as it goes along

 Soft-core porno with a good story

 Ancient History Brought to Life

 What is beneath your feet !?
