is everyone in this movie. And violent. For the sake of it.I am not one to be squeamish about blood, or violence, even if it is not justified or is a little bit for the sake of it, as here. Sadly, the problem with the movie is not even that it glorifies it all (it would be horrible to live in a society so violent and hypocritical as the one depicted in the movie... oh...).The problems with "Relatos salvajes" are two. One, it is not original. It has been done hundred times. And better. The violence, the short stories, people breaking under stress, the sarcastic, cynical, tongue-in-cheek tone, the last "twist". The random sex. And two, and one that could be forgivable if it was original, it thinks too high of itself, it thinks that is way smarter than it really is.For some people, this movie could be a surprise, and that is great. But every punchline, surprise, or development is obvious, not surprising and boring.
