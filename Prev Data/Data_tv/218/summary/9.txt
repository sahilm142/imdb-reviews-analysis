 Faith & The Carnivale

 One of the best character-driven, convincing, plot twisting series that's ever been aired

 Truly a masterpiece - please HBO, it's been 7 years now, it's time to produce the last 4 seasons...

 Bring back Carnivale. Bring it back!

 Riviting--I couldn't stop watching

 Taking us to the Dust Bowl era

 Ambitious

 3rd season

 As it said in the trivia it ended with so many unanswered questions

 An excellent plot, worthwhile to watch it.
