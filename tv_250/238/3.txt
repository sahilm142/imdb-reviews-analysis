Another one pointless TV show. Creators even did not hear about sophisticated character or interesting plot.I don't know why people give for this title so high marks. How always people just take a pity on lgbtq and aids themes.The plot is very predictable, just look on a ball's marks: amount of points in most important battles is different only on ONE (what a triumphant victory of "good" house against "evil" house. And it's almost in every episode). Boring to death drag battles, aids cry scenes, trivial prostitute love with client and some FRIENDSHIP and FAMILY also in trivial style.Watch, if you like to waste your time.
