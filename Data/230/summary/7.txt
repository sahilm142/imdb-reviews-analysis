 Didn't do much for me

 Worth a Watch ... If you're a movie buff

 Do The Right Thing

 a film that points out inner-city social fragmentation that can be appreciated worldwide

 Disappointed yet my day wasn't ruined

 Extremely advisable to all teenagers and young adults (and not only)

 a Jew, an Arab and an African

 An intense atmosphere and story with good acting.

 Hate, French Style

 Captures the ethnic friction in Paris

 Overrated, but certainly watchable
