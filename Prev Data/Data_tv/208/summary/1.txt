 Marriage Is Dead, Long Live Love

 One of Bergman's most interesting works as a director and one of Ullman/Josephson's very best

 Sometimes hard to take, but unbearably wise

 The Tragedy of Emotional Illiteracy (Review is about the 5 Hour Version)

 Bergman's Version of a Cage Match

 My second favorite movie of all time

 dissects the complexity of human relationships as an almost unbearable shrine to honesty

 Another Ingmar Bergman`s Masterpiece

 Compelling drama with a brilliant performance by Liv Ullmann

 Stunningly authentic

 At once poignant, considered, bitter, painfully insightful

 A Meaningful Film

 an outwardly happy couple married for ten years face their repressed turmoil when husband finds another lover and leave the wife with unanswered questions

 Love in a cold climate

 Impossible, impeccable

 A deeply moving, delicately felt look at real love, true love

 Bergman's Masterpiece

 The long version is the way to go

 Disturbing film worth the considerable effort it takes to watch.

 Love, Trust, Partnership, Tolerance and Tenacity, the Order Always Changing

 An emotionally draining film experience

 Where marriage is either a hell of a ride, or a ride to hell.

 A marriage falls apart in Ingmar Bergman's intimate portrait of two people who love and hate each other; a rich experience

 Monumental

 A Look at Marriage Without the Romance
