I never thought the film could be so boring. Perhaps it is because I watch the 208 minutes director's cut version, rather than the original theatrical release version with 150 minutes. For the director's cut version, it is total rubbish. The pace is extremely slow and many scenes are just repetitive. The terror and despair scenes of the soldiers are shown again and again. The director wants the audience to have pity on the Nazi soldiers? No way! They start the war, and they deserve to lose the war.The only merit of the movie is that the ending is beyond expectation and cliché. So the rating for this movie is 2/10.
