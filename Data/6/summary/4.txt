 One of the most boring movies of all time

 Schindler's List is a beautiful drama and one of the greatest movies ever made

 easily one of the greatest films ever!

 The Truth

 There are pieces of a good movie here, it's just not a good movie

 the Holocaust in three conveniant acts

 A Holocaust Movie without an understanding of the Holocaust ...

 An Over-hyped Crawling Drama

 Another Overbaked Spielberg Production

 Mediocre and overrated

 Hard to Watch

 Exploitive and pandering, watch "The Pianist" for an excellent Holocaust film

 Not as good as the reviews make it seem

 There are better holocaust movies.

 Good, but extremely overrated.

 Vastly overrated.

 Oh, please

 Memorable film of Jewish oppression during WWII
