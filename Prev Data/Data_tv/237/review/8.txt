So happy Queen Eye is back. I was hesitant to give the new series a try but am happy to say, I'm loving it! The fab five are amazing, caring, diverse, and entertaining to say the least. The show is like a big warm hug and has me laughing, crying, and squeeling every episode. Well done!


                
I absolutely love this show. It isn't something that I would pick out to watch, but my daughter said to try it, so I was like...why not. I love all 5 guys. They are so beautiful inside and out. My favorites are Jonathan and Tan, but I love all 5. There were times when I was thinking they will not be able to help this one/guy, but in the end they helped each and every one of them. I cried and laughed and cried again. A couple of times I even got goosebumps. They're ability to figure out what each of theses guys needed was spot on, and the sincerity of their delivery enabled them to reach each and every guy they helped. This is truly a heartwarming show and I can't wait until season 2.


                
I'm gay and I'm happy. Also, I need Tan and Antoni to marry me.
One thing though: Bobby sure loves blue.


                
This episode just tore me up. So sweet and kindhearted. I love these guys and heading their backstories and how they relate to the people they visit.
