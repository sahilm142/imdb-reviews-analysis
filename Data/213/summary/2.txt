 Well that was bleak.

 Lost 137 minutes of my life

 Dark and depressing movie

 Rest in Peace???

 I found the movie depressing

 Sorry, but this is absurd

 As an X-men fan I was very disappointed

 Instead of this see...

 truly sad

 Little girl goes on killing spree - disturbing

 worst X-men movie ever

 Dark & gritty...

 Would be great if it were not a sequel in a long-running franchise

 Swearing and too violent

 Boring AF

 This should be an "X Rated" Horror Movie

 It was different than other Marvel films

 Huge disappointment

 An Honest Review

 Worst piece of ...

 Great acting could not save a bad storyline

 "THE" crucifixion of "THE Superhero", Watch him die a dogs death. Duh, Feel sympathy for the brave warrior !!

 Movie Title is Deceptive

 Huge disappointment

 why would you kill an iconic figure
