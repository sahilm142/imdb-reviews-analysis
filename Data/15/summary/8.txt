 A visual masterpiece and better than the first

 Is It Magical?

 I rally wanted to love this movie.

 The Weakest Link - a spoiler or two

 Good but not the best

 Enjoyable

 Disappointing

 Pretty darned good but...

 A very very good film! Perhaps not as good as Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King

 Scary, Action-Packed, Eye-Popping Second Film In The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy

 confusing but enjoyable

 after the Fellowship, this was a bit of a disappointment

 Much better than FOTR

 Epic scenes save Towers

 Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is so precious, but gees, it's a hard film to get through.

 Great second edition to the franchise

 Gorgeous To Look At, But Not Quite Perfect

 great

 10Words - The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

 It suffers due to its transitional status, becoming unfocused and meandering; there are a few stand-out scenes, though, and it is still entertaining.

 Epic!

 A well-rounded and fast-paced movie with great action

 Storyline is on point

 The Two Towers

 I think this movie was not so good as first part.
