 "Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while."

 A personal favorite, but mediocre. The whole greater than the sum of its parts.

 Inigo Montoya saves the day!

 "You killed my father, prepare to die"

 Princess Bride-- A fantastical enjoyed ADVENTURE

 A SLEEPER HIT

 The inspiration for so many later blockbusters.

 "Poor and perfect"

 Charming little fantasy adventure.

 Charming and funny with a wide audience appeal................

 Above average fantasy movie with straight-forward action, sword-fights, and lots of monsters

 Pretty good if you look at it from the witty entertainment angle

 B for budget, A for fun

 The Ultimate Fantasy Movie?

 An enjoyable (and extremely quotable) fairy tale, but still less than the sum of its parts

 Good action movie

 Quick Reviews!!

 Great for kids and ol' fogies alike

 Best senseless fun, sweet, enjoyable and should watch

 Great Fairytale That's One Of Reiner's Best!

 Slightly overrated

 A gem from the 80s that still holds up well...

 Robin Wright, Kelly Capwell, Princess Buttercup... who needs grandpa?

 GREAT movie for kids and a classic

 Definitely Worth a Look
