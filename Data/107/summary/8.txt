 A classic in every aspect.

 Awe-inspiring, classic western by one of my favorite directors. QT fans, this is the trilogy he got his inspiration from.

 Stylish , violent , laconic Western and very well shot by the great Leone

 "Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had it's price."

 Were You Ever Young ?

 This is not a spaghetti, it is a caviar western.

 Fine western from Sergio Leone

 Really enjoyable. Beautifully crafted, bits of it took my breath away

 Much better than a Fistful of Dollars

 A fantastic Western

 "Thought I was having trouble with my adding. It's all right now."

 Alive or dead? It's your choice.

 While there's nothing here quite as intense as the first's final showdown, this one is just a lot more fun.

 For a Few Dollars More<U+0085>. we'll kick in a free poncho

 A good warm up to "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"

 Exciting, larger than life and a true classic

 When the chimes end, pick up your gun. Go ahead and shoot me Colonel. Just try.

 The template Spaghetti Western

 Lee Van Cleef would kick Chuck Norris' ass

 A worthwhile Western--for a few dollars less, to boot!

 The near perfect western

 Greatness

 "Manco" the one-handed

 Did you expected anything less from a Sergio Leone western?

 A classic among classics.
