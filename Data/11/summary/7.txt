 ...Is it okay if I say it's slightly overrated?

 Good movie but not the masterpiece it's being hailed as---7/10

 Masterpiece of visuals, but only visuals

 Good but could have been better.

 Good movie, too many battles

 Great story development

 Could have made much more of an impact, but man is it still something.

 Lord of the Disappointment

 The Fellowship of hard work (DVD)

 my view of the film

 Good Story, Bad Movie

 Overrated, to say the least!

 Over hyped and muddled telling of a great story.

 The Quirks of Cate's Mind

 Bored

 Probably the best of the three

 Good being the first movie

 Tolkien's adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws

 Solid, well-made fantasy movie

 Good

 It Begins.

 An ancient evil awakens and unlikely heroes arise to end it forever.

 First!

 Love that JR Tolkien

 I remember Peter Jackson
