 A film requiring patience with huge rewards for the viewer!

 Very well made

 Son los dioses quienes lloran cuando ven la torpeza de los hombres

 Noh Lear This is Noh Lear This is Noh Lear

 Epic, brilliant

 Japanese cinema at its best - a gift from Akira Kurosawa

 One of the most moving movies i have ever seen

 Kurosawa does King Lear

 They are the gods who cry when they see the folly of men

 Superb

 A late Kurosawa that is just as great as his earlier work.

 A Work of Art

 Ran

 Masterpiece

 Great movie

 Ran is Akira Kurosawa's last epic.

 Colorful Asian warfare without ninjas-on-wire trickery

 An Excellent Movie

 It all started here

 Excellent

 Master of cinema

 In a mad world only the mad are sane.

 Kurosawa's late historical masterpiece is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations out there

 Ran

 King Lear in Feudal Japan
