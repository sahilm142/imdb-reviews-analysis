 AWFUL!!

 A waste of time, film and effort

 It's Emperor's New Clothes Time!

 A weirdo, narcissistic collage of failure

 a monumental waste of time

 One of the worst movies I have seen.

 Overrated

 reprehensible

 awful execution, the most overrated movie I've ever seen

 Donnie Darko? Should have been called Donnie Dumbo

 Waste of time

 Most over-rated rubbish I've EVER watched

 I thought it was an artistically ambiguous movie at first, but nope...just a bad movie.

 Donnie Darko: Pretentiousness Personified

 This movie is pretentious trash! Get over it.

 I tried, I really did

 boring, stupid and not the least scary

 Terrible!

 What a Bust!

 I want my money back

 One of the Worst Films I have ever seen.

 Waste of time

 This movie is basically a waste

 Donnie Very Disappointing

 100% garbage
