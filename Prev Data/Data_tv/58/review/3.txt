9.2 on what scale ?? 
I have to wonder if the reviews are seeded I can not see the attraction The the two protagonists do not seem to have learnt anything in 30 years , including. acting.
12 year old mentality with 30 years of experience of kicking people in the face to solves life problems??it is a little cute and watchable, but it adds nothing


                
I feel sorry for everyone involved in this. Adults projecting what they never got over into high school onto kids. Possibly the lamest part of this though is the lame spin kick by Macchio where he almost looks like he pulled a hamstring doing it.
