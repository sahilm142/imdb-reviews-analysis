I had high hopes for this show. I'm a huge Louis CK fan, the other user reviews are glowing, and Louis himself claims it's the 'best thing he's ever written.' Man, is this show boring. It has three or four good laughs each episode (mostly provided by Alan Alda), but otherwise I felt like I was watching an amateur theater production of "My Crazy Life," or some other generic play. You can remove 15 minutes from each show, and wouldn't miss a thing. It's sloooooow. Everyone walks slow, talks slow, and moves slow. There are long stretches of unfunny dialogue, filmed in a single cut, that work well in Kevin Smith movies, but no so much for Horace and Pete. I found myself browsing on my phone during this show, just because I was getting starved for entertainment. My advice would be to watch only the 'ensemble' scenes in the bar. Fast forward whenever you see only 2 characters on the screen (usually 1/2 the show). Skip episode 3 entirely. The other glowing reviews on this site were probably written by skinny dudes who wear turtlenecks, own several cats, and don't eat meat. As a regular guy and big fan of Louis CK, I'm telling you to skip this show.
Reminiscent of old BBC teleplays but lacking in the substance they possess.
