Just watched it last night and can't help but think how much better the original "Infernal Affairs" was compare to "The Departed." The Departed had wasted its cast power, failed to fully develop the characters, failed to focus on the inner conflict for the two undercover, didn't make enough of a point in betrayal, and tried but failed to made up with Scorsess' trade mark violence and sex.I didn't feel the inner conflict of Matt Damon the same as Andy Lau. I couldn't help but feel for Jack when Matt betrayed him while I could understand Andy's inevitable turn and his trying to be a better person than he was.I couldn't feel for Leonardo. He was crying and breaking up after what? SIX MONTHs? Damn! Tony Leung was a undercover for nine years and he didn't sign up because he chose to, he signed up because that was the only way he could be a cop! Martin Sheen got shafted in his role. There was no time for his character to develop a believable relationship with Leonardo. His screen time was wasted. When he got pushed off the roof, Leonardo wasn't feeling the loss of his only life-line to the world, there was still Mark, he wasn't feeling the loss of a trusted friend, there was no friendship, he wasn't feeling the loss of a fatherly figure, and the only emotion he could have was the shock from the brutality of the murder.Mark Walhberg and Alec Baldwin got shafted, too. Mark Walhberg was reduced to a foul mouth asshole turned plot device. What do we need him for other than showing up at the end to put Matt out? Alec Baldwin? His whole highlight was to make that stupid speech about marriage at the golf course? COME ON! The only bright spot in this movie is Jack Nicholson. But even his talent is wasted because he had no one but "Mr. French" to play off his evilness. The classic scene of the original Infernal Affair had Jack's character to confront his counter part in the police station with some of the most memorable moment of the film. Jack has no counter part in "The Departed" and his brilliance was wasted. (The dock encounter was lousy with Martin Sheen making empty threats and Mark Walhberg just running his mouth off.) Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio made lousy under covers, nowhere up to the professionalism showed in the original. Even the confrontation at the end lack the power of the original with the surprise. More dead bodies and more punches and elbows actually subtracted the suspense and the confrontation. There was nothing like the psychological confrontation with the calm manner in the original. Instead, we had elbows flying and a character cracking up crying. Mark Walhberg's existence actually ruined the helplessness of Leonardo. Unlike the original, logically he didn't have to do it alone."The Departed" is a good movie if only it wasn't a remake. There is a reason it is not doing well in Hong Kong. The original is much much better plot wise and character wise. The acting was superb in both movie but the script and the direction was the difference. Even though the plot was essentially the same, Infernal Affair was a much better movie.Watch the original if you haven't seen it, and see the difference in camera work and characters.
I have loved the original (Infernal Affairs) from the first time it enthralled and enticed me into its engrossing story, and I have watched it so many times without ever losing a moments interest. When I found out it would be remade, I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces, but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts, yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York, it was entertaining, it had all the right elements to make it a great film, but after watching it, I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably, the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character, along with the fight scenes and the setting, yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves.This brings me onto 'The Departed'. I went in thinking, this should be OK, Scorsese has taken an amazing concept and is trying to make it his own with a stellar cast that with such material, really shouldn't go wrong. I was right to an extent, but I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction.Having read in reviews that Jack Nicholson stole the show, to be honest, he didn't really do much for me in the film, just his usual on screen persona (feisty, scary, loud). He fits the bill though, he took up the screen and he owned the scenes he was in. However, if you look at the original and compare it to Sam, you'll notice that Sam seemed more menacing, because you really didn't know what he was going to do or say next.Martin Sheens 'Quinan' was probably one of the weakest characters, his role in comparison to the original does not give a real mentor bonding with Billy Costigan (Leo Di Caprio) and defeats the idea of the closeness of the two main good characters. His sidekick however, Mark Wahlbergs 'Dignam', I think was the best thing in the movie. It allowed for a bit of banter and sparked off a few laughs in the cinema. He was more developed in this version, however he got in the way of Quinan making any impact on the story.The two leads were well cast, Leonardo Di Caprio does well with his role and looks frail but tough, and caught in the middle of things. Matt Damon had probably less to do, in acting terms, however he manages well with what he had. Having said this, neither of them match up to Tony Leung or Andy Lau, from the original.The one thing I did like about The Departed was the new idea that they both fall for the same woman. It added a bit more to the back story and suspense, towards the end. Overall, I gave this a 7, because it is a movie in its own right and being that, it is a pretty good offering by Scorsese. The problem is, for me, the original is far better. The whole concept, suspense and acting from Infernal Affairs is so much more believable and flowing. I think one important point to note is the environment, the Hong Kong police force and triads are much better suited for this plot, as well as the language. Scorsese did well with transferring the idea over to the S. Boston Irish 'mafia', but he failed in trying to translate a lot of the dialogue over from Cantonese (eg. the wrong way of writing the word 'bodyguard' on the envelope, changes to the misspelling of the word 'citizen').To conclude, if I was to take into account the original, I would have given this a 3.5/10, which may seem harsh, but I believe its nowhere near as good. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs and were intending on seeing The Departed, I would advise you to see the latter first, so you will know what I mean about feeling unsatisfied. I think the rating of 8.7 (at the time of writing) for The Departed does not do the original justice. I leave it for you to decide.
I was excited to see the movie because of the cast and the story. I was very disappointed after 5th minute because it is the same exact copy of the movie INFERNAL AFFAIRS '. The scenes, the story, everything is the same. I would understand if they used the story as a base and made a movie out of it but I will not accept it if the only thing they changed is the cast. I cannot make a good comment of the movie because it definitely is not a movie of it's own. There is no excitement of watching the movie because I know what would happen on every scene. I will give my vote to the actors only because their performance ( especially Leonardo Di Caprio )was very good but that's all.


                
I had massive expectations for THE DEPARTED , a violent mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese the greatest film maker in the world today . After seeing it I did have a slight of feeling of something I have experienced throughout my life - Disappointment ***** SPOILERS ******The film starts in typical Scorsese style of a sweeping framing sequence with a musical soundtrack by The Rolling Stones similar to the work he did in GOODFELLAS . Unfortunately the director doesn't sustain this and whilst never becoming mediocre we don't see much in the way of what cinematic beauty Scorsese is capable of and in several scenes most notably in the death of Queennan the original film INFERNAL AFFAIRS did it far more better THE DEPARTED suffers from a very uneven screenplay courtesy of William Monahan . When it's bad it's woeful but when it's good it's great . It should be pointed out however that when it's good it's entirely down to Siu Fia Mak's original script and if you've seen INFERNAL AFFAIRS you'll notice how tight the storytelling was and how loose and cluttered Monahan's adaptation is in comparison . Did we really need a romantic subplot ? And there seems a lack of thought put into Costello . He's spent years as a crime boss so how come it appears it's only now that the Boston police department have come up with the bright idea of putting several moles into Costello's crew ? Are we to seriously believe that Costello is being protected for < Plot revelation that I won't give away > , and just because a tough gangster likes opera that doesn't make him multi layered , it just makes him clichéd and unconvincing . Most ridiculous scene is where Costello meets his police mole in the cinema . If it's a clandestine meeting then why does Costello draw attention to himself by grunting and pulling out his penis ? Possibly the most stupid sequence I've ever seen in a Scorsese film There's been many other criticisms of this movie , a movie that seems to have split the critics right down the middle . One is the cast . I do think DiCaprio is a much better actor than what he's given credit for but I was never entirely convinced when he has to dish out violence . Someone a little less pretty should have been cast while you're left with the impression that Deniro and Pesci were first choices for Costello rather than Nicholson . Damon does merely okay as Sullivan while Ray Winstone as French is somewhat distracting because he's a widely regarded actor and household name in Britain and seeing him attempt an American accent is something of a shock to the system . The one performance I wasn't keen on was Mark Wahlberg as Dignam down to the fact he plays one of those fast talking foul mouthed cops that we've seen in far too many films and HBO series. Perhaps I'm being somewhat harsh to the cast in general and Wahlberg in particular because the dialog in Monahan's screenplay contains far too much swearing . Yeah I know swearing exists in real life but it's almost like it's included in every line just so the audience know that it's a hard hitting adult drama . I think everyone knew that when we saw the name Scorsese in the title . No need to over egg the pudding or include a fist fight every few minutes otherwise someone might think they're watching a Tarintino movie As for the good points ... well if you've liked most of this great auteur's movies then you'll certainly like THE DEPARTED , just not as much as you've liked Scorses's previous output . If you have loved most of Scorsese's films then you'll be slightly disappointed . It's not helped by the fact that this is the first movie directed by Scorsese to pick up the Oscar for best film where as master works like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS didn't
Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical "Jackisms". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.7 out of 10.


                
I know that it is not difficult to say that in every remake's case, but this one really got my hopes high. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case this time. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still great, it just falls below expectation. Yes, Di Caprio is great for the first time (he was good in some movies before, but here he is just superb). Nicholoson - is over the top, being 69 years old he is still much more charismatic and believable than his young rivals. The rest of the cast is just good, no flaws.Whenever they tried to stick to the original - everything worked great. For some unfortunate reason they decided to over-complicate already sophisticated screenplay - and spoiled it. There are some unnecessary characters creating the mess, some FBI storyline in the movie that only God knows what that was intended for. And also the ending - I do not know, ending in the Hong-Kong movie was reasonable and understandable, here it is basically the same - but messy. In the original all of the characters had very clear reasons for everything they did, and they lost it here.My biggest problem with that one is that in the original neither one of the main 2 characters was either complete bastard or saint - and here they actually made it black and white.And no, don't forget about Taxi Driver:) this one is very good (especially if you have not seen the original), but not great.


                
Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a "thriller" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims "harrrrrdest!". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative.


                
Just got back from seeing this in Taiwan (where it opened yesterday, in time for Mid-Autumn festival) Good movie, but decided to re-watch the original (Infernal Affairs) back home... and the original edges over it in terms of emotion, pace and character development.'The departed' is great once it gets going and the premise really starts to kick in,and jack Nicholson is incredible, but I can't help feeling that the director was going for too much humour - from the 9at times0 overly witty dialogue to the closing scene. And some of the set pieces - the elevator scene near the end, for example, are not handled as well as in the original (the audience laughed out loud during the elevator scene, and I'm not sure that was the intended effect).All in all, a good film, but I feel it just misses out on being a great one, especially when compared with its Asian counterpart.


                
If the plot of this film were original, which it isn't I would have given it a 9 out of 10. It was I think well acted, well put together in terms of cinematography, settings and sound. The original Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs) 2002 was I think a better film. It was better acted, more realistic, and less melodramatic. The scenario I found more coherent, less fragmented and with, surprisingly enough less superfluous violence. Also, in the original version two different women are involved and here just one. This change seemed contrived and unlikely. The ending of this film was fixed and not open ended as the original. I guess that is a matter of taste.
First I saw 'The Departed'. It was cool. Then I saw 'Infernal affairs'. It was awesome. Then, after some time, I saw 'The Departed' again. And I realized I've been conned. I wish there was a way to talk about 'The Departed' without constant references to IA, but there isn't. This is not a re-imagining, it is not a remake or a tribute- it's a pure and simple rip-off, most of the time scene by scene, shot by shot. Everything that is good, interesting or storytelling in 'The Departed' originates in IA. All they did was change the setting and the language and dumb down the story here and there with some melodramatic/vulgar effects. Speaking of vulgar; I don't give a s**t about 'ugly words', some of the best movies are full of cursing, and hell, that's how people really talk after all. But... i just couldn't get past of how scenes that are subtle and cool in IA are almost systematically replaced with mindless cursing-orgies here. It's not that they curse it's that they ONLY do that, as if a tirade Wahlberg-style could actually replace acting and real emotions. It seems like throwing in a dick-joke, adding some punches, yelling, being all f**k this and f**k that is what makes true 'realism'. Even in minor scenes; in IA the mob-mole merely has a conversation with the psychologist; here he blows up, yells and runs away. After the cinema scene, when the cop nearly finds out who the mole is in IA you have a tense psychological scene; in The Departed Matt Damon MUST stab somebody, apparently the director doesn't think it's cool enough without that. Or the classic rooftop end scene- in IA the two opponents act calmly, with dignity- here there's cursing and fighting and punching instead of a shared moment of drama. In one word- it's cheap, something you wouldn't expect from Scorsese and this cast.
It's a good remake of a better film to my eyes Scorsese shot the same movies with exact scenes, adding lot of others which don't serve his movies... Infernal affairs from Wai-keung Lau & Alan Mak is better & shorter to me. Lots of scenes and details looks to me really strange, now i've seen the original movie and i just understand that Scorsese just shot a copy, this way, these strange details and strange scenes have a sense to me now... cause they are part of the original and still don't have no sense in Scorsese version. This movie looks good but now i have seen the brilliant original it has no taste anymore http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/


                
The 2006 Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese has brought us some of the greatest films of all time to American Cinema and stands as one of the greatest directors to ever live. With films like "Raging Bull," "Taxi Driver," Goodfellas," and more recently "The Aviator" and "Gangs of New York." Marty now has the best film of 2006 to add to that list of greats with "The Departed." "When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?" This is coldly and meticulously uttered by Boston Mob Boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The significance of the memorable quote tells us that no matter who you are or what you've done; when death is staring you in the face, it takes no prisoners. Costello says this to a group of young impressionable kids and among these impressionable kids is Frank Costello's next and future pawn- the wise, savvy, charismatic, charming, and slick talking Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon, who gives his best acting performance of his career on the heels of another great performance in Robert De Niro's, "The Good Shepherd". From the start we see Colin headed down a path of corruption and deception as he is groomed to become a spy in the Massachusetts State Police for Frank Costello and his Boston mafia. His counterpart, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a cadet who has been kicked out of the academy and the only way he will ever be able to serve the commonwealth is by going undercover and infiltrating Frank Costello's crew for Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen). Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are the only two people that know Billy is a cop. Academy Award nominee, Mark Wahlberg does a great job as the fast talking, always ready for anything, humorous cop that will make you think this is a comedy at certain points in the film instead of a thrilling drama. Dignam can be cold, callous, and most of all, a dirty cop like the rat he hunts for in SIU.As Billy and Colin rise in their respective fields, the tension mounts as suspicion in both the State Police and Costello's crew heats up in search for the rat(s). There are twists and turns in every direction. As they become more and more aware of each others presence the anticipation becomes almost unbearable as both look to find each other and take each other out to protect their own skins.The film brings in plot twist after plot twist and manages to maintain its structure thanks to a perfect script by Academy Award winner, William Monahan. The two opposing figures in the film- Colin and Billy- frantically search and scheme their way to the top all the while sharing a sexual relationship with a psychiatrist, named Madolyn. Both characters fall for her and both unknowingly become twisted in a love triangle that only she knows about, but has no clue how grave her situation is. The motives for each falling in love with the psychiatrist is something to pay close attention to. Look for the reasons Colin wants a girl, and look for the reasons Billy wants a girl. One is putting on an act at all times, and both men struggle to keep their identity in check.Costello puts fear in the heart of both Billy and Colin as he starts to question everyone around him as the heat is turned up on him. Jack Nicholson gives one of his greatest performances of his career, and an Oscar worthy one at that. The psychological fear and mind games that he plays with both Colin and Billy make them fear that their conscience might be getting the best of them. This is something to truly admire and become utterly stunned by as both actors do such a great job of portraying the paranoia. Costello is not your typical gang leader. He is upper class with a little L Street mentality still left in him. He like's to go and listen to the opera. He loves fine wines and lobster dinners (with a side of bloody hand that could make anyone queasy- especially the nervous wreck that is Billy Costigan.). He also doesn't mind indulging in a little annoying fly, that may be crossing his face at the wrong time, or even a little coke to set the mood so that he's comfortably numb. He has his flaws as every man does, but Frank doesn't recognize any weaknesses because he's just so good at making a habit of getting away with murder. The very deep characters surrounding Costello, along with Costello himself, make this a "must see." We watch the drama unfold as the pressure on both Colin and Billy mounts as their guilt of deception and criminal activity makes both men start looking for a safe way out. They realize they both can only take so much and neither sees a way out that doesn't result in death. Colin wants to become a political influence in the community as he goes to law school at nights while Billy just wants his identity back. Neither are able to depart from Costello as he has a strangle hold on their every day lives. This is where we see the characters become three-dimensional and where we start to gravitate towards the characters- good or bad. We see what they are and how far they've fallen. Their weaknesses make them so humane that it's impossible to not feel or root for them.As the body count rises and the pressure is turned up one notch at a time before the final standoff the film becomes mesmerizing. The shocking and surprising ending will leave some pleasantly surprised or some looking for answers and disappointed. For most directors this would be their crowning achievement, but for Martin Scorsese, it just another classic to add the resume.


                
first of all, let me tell you guys "the departed" is a remake of a Hongkong movie "infernal affairs". I know most of the people don't know that, that's why I'm writing this. If you like "the departed", go watch "infernal affairs", then you will see the difference, you will know why "infernal affairs" is so much better in 1. characters 2.consistency in the storytelling 3. logically believable 4. decency(which is the Hollywood movie's weakness) second of all, the story is written by a Hongkong writer, it has Chinese DNA in it, no matter if you believe it or not. It is like Hollywood has Hollywood style and Hongkong movie has its own style too. So when you try to make a remake, rewrite the script, you will lose something essential, especially when you are trying to translate a Chinese spirit into a typical American one, it will be almost impossible. For example, I've seen "infernal affairs" 5 times, I cry every time when I see Queenan get threw out of the building. However, in "the departed", I just can't feel it.third, I didn't know "the departed" get 4 Oscars until the second time I try to see it. I mean, seriously??? Well, I have no idea why. But I do have to admit that Leonard is a little bit handsome in this movie loll. But except for him, the rest of the team just sucks..... Jack Nicholson is a really good actor, but shouldn't be chosen for his role. His character suffers a lot unstable situation when he was young, that's how he get to his place in the organization. But in TD, he is just someone abusing his power whatever it cost. Matt Damon is fine, but he is such a typical cocky American, doesn't have that ability to handle his character. Vera Farmiga's part, I would say, is the only part better than "infernal affairs", however, still can't get rid of the Hollywood stereotype..... what should I say, 6 out of 10 is the maximum I can give.
Several friends and I have been discussing the cheesy ending of this film and it's not just the elevator shoot 'em up. About that silly rat on the balcony railing! Hello?????? Does NO ONE feel that is the most over-the-top moment in a film? Was this in the Hong Kong version everyone's talking about? I can't believe no one close to Martin Scorsese didn't point out to him that terrible visual. Okay! OKAY, we got it, he was a rat! We got it! What, you needed to make us laugh at the end on top of the sloppy ending?? Totally silly, cheesy moment on film. A luxury apartment in a high rise, obviously high up and suddenly there, on the balcony railing, a lone rat balancing precariously on the railing with the capitol dome in the background. The only thing that could have been more ridiculous is if they'd had the rat take a swan dive off the balcony! This movie was so good, so compelling up until the last 4th of the film. Even if it was a remake, considering the director could have remade the film in his own vision, why didn't he improve on that ending? Martin, what happened!!??? Definitely not his best film.
Let me say right off the bat that I liked Scorsese's movie but it lacked something that the original had---"Heart". Infernal Affairs had heart. The movie made you really care about the Moles and the supporting cast. In Scorsese's film, Matt Damon's character is just despicable. In Infernal Affairs the same character is a conflicted man torn between loyalties and gains the audience's sympathy. In the new film you hated Matt Damon and felt nothing about supporting characters. It's really too bad. Scorsese's movie would have been better if the characters gained our sympathy like the original.....that was the purpose of the film. And what's up with Dicaprio banging the same woman as Damon? That's just flat out unrealistic and a stupid and unnecessary sub-plot.


                
The movie in and of itself was good ... until the last 5-10 minutes. It looked like the writers realized the movie was running long and wrapped things up without putting too much energy into how this would look to the viewer. When Will comes out of the elevator with Sullivan and gets shot, they lost me. Where did the other informant come from?? I know he was a buddy of Sullivan but there had been no indication up to that point that he was anything but a third-tier character so why give him such a pivotal task? It didn't make any sense! I would have thought the girlfriend would have been killed (and I'm convinced the baby was Will's) because she knew the secret. By the way, Jack Nicholson looks as creepy in this film as he does in most of his films so the talk about him winning an Oscar is about as well-deserved as Denzel Washington for "Training Day" or Reese Witherspoon for "Walk the Line". All in all, it's a rental.
I must have read a dozen reviews of "The Departed" by professional critics. No one, however, has pointed out the utter meaninglessness of the 20-minute subplot--quickly discarded--involving the selling of mysterious microprocessors to agents of the government of China. It's beyond belief to ask an audience to believe that a local mobster into loan sharking, drug dealing, and the usual local mobster fare would delve into far murkier international intrigue. I guess Scorcese must have had second thoughts, too, since this whole sequence was dropped like a hot potato, not to be mentioned again. Further, and oddly, too, the agents of the Chinese government are seen speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin.Was the subplot a big mistake or was it an expensive tip-of-the-the-cap to the movie's Cantonese origins? In any case, it merely further bloated an already too-long film.


                
I realize that "The Departed" won four Oscars (one for Best Picture and one for Best Director and one for writing). I know that it has a HUGE overall rating on IMDb. I know it's a very popular movie. BUT, the film simply didn't do its homework when it comes to some of the characters. And, because of this, I was not especially impressed by the film. Now before you slam my review with another NOT HELPFUL, hear me out....Had the writers cared about consistency and believability, they would have cared about the only major female character in the film. However, she was a caricature--a lady with zero believability...NONE. While it's true that films often get psychologists, psychiatrists and counselors wrong, this is among the very worst cases. While she's described as a counselor, she prescribes medications (that's illegal by the way--only an MD can do that). And, personal boundaries mean absolutely nothing to her...nothing. Here we have yet another case where a supposed professional begins sleeping with one of her patients--and one of the most screwed up ones at that! There is no reason to believe this relationship--there is no chemistry and he clearly is a mess...so she sleeps with him!! Why can't a film show a mental health worker who isn't crazy? Does some Tom Cruise write all the roles for psychotherapists in movies?! How can anyone believe her character in any way?! How does this bad writing get rewarded with all these Oscars? To me, an Oscar implies perfection...or at least near perfection...and this is not it.By the way, since I am on a tirade, I am also irritated that the main baddie is called 'Frank Costello' (Jack Nicholson). Why pick this name since the real life Costello was a HUGE figure in the underworld and bore little semblance to the guy in the film (who is more like Whitey Bulger, by the way)? What not give him some totally fictional name? Why, if he's so much like Bulger, does his fate have nothing to do with Bulger's? I don't get it.Now I am NOT saying it's a terrible film or I hate it. It's just flawed. So, despite Leonardo DiCaprio's wonderful performance and a taut script, it is a film that didn't really seem good enough to have received all these accolades.
I was a skeptic. I saw Infernal Affairs for the first time a few months ago and thought it was an excellent movie. One of the best Asian flicks i've seen (and i've seen a lot of them). I thought "great....another American remake". There was a small glimmer of hope. It's Scorsese after all. I waited....great rotten tomatoes rating. Great IMDb rating. Was this the comeback of American cinema? I was excited. It was what a wanted. A great story, great actors (well...more on that later), and a great great director who understood the genre.Well...apparently, my guess is everyone that raved about this movie hasn't seen Infernal Affairs. This film, in no way, lives up to the original. I think, if you haven't seen the original, you would probably think this is the greatest film ever. The story is that clever, and Scorsese is that good. Unfortunately, it ALMOST all ways (not all...almost all) the Chinese movie betters this one.You would have thought Scorsese learned after Gangs of New York that Leo does not make a good tough guy. Guess not. I hope Leo plays to his strengths and take roles more similar to Catch Me if You Can or the Aviator.Martin Sheen's character is no where near as prominent as the Chinese flick. and in the end, as great as Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio are, they do not have the "coolness" factor that Andy Lau and Tony Leung brought.There were some correction of plot holes that were re-written to make more sense, but in general the plot changes were no good. Some scenes were done different to the original, but some scenes were done shot by shot. Unfortunately, even these copies scenes didn't deliver as powerfully as Infernal Affairs.Infernal Affairs had such a great "coolness" factor to it. And the chase/action scenes were executed in a way that built up WAY more suspense than The Departed.All that said, still a decent movie. But seriously.....if you've seen Infernal Affairs, don't expect this to live up to the hype it's been getting. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs, I'll leave you with two options.1) You are OK with watching non-Hollywood films and don't mind reading subtitles. By all means grab the Infernal Affairs DVD and watch this!2) You hate reading subtitles and dislike non-Hollywood films. Watch The Departed and enjoy it. It is good.....but i fear only because the original story was good.


                
Leo swore on his mothers grave that he wasn't a "fawking cawp" but he was lying because he was a cawp. Very sad!
In Martin Scorcese's "The Departed," Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling "moles" working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law. Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a "rat" planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations. The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick "Infernal Affairs," finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence. In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director. Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, "The Departed" falls short of the "Goodfellas" glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom.On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion. In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles. Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don't mind watching it yet another time. The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion. There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side. One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film's success.Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in "The Departed" - a kind of unity and focus that turned "Goodfellas" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre. The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art. The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in "The Verdict"). The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against "Goodfellas." Moreover, even the violence in "The Departed" is handled much less effectively than it was in "Goodfellas." In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in "The Departed," the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film.Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to "Goodfellas," a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of film-making. It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product. A good film but not a great one.


                
Two newly-graduated police officers Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are hired by the Massachusetts State Police, one to simultaneously infiltrate the Irish mafia lead by the colourful Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and one to investigate leaks within the bureau. Their respective tasks parallel each other at all times, but they never meet. Cue intrigue en masse, coated with tense cat-and-mouse games and green-and-white Irish culture in Boston, making The DepAHted something of a Goodfellas lite.This is, essentially, all that is achieves. For a 'Best Picture' nominee, The Departed lacks heart and makes up for it by trafficking in violence, suspense and swearing. The aforementioned naturally gets it a long way with most people, and indeed even with me, but since Martin Scorsese is incapable of making a film shorter than two and a half hours, the substance stretches thin. I'm no math whiz but things simply do not add up to a complete film. Much like in Goodfellas, The Aviator and Gangs of New York, Scorsese gets so taken with the setting and atmosphere that he positively dawdles on scenes and the majority of these serve no other function in the story than to get us a feel for the way--and the venality--with which things are run.The acting, by contrast, is actually good. Jack Nicholson may simply be rehashing his psycho-Jack routine but it works as well as ever and he chews scenery whenever he is on screen. Leonardo Dicaprio inhabits something of a lead role in the film, but his acting regimen consists of shouting as loudly as he can. Billy Costigan is a difficult character to capture the nature of, for he is both contradictory and confused, jockeyed between the Irish mafia and his allegiance to the police department. Matt Damon's slick character Colin Sullivan is a joy to watch as he "rises faster than a twelve year old's dick" in his career, but much credit is also due to Mark Walhberg's streetsmart Dignam who is given some excellent and brilliantly funny dialogue in the script, such as the latter observation about Sullivan. The only problem is that he is at the mercy of a grossly underwritten character.The big problem that The Departed has is that its story rotates around genuinely unlikeable anti-heroes. I'm not even sure if they'd qualify as heroes, for these are characters with good qualities that are so distant that you need binoculars. It is difficult to slot them in protagonist/antagonist positions because while Sullivan is corrupt and selfish, he is funny, charming and we follow him from childhood. Costigan, by contrast, lacks all the enjoyable theatricality of his polar character and comes across as whiny, moody and desperate in his actions but certainly he is morally right in the film, and quite firmly on the side of good in spite being taken under the wings of Nicholson the mob boss himself.Without likable characters a wide array of problems follow, but the direction, pace and action of the film cleverly mask most of these. Who cares that all women are hookers (often literally)? Who cares that these is product placement by the bucketload? And who cares that the ending is one huge mess? The fact is that Martin Scorsese knows how to craft a compelling film, and much of this expertise has translated into an enjoyable crime cop drama with Boston accents and slang that snap and crackle like kindling in a fireplace. Ultimately, the actors sing tunes we have all heard before and the story may be intricately-sketched but we have been down this road before, so this is nothing revolutionary. And where, pray tell, is the tracking shot?!7- out of 10


                
This was a very good film and I would recommend it overall. Riveting and interesting up until the last several minutes. But the ending was 'cheap' and did not capitalize on the story and the character build-up.(SPOILER!!!!!) So much more could have been done after Damon and Di Caprio knew about each other - but the writing tanked at that point.Overall, very good direction. Fantastic performances from Nicholson, Damon, Di Caprio, etc. But a very flat ending that was done, seemingly, for shock value and nothing more. A disappointment.For those with a dark sense of humor (like mine) it was very funny - and Nicholson was in his element.I expect some nominations out of this, some of which would not be warranted (picture, screenplay, possibly even direction). But again, the main players were great in their roles - primarily Damon, Di Caprio, and Nicholson.
I went into this with very high expectations. #50 on the IMDb top 250, 92% fresh on rottentomatoes. I was disappointed, but I set myself up for it.It's a good movie, but after seeing this I'm starting to believe that a lot of the '10s' from IDMb voters, did in fact, come from those that hadn't seen Infernal Affairs. I'm not going to come out and say Infernal Affairs is a better movie. When you add up all the elements of both films, The Departed is the superior piece of film-making. What disappointed me though, was that Scorcese really didn't take it to the dizzying heights I would've expected after such a positive reaction from almost everyone that had seen it.Probably every aspect is improved upon in terms of the production process, with the exception of editing. I thought some of the earlier scenes about their childhoods were unnecessary and failed to add anything really substantial to the structure of the original... and that's perhaps my complaint for the whole movie. By the end I felt like I'd just watched Infernal Affairs all over again. What was good, didn't really change. What was bad was changed, but not in such a way that it made any dramatic impact.The romance subplot for instance, was equally as dull as it had been in the original. There wasn't much chemistry between the psychiatrist and the two leads.. it was done well enough to make a point about the two of them, but not well enough to really move me.The acting was fine, believable, occasionally there'd be something that'd make me draw breath from Jack Nicholas and Leonardo DiCaprio. But most of the time, nothing more.I guess what I'm trying to say is this: had I never seen Infernal Affairs, The Departed would have been nothing short of spectacular. But I had. And what I got was a very competent remake from the master that didn't take the story or characters to any dramatic new depths. What ultimately kept my attention wasn't anything different that Scorcese did, but the same, tense game of cat and mouse that was lifted straight of the original.Honestly I wanted to sing this movie praises, but all I can really do is clap and say: 'well done'.


                
It was great acting by everyone involved until the ending. The ending was too incoherent and left too many unanswered questions for my tastes. I felt let down after expecting so much. My biggest problem was why Billy, knowing he has only one person left on the PD who knows what he's doing and also knowing he can't trust anyone else because of the mole, doesn't find Wahlberg before turning himself in. What did the girl getting pregnant have to do with anything? Why wasn't Damon more upset knowing that the girl heard the CD? What about the letter? Did she give it to Wahlberg? Every other person in the movie was a mole in either the PD or the mob including the mob boss. And when Billy mentions to Damon that the only other person he's talked to has been a police psych and Damon got a strange look on his face I thought that was going to lead to some discovery. Nothing. Too many threads that went nowhere. Good grief. Just try to sort out the cell phones. The more I think about it the less I like it.
