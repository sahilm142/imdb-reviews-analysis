 Mad Max is back

 Insanely cool visuals, but nothing more, just madly overrated.

 Hell on Earth

 mindless violence with harsh, survivalist set design

 What is Mad Max doing in this movie?

 Visually stunning, no story though

 without story or characterisation equals no involvement

 Not as good as expected

 Over the top insanity, mayhem, and violence... and that's just OK

 Stunning visually but lacks story.

 Good not great.

 Get ready for a massive car chase

 Not much madness

 Looks different but isn't

 Mad Max Fury Road Review

 Mad Max Fury Road Warrior

 Great Action! Characters Lacking

 Again IMDb.?... Again?

 Action, action, action

 Visual over-sophistication, waste of good actors

 Isn't It Suppose To Be All About Mad Max?

 Decent

 Amazing battle scenes, boring and hard to understand plot.

 more of a run and gun than a storyline film.

 A pleasant surprise.
