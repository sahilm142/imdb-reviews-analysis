 Third part of Indiana Jones series with agreeable and sympathetic interpretation by Sean Connery

 the best Indiana Jones movie ever?

 Great Entertainment

 Vastly Entertaining Way to End the Trilogy

 Classic....Classic

 Sharing your adventures is an interesting experience...

 Definitely the best one in the series

 The best of the lot

 Grand adventure. Dynamic leads. Fun and suspense. Hot hot hot film!

 As great as Raiders

 superb third Jones film redeems the series

 A Litte Loud, But It's Fun Like The Other Two

 All in all a good outing for Indiana and his dad

 A great second fiddle

 A film that is adventurous, but also funny

 What is there not to say about Indian Jones

 Repetition Helps, but It's Not the Key.

 The series take a different path which still works thanks to the cast mostly

 True Escapism

 A Must See! Uncomparable Adventure!

 The best Indy of them all

 Real adventure!

 The best Indiana Jones (For me at least)

 Good, but not as good...
