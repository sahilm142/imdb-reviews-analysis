 Great!

 Has some pacing issues, but the parts where stuff actually happens makes up for it

 Had potential, but highly disappointing in the end.

 I wish I'd forget it so I could watch it again.

 I get the Game of Thrones/Skyrim vibes off this!

 I would have given it 10 but...

 to be continued!

 first anime i've watched and it's one of my favorite shows

 Good enough

 Perfect anime for a binge watch

 Great

 Has problems but really good

 It's good, but its not worth the hype

 must see

 Friendly Review of Attack On Titan

 Flawed? Yes. Fun? Definitely.
