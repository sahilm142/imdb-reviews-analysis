 Dog of a film

 Brutal, unpleasant, and anyway, what's GOOD about it?

 Awful, Just Awful

 Awful movie!

 Abominably Bad

 Why?

 Inarritu Should have never left the radio

 wake me when it starts...

 Worst Movie in a LONG Time

 Dog owners should steer clear

 thoroughly depressing. avoid this esp if you like dogs.

 Love It Only If You Are A Dog

 Cruelty to animals for your entertainment

 If you liked Babel & Crash then you will love Amores Perros!
