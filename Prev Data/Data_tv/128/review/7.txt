I remember watching the first couple of seasons, and the French chefs' especial episodes, and being amazed by each story and the food that was created because of that stories, being the food the center piece of the whole show. The attention to details was outstanding. It was an A+ show. This last few seasons have turned into something else, a different kind of dish, maybe a little less about the food and about something else, even politics. I miss the way the "old show" felt more tightly focused, more surprising. I think it worked so much better and was far more exquisite. It used to feel especial, a rare treat. But if I have to grade it now, it would barely be a B-.


                
Season 1-4 plus the French episodes are amazing and truly inspirational! One of the best things Netflix have put out.I understand there's only a handful of extraordinary chefs, but there's gotta be some more interesting chefs than those they've included in the last two seasons. At least put more focus on the food rather than dragging it out. I used to turn on chefs table to be inspired, now I turn it on for sleep aid.


                
Amazing Chefs! All episodes have amazing chefs with outstanding talent. The slow pace of the show is sometimes good, because you really get to know the "food artists" and their background. It is special and one of a kind. But is just over dramatic. After Some episodes it gets really annoying! Although the cooks are absolutely fantastic in what they do, it feels like an over dramatic ego show. the cinematography is good, the chefs are amazing, really good food! But over dramatic to a point it is annoying. It is like : my tears are running down my face when I chop up the lamb. And when I crush that oyster, my whole life flashes before my eyes. Like...please shut up and do ur thanggg! It is all so poetic and over acted. But still a 7. Because it is something fresh and new; and with heart.
