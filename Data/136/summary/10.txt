 The Best Film based on one of Shakespeare Best Works. This Masterpiece is recommended for anyone that loves movies . Truly one of the Greatest Films of all time!

 The Greatest Shakespeare Film

 RAN - A Classic Of Its Time And For All Time

 My third favorite Kurosawa film- deliberately paced (not painfully so), heavy on tragedy, and glorious in overall artistry

 Jester and Warlord

 Greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic

 Sometimes, given sufficient objectives, even the people who are closer to you than anyone else can turn against you.

 Single. Greatest. Shakespeare. Adaptation. Ever.

 Awe Inspiring

 King Lear adaptation..and Great!:)

 The most provocative ending.

 Kurosawa paints a colourful oil on canvas

 Quite simply one of the finest films ever made

 Truly Epic Movie

 The Greatest Shakespearian Adaptation of All Time, and the Crown Jewel of Akira Kurosawa's Career

 Kurosawa's Final Masterpiece Is A Godsend

 A Masterwork By A Master Artist

 Shakespeare in Japan

 Kurosawa's Last Masterpiece

 One of cinema's great masterpieces

 The last movie in samurai genre of Akira Kurosawa turns into the best picture of all-time
