 The writing has just gotten terrible

 Season 8 is Shameful

 A series that will make you suffer

 What?

 Yet another preachy show.

 Shameless Season 2 Episode 1

 Tries too hard and fails

 Vulgar glorification & reinforcement for today's misled youth.

 Watch the British (original) version

 Suicide by stupidity.

 Wastes its potential - this show could be much better then it is

 Showtime ruins Shameless

 Barely above average
