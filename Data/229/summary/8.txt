 Riveting in terms of suspense<U+0085>

 The Devils

 Timeless Classic

 Good movie

 Once in a Lifetime

 A chilling thriller

 "Don't you believe in Hell?"

 Classic suspense film from Clouzot "the French Hitchcock"

 Lots to offer for suspense buffs

 Dated but still a commendable classic psychological mystery.

 Diabolical French plumbing is the main focus . . .

 Not as good as I remembered it!

 "My only regret is that he'll never know that I killed him."

 "Les diaboliques" or "the evil"

 The Wife, the Mistress, and the Devil

 Unpredictable...

 Amazing!

 Classic of Horror and French Cinema

 Classic Clouzot suspense!

 The Shoes

 Diabolically suspenseful

 The Corpse Vanishes!

 I may be reactionary, but this is absolutely astounding - the legal wife consoling the mistress! No, no, and no!

 A Child Can Figure It Out

 An exemplary classic of French suspense cinema
