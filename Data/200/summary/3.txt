 Paganini he is not

 Over rated

 A little too black and white and red all over

 So Sorry, But . . .

 A TV Movie with a splash of Colour

 12 years of yawn!

 Very slow, never drawn into the characters personalities and the story didn't tie together

 A Masterpiece of Human Horror Tragically Edited as a Horror Flick

 Is it possible to leave cold showing how they enslave someone?

 Ejiofor Saves A Pointless Stinkfest.

 Sadly fooled by the media hype

 What did I just watch?

 poor performance and lack of originality

 12 Years a slave, typical inaccurate stereotype of southern cruelty of slaves

 An unforgivably wasted opportunity to tell a remarkable story

 2 hours and 14 minutes almost asleep

 Unspeakable Abuse.

 Violence without insight

 um, no

 Such A Story Of Substance, But Not In This Movie.

 A powerful story, a bad movie.

 12 Yrs Of Disappointment

 Insert Emotions Here.
