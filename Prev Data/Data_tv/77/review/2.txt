I'd heard a lot of good things about this cartoon, so I decided to give it a chance.The pilot episode made no sense whatsoever and the characters were daft and annoying. Okay, so it's "anime", let's continue...After a further 3 episodes - a total of approximately 96 minutes, the average running time of a film - the plot was still pretty much going nowhere, the characters were still daft and annoying and my patience was definitely wearing thin.I gave it the 5th episode just because someone had told me that the programme was so "intelligent", but I guess that meant that schoolgirls weren't constantly showing their underwear and giant robots weren't duking it out in space! All the characters did in the 5th episode was read a few e-mails. The logline on IMDb talks about some students travelling through time to fight a dastardly corporation, but nobody fought, time-travelled and the "evil conglomerate" was more like a paranoid conspiracy theory.Hey, maybe if I'd have sat through the remaining 20 episodes the programme could have justified its enormous 8.5 average rating... but I highly doubt it. Anime fans are ridiculously bias and anyone considering watching this should take note of that, when seeing the high metascore.My advice: avoid it.
