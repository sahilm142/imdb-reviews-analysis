 You Have To Be Kidding

 More 300 and Less Rome.

 From epic to melodrama

 Top choice for adolescent males

 Nothing Special

 Vulgair: Blood & Boobs

 Over-hyped

 Started good, but ended in slapstick

 Me smash ...

 *SIGH* Booooooooriiiiiiiiing...

 from worse to worst

 Sorry I even watched this

 wooden acting, implausible plots, no history

 Intolerable. Praise this show has received is shocking.

 Amazing how long a show can live on nudity alone.

 Supera Gladiador, 300 y Troya
