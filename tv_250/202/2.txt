I wish people would take out of consideration the fact that this involves Bruce Campbell & Sam Raimi, and judge it by content. If you look at this sans-nostalgia, it's purely stupid. The jokes are the witless hardy-har kind (unimportant spoiler: Ash idiotically walks through shards of shattered bulbs he just smashed, wincing in pain...really?) I get that it's trying to maintain it's cheesiness, but even campy stuff needs to be original (possessed lamps and mounted heads in Evil Dead 2 got it right). I love the Evil Dead movies, even the new one. So, I'm not judging this as an outsider or as someone who hates reboots. I'm the ideal audience, and they still got it wrong with me. Oh, also, the gore looks terribly CGI. I remember the creator of the 2013 Evil Dead talking about preserving the tangibility of the original movies by using props and blood buckets over CGI in his own. I wish they'd done that here, too, because it really is important to the essence of Evil Dead.
