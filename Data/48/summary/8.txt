 A Throwback To The Epics Of The '60s

 Impressive epic movie with strong casting , rousing sets , and overwhelming combats

 Great Special Effects, OK Movie.

 An excellent, albeit historically inaccurate, film.

 Thank you Ridley Scott.

 One of the best

 Amazing and a bit disappointing.

 A great epic...

 Solidly executed with a good story and the mark of a classic action film.

 Timeless Modern Classic

 Great Russell Crowe vehicle

 The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor.
