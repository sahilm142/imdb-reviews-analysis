 YEP! I AM THE ONE GUY WHO DIDN'T LIKE FARGO!

 Another overrated Coen brothers film

 This Movie Was Terrible

 The cold north holds grim boredom.

 What's so funny?

 well thats that

 This movie was too violent to be anything you could call comedy

 Missing important pieces

 No, no and no

 Not Bad, But...

 average story with exaggerated accents

 Have I been watching the same movie???

 Why?
