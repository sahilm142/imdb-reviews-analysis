 The Mighty Warriors Who Became the Seven National Heroes of a Small Town

 Good movie, mixes comedy with drama, but I fail to see why so many consider it great.

 A Classic, Just Not Perfect

 Engaging

 Golden sequence...

 Self-Sacrificing Samurai

 You owe Seven Samurai a debt of gratitude

 an emblem of unity that shines unflinchingly..

 Beyond the cine-history...

 Long & Boring Good movie

 Seven Samurai

 Among the best foreign films

 A good movie that is reminiscent of a silent movie

 Just watch the first 5mins

 The sacred right to defend

 Best film of all time or best film of it's time.

 First-rate, but a bit too long

 A strong, expertly-made, and influential movie

 as samurai-esque as it gets

 Was it really three and a half hours?

 An Essential Piece of Japanese Film

 Samurai behaving badly

 Arguably the most influential action film of all time !!!

 Deserves this rank in top 250...!

 A Classic for an Eternity
