 I really enjoyed this film!

 Routine work from Mr. Miyazaki

 Enjoyable but Unimaginative

 Great provided you are not a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan or watch the film with one!

 Whimiscal wizardry and war drama

 Amazing!

 Enjoyable movie for adults.

 Fire, Magic and a boy's heart

 glorious visuals

 I haven't seen too many of Miyazaki's movies (besides Spirited Away and Totoro), but this sure beats any Disney productions.

 Striking

 Miyazaki delivers again

 Howl if you like Howl's Moving Castle!! WOOOOO!!!

 Beautiful

 A visually spectacular movie.

 Beautiful and funny

 Bizarre and wonderful

 A touching love story

 Breathtaking like every Miyazaki film-but storyline a bit too much the same

 "Look at that. They call this a castle?"

 Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli fail to live up to their otherwise well deserved reputation.

 Sophie, are we a family?

 Once again there is still room for meaning in the world of charming, animated fantasy.

 Regular viewers won't care that film students and professional critics think it not as good as Miyazaki's earlier work

 Wonderful movie, entertained completely
