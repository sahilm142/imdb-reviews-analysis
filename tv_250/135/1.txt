needs to rethink the choices of stick with material that somebody else wrote . This is not entertaining at all. After watching this I felt like Ace Ventura after he found out Einhorn was a man. Had to vomit, burn the clothes I was wearing, try to plunger the show out of my head, and just sat in the shower trying to wash this show away. So bad. So awful. Doesn't even deserve 1 star.please


                
It was an hour long commercial for beats, how this got sold as a documentary is beyond me. It's an hour long circlejerk of some pretty heavy names that talks down competition and pats eachothers back while not really saying anything worthwhile.
