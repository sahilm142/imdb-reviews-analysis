 A magic show.

 very very well done

 For the Matrix generation grown into their mid-30s

 Watch it if you want your brain to work continuously.

 If you liked Dexter, you'll like Mr. Robot

 This show has taken over my heart!

 Brilliant!

 After Two Seasons....

 Promising start, but with concerns

 One obvious twist in season one. But after that, almost perfect television.

 First time that I'm not sure where a show is going
