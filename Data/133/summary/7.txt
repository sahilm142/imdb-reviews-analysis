 Music Did Not Match Content

 To zither or not to zither, that is the question...

 cinematic art work

 All sizzle, flimsy plot

 Typical Welles classic

 A Movie That "thinks in terms of human beings"

 Enthralling mystery thriller classic with striking photography and characters - but that music score is seriously SO out of place!

 Trust Or Mistrust.

 A Great Film-Noir.

 A Great movie of 1949

 Technically spiffy, not film noir

 Beautifully Photographed and Directed; Artistic, Seminal and Overrated

 A good film - Not a classic.

 Classic Film Noir

 Overrated. Orson Welles steals the lead.

 I liked very much the book but I think the film doesn't honor it

 A rather simple mystery tale

 I give it a 7

 Actress "Valli" - Film's Only Major Disappointment

 Didn't live up to expectations

 Interesting film noir

 Classic Noir With A Post War Feel

 Slightly overrated, but that is not to say it wasn't a good movie.

 Who is the third man?

 A Fine Film with Three Immensely Irritating Things
