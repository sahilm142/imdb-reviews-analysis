This is virtually the definitive teen coming-of-age drama story filled with fondness for the 60s - (with a ripper soundtrack); and setting a major film trend in the late 80s/early 90s. It's poignant and melancholic with some comic asides - but definitely NOT the great fun comic story that most professional film critics ranked it as.***Spoiler warning***IMHO, the best comedy scene is the one where Chris and Gordie find the gun ("don't worry, it's not loaded...")! The story Gordie tells is also funny, but the characters are very self-conscious about it, due to the fact that they're snickering all the way through it, which means it's not really funny for the audience.But one of the best proofs this is not a comedy is the climactic line "We decided that an anonymous phone call would be sufficient" - which I rank as one of the most anti-climactic lines in the history of cinema! After going through all the hassle and drama of the whole movie in order to become famous and get away from their drab lives. And after defeating the bullies and seeing the body, they just chuck it in at the end. If this was a comedy, the characters would have tried to become rich and famous (even though they probably would have failed.)By the way, in answer to one of the questions posed in the movie, Goofy is a dog. In fact, as an interesting bit of trivia, he was originally going to be called Dippy Dawg.Still this is a very good dramatic storyline about young teenagers going on an adventure and discovering things about life and themselves (even if that is an old plot line cliché). And I highly recommend viewers to check the the Mad magazine spoof version of this movie; it's a dead-set spot-on parody.
Spoilers herein.The first duty of a filmmaker is to worry about how to transport the viewer into the special world they have in mind. The hard way to do this is by devising a very strong narrative. Expert filmmakers then worry about the identity of the camera.The simple way to do it is to just evoke a feeling, the bane of countless genre films. But sometimes you can strike gold by making `personal' films. Here is about the only one I can recall that works. It's very risky.This is a highly abstract film. Essentially nothing happens. The four characters exist without much visual reference to the rest of the world: some punks drift in and out, a junkyard worker, few others. Four characters, boys who are young enough to behave exactly as stereotypes and not have the audience revolt. The stereotypes go through just what one would expect, but that doesn't matter because that's not where the value is: it is all in the very fresh here and now and the dialog that creates the ephemeral moment.
Lots and lots of great one-liners. That's the magic of this project.Reiner knows this, or perhaps King. (I haven't read the story.) That's the point of the story within the story. The story has no real story to it, only a mood. If this were real boys it would be a diarrhea joke, but vomit is good enough. Reiner follows the hard rule that the story within the story has to be abstracted from the movie the same distance that the movie is from real life.Check out the berry connection.The comment from the listening boys is an inside joke: `but what happens to Lardass?' That story is the same type as this one. It is all about situation, not movement. All about not growing up, not about growing up. All about the moments, not the consequences of those moments: the junk man will call their Dads. The thugs will threaten violence. None of the boys will keep the secret of the body. Since we are relieved of the consequences, of the very notion of dynamic narrative, we can steep in an artificial zen of remembered childhood. It works.The only blot is Richard Dreyfuss whose job it is to frame this and provide the bridge to `reality.' What's needed is a writer's stance, someone who lives in the frame, not the framed. Instead, Dreyfuss places himself in the world of the kids. But his posturing, all his mechanical acting just dumps the stereotypes of the kids on his shoulders and on him it is not charming. The right stance would be that of Michael Douglas at the end of `Wonder Years.'
I remembered watching this 20 some-odd years ago and what I remembered were three things:1.) I liked it 2.) The crossing the train tracks scene 3.) The leeches sceneI watched it again just yesterday and I can completely see my childhood fascination with this movie. But before I mention why I liked it I first have to ask... what is with Stephen King and children?Carrie, The Shining, Cujo, Firestarter, Cat's Eye, Children of the Corn, It, Stand by Me, et al. OK, granted, Stand by Me is nothing like the others, but it stars kids nonetheless. Stand by Me was a good ol' fashioned drama and I can see why I liked it and still like it. I got to see four foul-mouth pals take an adventure that I only dreamed of taking when I was that age. To have the freedom to just roam the woods with three of my best friends on a mission; that's little boy heaven. These four youth all had their problems but they were a band of brothers together. They laughed, cried, fought, played, roughhoused and everything else together; exactly what all regular boys do. There were no heroics, no real highs and no real lows just life. For all of the adults who forgot what it was like as a kid, Stand by Me is the reminder.


                
It was 1987 when I first went to see this flick and in fact wondered why I saw it THREE times? Later it occurred to me this was a coming of age film and anyone from 18-80 who is a man, probably has some unconscious baggage about such hard, yet unforgettable experiences.I recently got a 50 inch plasma so thought, why not get some of the films I recall as classic.I very much enjoyed River Phoenix as a kid, who was 16, but in the film looked not a day over 14.The sad and prophetic part, is where River walks away and vanishes down the road forever.Isn't this what time does for us? Just as we realize we have had an experience, its over and gone, who knows where.


                
*minor spoilers*
It's strange that the best Stephen King films are derived from his non-horror works. For example, "The Shawshank Redemption" has no supernatural elements whatsoever, yet it is almost universally regarded as the best of an otherwise unremarkable group. It's hard to believe that such a fine film originated from a writer whose works spawned such disreputable films such as the lame "Children of the Corn" and the infamous "Maximum Overdrive," which got bad reviews, but it wasn't completely terrible. Director Rob Reiner's acclaimed coming-of-age tale, "Stand by Me," belongs on the admittedly short list of successful King adaptions. Inspired by his novella, "The Body," it demonstrates the bestselling author's skill at creating well-drawn characters, further brought to life by a talented cast and production crew.One might make the mistake of thinking that "Stand by Me" is some ordinary teen melodrama, but the film is more than the sum of its genre conventions. Reiner balances drama, humor, and suspense with ease, never losing us with abrupt shifts in tones. No matter what the scene entails, it never seems forced or jarring. They are all elements in the human drama. There's a masterful setpiece of suspense involving a train, which grabs hold of the viewer and makes one wonder how the characters will escape this particular predicament. Not long after, there's a story-within-a-story, told as a campfire tale about the disgusting outcome of a pie-eating contest. I admit it's pretty gross, but it's something one would expect young boys to discuss with their peers. The ending is another good suspense scene, refreshing in its refusal to wuss out, as similar films are wont to do.The young cast pulls it off with aplomb. In their hands, each character is a fully-rounded human being, not a group of stereotypes. The standout is River Phoenix; even when he was so young, he demonstrated an astounding range, exceeding most performers twice his age. It is a great loss to the acting profession that he has since lost his life to drug abuse. Wil Wheaton has earned a degree of infamy for his portrayal of Wesley Crusher in "Star Trek: The Next Generation," but in this movie he proves that he can act. Corey Feldman faced the challenge of portraying a mentally unbalanced kid, certainly not an easy thing for a child actor to do, but he makes the character completely credible. Jerry O'Connell's character is a bit annoying, but at least he makes him a believable human being. Kiefer Sutherland is burdened with the most thankless role in the film, as a gang leader, but his acting skills temper the shallowness of his character, whose screen time is thankfully limited."Stand by Me" is not a "plot movie," but a character study. It deals with how different personalities interact and conflict, hopefully coming to a better understanding of the fact. This is true even under the most ideal circumstances, but in a life-altering situation, bonds and alliances are seriously put to the test. In this case, the main characters embark on a journey to find a dead body, but given the outcome of the story, I doubt that they would have done so had they known what was going to happen. In the end, they are wiser, but not nearly as happy.*** (out of ****)Released by Columbia Pictures
There's a certain irony that one of the most mature films to come from the pen of Stephen King is the one based on a group of kids in the 1950s. Yet this is far from a children's film, instead it's a thoroughly dark coming-of-age drama that explores what it means to be growing up in a realistically downbeat world, as childhood innocence is abandoned in favour of harsh adult reality.It's also a cracking "gang of kids" drama, stylistically similar to the likes of THE GOONIES and THE MONSTER SQUAD and even sharing some of the same cast members, albeit with a much more realistic theme. The film is set in 1950s Maine on a hot summer day, where a gang of lads decide to track down the body of a boy hit by a train in return for a reward.In reality it's an excuse for lots of adventures with trains, leeches, and junkyard owners, as well as a nasty antagonist played with gleeful relish by Kiefer Sutherland. There's plenty of crudity here alongside that infamous gross-out pie eating contest, but it's surprisingly mature too with deep characters and genuine performances. River Phoenix is the one who really shines (RIP), but Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell really nail it too. Perhaps the wraparound scenes with Richard Dreyfuss are a little too sentimental, but it's not enough to detract from STAND BY ME being a minor classic of the decade. Great soundtrack too.


                
I only realized it was based on a novel written by Stephen King with the credits roll. No wonder the script is brilliant! the story goes like this, 4 teenage boys go on a walking trip to see a dead body of another teenage boy who have been missing for days. On their way you start knowing about each of them and their backgrounds. The movie was produced in 1986 and is told as a flash back from the main character's memories of 1960's.I must admit the directing was spot on! it kept me interested the whole time, I didn't want to pause the movie for a minute. I think because the movie is set mostly outdoors, the lighting was really good, even scenes set indoors had the same quality of lighting.Again the script was beautiful, you can relate to each and every word these 4 teenage boys talk about. It draws you back to the times where the biggest questions we faced were about Micky Mouse and Goofy. Another thumps up to the 4 kids, I didn't feel for a second they were acting a role, they were incredibly professional. My favorite character was Teddy Duchamp by Corey Feldman, he was the little crazy teenage boy. There were few scenes when you could tell they are trying hard to show a certain emotion like crying, but it works.Oh, almost forgot, soundtracks were fabulous! I loved them all, but here to share my two favorites. Lollipop by The Chordettes (it might be a little cheesy, but its lovely)also the main soundtrack of the movie Stand By Me by Ben E.King (its very touching)The few things that I didn't like about the movie, was it felt a little bit teenagy, like teenagers would like it more, however I absolutely loved the movie, it kept me interested, it made feel nostalgic and I simply enjoyed it. I would defiantly say its worth watching (and worth being on the top250 list) and would see it again and again, no doubt. its-lalas-land.blogspot.com
There's a point in Rob Reiner's pleasing 1985 film Stand by Me in which the primary characters themselves, in the form of four young boys of around about double figures in age, identify the trip they're all going on as anything but "just a load of fun" or an excuse to "have fun" or that they 'ought' to be having fun. Where the allure of doing something a little rebellious and sneaking off with three friends for a few days so as to visit a yet undiscovered crime scene sounded like a great time prior to taking off, it is only half way through the journeying that the real world out and away from your home does not necessarily adhere to your initial vision. In a certain sense, we feel the same way about the film: an unobtrusive and light hearted comedy about a bunch of boys breaking all the rules and having fun in the process on the surface but something much more beneath that. There is nothing funny about what the four primary child characters go through in Stand by Me, nothing funny about the realities they face nor what it is they both experience and learn as a result of what they do. Like the boys at the soul of the film itself going through what they're going through, the audience themselves are invited to take a step back and really mediate on what it is we truly think about what's transpiring before our eyes.The story of the four boys is narrated to us by a certain Gordie Lachance, the later incarnation of whom is portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss in the then present day 1980s with Wil Wheaton playing the younger version from some thirty years previously. His friends, with whom he lives in a close knit Oregon community in the latter stages of the 1950s, are Chris Chambers (Phoenix); Teddy Duchamp (Feldman) and Vern Tessio (O'Connell), together forming a quartet of really well rounded, engaging characters whom end up in a flurry of situations both before and during the venturing out to a rural zone on the outskirts of town that it has been heard harbours the dead body of another young boy. LaChance sits idly in his vehicle to the side of a country road in the immediate opening, sighing with a tone of regret at a newspaper story detailing the death of someone. A group of kids cycle past him, they garner his attention and ours in that the following track-in on LaChance results in a flashing back to his own childhood which, like the physical manifestation of the boys whom just went by, has indeed passed him by.The set up sees a somewhat bubbled existence within the Oregon town of Castle Rock established to be life's norm. The kids spend most of their spare time in a secluded tree house away from everybody else laughing and joking at each other's expense in-between humbling information usually linked to troubles at home provided by the narrator on each of the other three involved. The sense of the community being closely knitted feels prominent, a scene showing one of the boys in Chris receiving a harmless enough lift from a truck driver to meet up with one of the other boys establishing a worry-free sense of togetherness in this small, enclosed world of your bog-standard adolescent living through crude humour; practical jokes; the coming to terms with home truths which itself comes with an odd sense of alienation from one's parents as well as the threats posed from local bullies.The few or so days they spend out of this enclosed circle of a functioning world that is their home town does not dictate precisely where it is they will all end up in life, but Stand by Me is not a film aiming for expansive frills revolving around somebody's entire life story. Instead, effort has been inserted into detailing what goes on in and around the local area of forestry located on the outskirts of said town and how more immediate attitudes can shift. An amusing short-story to do with Vern's inability to find a jar of money he secretly buried in the dirt under his house's porch acts as the catalyst for the film to revolve around these four kids and their venturing out yonder across train tracks and through the countryside in an attempt to find the dead body of a boy whom was supposedly struck down by a train. His brother Billy (Siemaszko), one of a number of gang dwelling bullies headed by Kiefer Sutherland's Ace Merrill, informs a friend of his of said body with Verne underneath eavesdropping.With win of the info; barely enough supplies to see out the journey; a charming script which allows time for these four to bond and share small talk with each other as well as a young, abundance of energy in tow: the boys set off on a trip which they will remember for as long as they are alive. Reiner has them predominantly stick to some train tracks; their doing so in a bid to eventually guide them to their prize a somewhat iconographic deployed. The tracks below them are representative of the firm, formulated, entrenched arc they're on in both a literal and metaphorical sense in that they can lead only to what they discover in the form of the dead body as well as inside of themselves in relation to the journey itself. There are no deviations, not on the permanently fixed road upon which they tread nor the metaphorical road the four of them have landed themselves on: all paths lead to what discoveries must occur up ahead. Under Reiner's careful, watchful and astute direction combined with a worthy screenplay; Stand by Me stands as a wonderful documenting of four young characters undergoing a rounded process of realisation and hardship.


                
This is a movie in hand if you are feeling down. It is bright, innocent, cute and it truly cherishes the meaning of friendship. I found it enjoyable and well acted but still...it is so extremely typical American film, very typical with some light chlicés. The part where one of the boys tells a story was somewhat stupid. Why do so many American films want to add moments of dumb people playing with food and vomiting it out totally un-naturally? I just don´t get it!But don´t get me wrong. The story was a wonderful mix of sunnyness and emotions. I´m sure that expecially young boys will be delighted and why not the whole family? All of the young actors were natural and good. Expecially I was impressed by River Phoenix and Will Wheaton´s performances. They delivered rich emotions and cried painfully real. Yes, they were good.But we must admit that this movie has been made again. The Sandlot, Now and Then (a girl version), Little giants, they all are very similar to Stand by Me. It´s a very enjoyable, colorful, 50´s spirited, cute family film. I give it ***from*****


                
<U+200B>'STAND BY ME' - 1986Directed by Rob ReinerStarring Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'ConnellPlot Overview: <U+200B>After learning that a stranger has been accidentally killed near their rural homes, four Oregon boys decide to go see the body. On the way, Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) and Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) encounter a mean junk man and a marsh full of leeches, as they also learn more about one another and their very different home lives. Just a lark at first, the boys' adventure evolves into a defining event in their lives.It's become apparent of late that I've been watching movies based on Stephen King novellas. I've watched Misery, The Green Mile, 2017 It and now I've got to 'Stand By Me'. With the exception of perhaps 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'Stand By Me' is King's most celebrated film and has received plentiful amounts of critical praise. And after seeing it, I think it's okay. 'Stand By Me' is now means a bad movie and by Coming-Of-Age standards, it is pretty great. But I don't think it deserves the mass praise it receives. I still recommend that you see it because it's still a good film but I certainly don't think that it deserves the massive praise that it receives.As far as pros go, I could name a few. I liked the performances, for a start. Wil Wheaton does a pretty good job as Gordie Lachance, as does his older counterpart Richard Dreyfuss, in narrating the story. Wheaton's peers, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell also do great jobs in bloating out the cast and making the characters come alive.All the cast who played the bullies in the film also did excellent jobs.I also really liked the fact that the story was character driven opposed to story driven. This made each of the character's arcs mean something more and elevated the characters from good to great. The actual story itself was pretty basic and could have used some more adjustments but the overall narrative was strong and engaging, thanks to the characters.Honestly, I have no major flaws with this movie. Everything is at least semi decent but I just didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else did. It's fine but I can't see myself ever watching it again. It was entertaining while it lasted but even now as I am writing this, I am struggling to remember what exactly happened in any logical order. It's an unfortunately forgettable movie and, while I do recommend you see it, I don't really see the critical praise it has received. I'll rate 'Stand By Me' 7 'Dead Bodies' out of 10.


                
Admittedly, this is not a bad movie. Quite the contrary, it's good enough to be reasonably enjoyable. It only wasn't as great as its high reputation suggests.This film is basically about 4 adolescent boys who go on an interesting quest (mostly by foot) to find the body of one of the boys's deceased brother. I gotta admit, it disappointed me a little that their quest was mostly to find a dead body, but the moment I knew it was one of the boys's brother, it made more sense to me. Even though I preferred their quest to be for a different reason, that's not the worst part.What really prevented me from ever seeing this again is the barf sequence. That is disgusting! Couldn't the boy who told that story have told them a different story instead of this crap? I mean, for God's sake! It reminded me of the infamous barf sequence in 'Problem Child 2' (itself an infamous film). The ending is another disillusion: what the boys do with their lives later, how Chris got murdered and the very last scene with a writer and two kids. The very last scene looks artificial - much more like a recent movie and not something from 25 years ago. I also didn't like the character Ace one bit (neither his gang). Pretty much it was these minuses that were a turn off to me, because otherwise it was a good movie although nothing spectacular.The boys's actings were nothing major, but okay. River Phoenix had the best and deepest acting of these 4 boys. He was a talented young actor who left us soon. The fact that his character here dies at the end makes me think of the actor himself because he went to the angels 7 years later.The film's title comes directly from the famous song by Ben E. King but is never once played in the whole movie except in the closing credits.
Like the later Shawshank Redemption (1994), Stand by Me was adapted from a non-horror short story from Stephen King. Also like that film, it has attained a very good reputation over the years. This one was directed by Rob Reiner and is essentially a nostalgia piece set in 1959. It tells a very simple story about four boys who set out on a journey across country to find the body of a dead boy they have heard about. Along the way, they learn things about themselves while also having to contend with a gang of older bullies who also seek the corpse.This is certainly a very well made coming-of-age drama. It is blessed with good dialogue and impressive performances across the board. It also benefits from having no excess fat, with a short running time that avoids any unnecessary detours. It's this very simplicity that is one of the film's strengths. Overall, this is a solid film with good things about it, with its story-line about the quest to see a dead body a somewhat unusual one but one which is strangely effective.


                
This was a pretty good movie and this movie came out 5 years before I was born. It also stars a certain person who Sheldon Cooper was once rivals with. Will Wheaton. lol. This film also takes place during the time when my grandfather was in the navy before he met my grandmother which is really cool and the 50's were cool except for the segregation part. I also know the Simpsons did a reference to this so the Simpsons brought me to watch this film. Family Guy parodied this too. It was also cool when Gordie used that gun to stop those bullies from killing him and his friends. This was a pretty good film based on the Body by Stephen King anyway. Pretty good.
Rating-7/10Stand By Me is a movie about childhood imagination and wonder, but also adolescent pranks and humour mixing it all together to create one nostalgic trip for all those who partake. It has its moments of pure fun and even a little bit of laughter plotted here and there but I did feel the film is overrated, or maybe not but in any case I found it to be pretty good and here below is just why so.Look the plot is firm and is enjoyable and the whole reason they go out on there little adventure is truly a fun time and almost thrilling at certain points. I particularly enjoyed the more sweet moments but also level with the funny bits and so some conversations can go from problems at home or school to Your Momma jokes in three seconds. It has a creative ending and a sweet finale, one which should, and I repeat should leave you with quite a little sweet feeling inside if not slightly saddened.The star of the film is truly River Phoenix who commands and also just generally acts better than the rest, at times he even seems to control not only the other characters but the actors themselves. I wasn't too keen on the performance of Will Wheaton who although of course was a young inexperienced actor back then, still didn't have the knack for being the main actor in the story. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell complete the young boys group and I enjoyed Feldman, annoying character but acted well and he can provide some of the more exciting moments with O'Connell being almost the butt of every single joke.I think Rob Reiner works it well here and he manages to create a piece not only enjoyable but fun, but a kind of fun where it still leaves a bit of emotion to be felt for the people involved. Getting the most out of such a highly acclaimed writers book is not easy I'm guessing and the two writers and Reiner seem to bring this story more or less to life without me feeling "maybe the book is better".It's a sweet bit of fun no denying and I feel it's not just a movie for kids or people who grew up in the time its set in, it also brings a true depth and for it's relatively short running time actually creates a rather slow moving but interesting plot. It isn't new ground whatsoever but with the added bonus of the what the boys are looking for, it means that in the more generic scenes, it remains much more thrilling and mysterious than other films of this type. One particular point is that the plot is not only an adventure along a train track where four guys talk the whole way, they do things and they see things which make it much more enjoyable to us and I can't deny I felt somewhat the same emotion as how the characters felt, a scene involving a bridge with a train track on and Jerry O'Connell come to mind.Overall I felt it to be as I said pretty good and I gave it a 7/10 because although it's nearly a good movie, it just isn't quite there and from what some others have said about seeing this is that it's 10/10, 5 stars etc and I have to disagree. By no means don't see it, it's well worth a look and the acting, writing and directing won't let you down too much plus Richard Dreyfuss is a nice narrator.


                
"Stand by Me" is a movie in which we watch four boys who are best friends trying to find a body of a missing boy. We watch all of these from the eyes of a writer who was one of those kids and after the death of his friend he recounts this trip.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found really good, and the direction of it that it was equally good and made by Rob Reiner. This movie reminded two movies because of its theme. The first movie that it reminded me was the "Sleepers" which I believe has many commons with that one. And the second was the "Mystic River". I also liked very much the interpretation of the little one Wil Wheaton who played as Gordie Lachance and he was simply outstanding in his role, another interpretation that it had to be mentioned is River Phoenix who played as Chris Chambers.Lastly I believe that "Stand by Me" shows us and wants from us to understand how important and strong are the friendships that we had when we were kids. And it wants also to shows us that these friendships can either exist until today or not.


                
Yes this movie provides with some everlasting impressions. Movie that gives each and every single of its shot with a beautiful background scene, natural costume and kidology. To be honest the movie can bore you due to its long looking story which is actually quite short. If one is tired then i am sure he can't watch this movie continuously or without forwarding.But leaving that, this movie will take you to a beautiful journey of four 12-years kids. This light hearted and a bit heart warming movie will make a beautiful and everlasting impression on your mind and may trigger some of your own (relating to and not relating to film) memories. All of this due to its superb filming location and stringed events.


                
I found this film to be a quite solid and entertaining product of Hollywood. However, it was certainly not a work of art and neither a masterpiece of drama. Expect a simple story that is well executed in the traditional Hollywood mold but it is far away from being a truly powerful film and a realistic portrayal of childhood. In fact, the kids in the film look more like adults or kids playing adults in a movie, than actual kids. That is a general problem with films portraying children since adults write the script and therefore they make all the characters act and talk like adults.Try watching Miyazaki's Kiki's Delivery Service for a coming of age film featuring 12-13 year old kids in a much more realistic fashion and also in a much more artistically sophisticated fashion as well.


                
This movie is really good but lets face it its not quite as good as the book being that Reiner made it a lot less dark then the book was. Overall though this movie turned out well definitely one of the better Steven King adaptations. The acting was great from everyone which you don't usually find out of child actors, River Pheonix and Will Wheaton exspecially gave great performances.This movie is about a Man who tells a story of his past. It begins with 4 young boys in a small town in the 1950s. One day they hear of a dead body in the woods somewhere so they decide to go look for it. At first they are having a goodtime but then they become somewhat obsessed with seeing this corpse.This movie was really good but I truly hate Carl Reiner. This is his only good work ever..I hate his movies and I hate everything he stands for. You should not support fascism or Carl Reiner because thats really all he is.


                
I have been looking forward to watching this film for ages, neither because I'm a hardcore zealot of Stephen King, nor I'm a passionate follower of the director Rob Reiner, to me the selling point wholly lays on River Phoenix, a gone-too-soon film star, from James Dean, Sal Mineo, to River till Heath Ledge, whose early demise inexorably grants them a more iconic perception to the mundane world than their remaining peers (sadly it is never too young to die).The film sufficiently charts the bona fide friendship and love among its four protagonists in a simple but accessible framework, the script precisely captures the intrinsic pulse from children's point-of-view, unfortunately and unavoidably, the film itself has to face the judgement from adult's perspective (no film could limit its audience under pubescence), frequently what these kids are doing is corny and slightly obnoxious, which at any rate, exactly reflects a virtually tangible authenticity.The affiliation among the gang-of-four is firmly portrayed by our talented young cast (with endeavored details), River and Will manifest a over-their-ages interpretation to render their characters a multi-dimensional presence; Corey and Jerry are also worthy of a two thumb up applause; besides that, an extremely young Kiefer Sutherland is the will-sales here, who literally creeps me out and unbelievably makes me like the film less by his excellent performance as the leader of the ruffians (who would imagine he could incarnate as Jack Bauer, the federal agent who saves the world numerous times in the TV series 24). By the way, speaking of Will, I really cannot believe he is the one who plays himself in the Big Bang Theory series, although I am not a Star Trek fan either, but he is undoubtedly unrecognizable.


                
More notable for its characters (and the actors who played them) than for its story, "Stand By Me" is a pretty decent piece of movie-making. Taken from a Stephen King short story called "The Body," the movie is a sort of coming of age story that follows four boyhood friends on a camping trip the summer before they enter Junior High. Their goal: to find the body of a classmate who is presumed dead after going into the woods to pick blueberries. The movie is a flashback. It opens with an author (played by Richard Dreyfuss) reading a newspaper account of a friend who had been stabbed to death, and from his reflections on the incident comes this account of one of their adventures. Dreyfuss continues to do voice-over narration throughout the movie.The story isn't really what most interested me, although it does manage to draw the viewer in with characters that are mostly believable and fairly easy to relate to, all of whom have some issues to deal with, not the least of which is that they all seem to feel stuck in one way or another in this drab little town of Castle Rock, Oregon. What's most interesting though - to me anyway - is the look at some very early work by some very young actors, some of whom became very well known. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Casey Siemaszko, Corey Feldman, Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack - they're all in this in the early stages of their acting careers. It's even a fairly early example of Rob Reiner's directing.Essentially it's an entertaining piece of escapism. It's pretty quick, with a running time of less than an hour and a half, and to be honest, even at that there are a few scenes that came across as unnecessary. Overall, though, I'd have to say that this is a winner. 7/10


                
With over 40 reviews posted on this site at the time of this writing, theres not much else to add to everyone elses feelings.  Plain and simple this is just a flat out fun movie.  Many memorable moments involving leeches, Chopper the dog, the barf-o-rama, and of course the "traaaaaaaaain!!!"  All four kids are great in their roles, each with a seperate turn to cry at some point in the film.  Although it was odd that the chubby kid (O'Connell), usually the target of criticisms most of the way, only cried because of the near death experience he had, not because of any emotional problem like the others.  And despite what some say, I think the foul language used could be possible by real life boys, with my view being it depended on your upbringing.  I was one of a quartet who happened to not use those words for fear of being told on, but I've certainly come across younger kids who swear pretty bad, so it all depends.  But as far as the film, its certainly a longtime of fave of most.


                
It's all so clean here, let's start there. It is a bit like The Goonies, but more internal. It is about four kids on adventure, the destination is a dead body deep in the woods which by discovering, they hope to be the heroes of their small town. It's as clean as old Hollywood, in fact much of the framing reminds me of a 1950's film, which is when the film is taking place. Unlike Spielberg's kids, these smoke and curse, but you still know it for what it is, kids acting kids. The acting is clean, movieish. Its narrative and metaphors are clean as can be.It's a fun watch, but the journey is meant to be moreone of growing up, coming to terms with messy adult life and learning to pick yourself up on the way. It's from a Stephen King story. Reiner and King are effective together, if you liked Princess Bride chances are you will like thisit is all a story a grownup writes probably for his own kids to read.So it's fine the way it is, but somewhat narrow from the adult perspective. It is clean as the stories we construct, but not messy like we remember which is a whole other thing, at root one of the fundamental issues of cinema. How do we remember? In a visual way. What does it mean that we do?It's all there, however. So take out the ending that cleanly separates reality from memory from the fiction about it.It's a journey to a dead kid, inevitable future. At least three of the kids have family issues, foreshadowing damaged lives. And as counterpoint, a gang of teenage punks is on their way to the same place, possible future selves.It's all a daydream, triggered by newspaper news of death and two kids on bikes dashing by on a lazy afternoon.Knowing all this, how would you remember?(What's really potent is knowing how River Phoenix, one of the kids here, sought escape from his own life).


                
It had been many years since I had watched "Stand by Me" and after just seeing it again I realized it had been one of my favorites growing up as a kid. Really it's just fabulous a good coming of age story about growing up as when everyone sees they can relate to their childhood of growing up and being with friends and having fun in the summer all along while dealing with acceptance, uncertainty, and just dealing with the journey of life. Rob Reiner who directed does a fine job adapting from Stephen King's novel that's told by a grown adult who's all grown up played by Richard Dreyfuss who tells about the summer of 1959. And when the film flashes back his youth character is played by Wil Wheaton and it tells of his summer journey with his three friends(River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O' Connell)who set across the Oregon landscape of wilderness and timber to search for a dead body of a boy who's been missing. A good turn is given by Kiefer Sutherland who's tough as the local bully. Overall a film of friendship and most important it's about the coming of age and learning thru the experience and journey of life.


                
There's no plot outline in here, come to think of it this is not even actually a real "review"I was 7 years old when Stand By Me was released. I didn't see it right away. I guess I first saw it when I was around the same age as Gordie, Vern, Chris and Teddy. I remember being impressed at the guys' performances, and almost feeling as if I'd just made 4 new friends after seeing the movie.Little did I yet know how profound an impact this film would have on my life. "Coming of age" for any generation is a difficult and confusing time. Things tempt you this way and that, not all of them positive. Suffice it to say, I gave in to most of the negative temptation. In some ways, Chris (River Phoenix) was the character I most identified with as I saw the movie again as a late-teen. But, I also admitted there was a whole lot of Gordie in me too. And just a little Vern...and perhaps even a touch of Teddy. That's what so great about this movie. I was revisiting old friends. At that time, as the movie ended with Chris fading away, was the first time I was to confront demons controlling my life, and say to myself, "maybe I CAN..." I wasn't strong enough until years later, lost in a haze at some god-forsaken hour of the morning, barely waking to that soft tune that opens the film. Somewhere, a memory triggers and I'm back there, in sunny days with the smell of mown grass in my nostrils, chasing that girl with the ribbons and climbing trees, sitting down in front of a hearth-like family TV and watching Stand By Me all those years ago.To credit a simple film with turning my life around for the better would be melodramatic, and inaccurate, but like it's title, this film has "stood by me" for as long as I can remember. I find myself humming that beautifully soft version of Ben E King's famous song for days after I've watched it.And no, I've never had any friends since, like the ones I had when I was 12.
While I enjoyed "Stand By Me", based loosely on Stephen King's childhood recollections, it didn't do anything special for me, other than remind me of my own childhood. Set in 1959, the four boys here are about 12, almost the same age I was in 1959. I, too, had three other friends and we roamed about the neighborhood and the woods, in our own little world mainly absent of grown-up supervision, occasionally getting into small troubles. And, of course, smoking cigarettes pilfered from our parents and using the same type of "salty" language we see in this movie. Very realistic, and very well done. I found the DVD at my local library.SPOILERS. The movie opens in 1985, and we see a lone vehicle on a rural road, inside "writer" Gordie Lachance (Richard Dreyfuss) reads about the death of his old friend Chris and the movie becomes one big flashback to 26 years earlier. The four young friends were Gordie, Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy, and Vern. They were often bullied by the older boys in town, led by "Ace" (Kiefer Sutherland). Chubby Vern is under his porch looking for his own buried treasure of pennies when he overhears his older brother talk about spotting a dead body near the tracks in a remote place. So the boys set out for an adventure, toting camping gear, and head down the tracks. On a trestle bridge, a close call as a train passes. Slugs in the water pool. And finally the body, a boy who had been missing. The older boys show up, and with a gun they brought along, the younger boys chased them off.In many ways that two-day journey changed the way the boys looked at life. We can draw our own conclusions about how the older boys might have taken revenge after everyone was back in town. An interesting story, but a minor movie in my view.
