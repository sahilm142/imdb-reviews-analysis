 A fun film

 a film that opened new doors

 Although I loved the movie. . . .

 Primitive-Looking By Now, But A 'Must" To Set Up The Series

 One of the Most Overrated Movies of All Time

 People say is a masterpiece, i can't understand that.

 About As Good As I Remember

 A mystical western space

 A product of its time. A classic

 Great Flick

 Overrated and outdated

 With All Due Respect, This is Not a Great Movie !

 Rather Good...

 A fantasy well realized....

 a fun flick that spawned too many dire imitators

 Overpopularized, but good

 Where it began

 A good star wars movie.

 May the Force be with you

 it's ok

 Fun, but not a great film

 A great Classic Sci-fi Movie!

 The 3% of DOCTOR STRANGE viewers who stay for the final scene . . .

 Not as overrated as it seems.

 C3PO - That malfunctioning little twerp, this is all his fault.
