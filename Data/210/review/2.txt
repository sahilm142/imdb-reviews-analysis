I got this movie with high hopes, first of all because I enjoy some of Richard Gere's other movies, and second because it was actually rated G! How I would love to see more G movies! The cover on the DVD showed a man happily smiling with his cute dog, so I was anticipating some sort of a happy story.The beginning was kind of intriguing, but as the movie wore on, the music was so slow, boring and sad that I knew that someone was going to to die. I had to force myself to stay with this movie, hoping that it would get better. It didn't.I don't know if was the directing or producing aspect of the film that made it so boring, but there was just something missing.I agree that the real-life story is an amazing and interesting one, but watching this movie version of it was not at all enjoyable for me.
This is not a happy movie, or even an enjoyable one. If you're looking for a sweet movie where the dog does something heroic, forget it. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a movie which meanders along, where a dog waits in vain for his dead owner, and there is no heroic or happy resolution, then this is the movie for you. I understand that this is based on a true story, and real life doesn't always have a happy ending - but that's why real life get embellished: to make it interesting.
