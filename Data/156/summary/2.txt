 One Room Thriller

 Tense and exciting.

 The perfect film for the perfect murder...

 The stage-originated dialogue sings with intelligence, wit, and an easy transition to the screen

 M for masterful

 One of Hitchcock's best thrillers.

 All it is, is plot

 Excellent

 Superior Hitchcock with an exquisite Grace Kelly

 Excellent Hitchcock thriller

 Vastly overrated....

 What does Hitchcock know about women?

 "Do you really believe in the perfect murder? "

 A mean husband concocts an intricate plan to murder his unfaithful wife for her money

 Lukewarm

 A classic stage murder thriller...

 There Is no Perfect Crime

 Key Swapping Balderdash (Spoiler)

 If the name Hitchcock wasn't attached....

 A perfect crime thriller

 Needed a bit more "cinema" and a bit less "stage".

 Unused potential

 Hitchcock plays playfully with plays.

 Space, Distance, Entry

 An enjoyable if stagy thriller <U+0096> more a stage play than an example of classic Hitchcock.
