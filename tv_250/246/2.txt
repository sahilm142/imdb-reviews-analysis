I'll give Julian 1* & Bubbles 1*. I watched 3 or 4 episodes & gave up. Julian is worth watching. Bubbles has potential to be quite funny. Everything else is blah. Nothing to it. Well, the J-Roc guy has potential to be almost as funny as the B-Rad guy in Malibu's Most Wanted, but that's not saying much.Come to think of it, the best line I heard was J-Roc saying "Mom, why you playing me like this in front of my friends."Maybe if I had gone to a newfie school I would think it is funny.
