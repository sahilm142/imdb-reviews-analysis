 V's flashy entertainment is simplistic and unrewarding

 Masterpiece... mutilated!

 Thought provoking! - But I don't mean the plot or the dialogue

 One of the most pedantic, unengaging, and insufferable films I can remember

 utter lameness

 A for Awful, no remnants of Alan Moore's masterwork in "this vicious cabaret"

 V FOR VENDETTA is just sad.

 Nothing spectacular here, utterly emo

 The vendetta is against the audience

 V for Vucking Verrible

 Crapfest 2006 Or: Why We Should Raise Our Standards as an Audience

 I have seen this film

 Overrated

 Alan Moore definitely saves face.

 You've got to be kidding....

 Amazingly Bad Social Commentary Flick

 Stupid

 More of Hollywood's Liberal Propaganda!

 Stylish, but seriously flawed...,

 Unintentionally Funny 1984-Type Movie

 V for Vapid

 Dire

 Little Style, No Substance

 Bad acting, bad writing, predictable ending

 Good movie, bad political message
