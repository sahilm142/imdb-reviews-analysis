 A treasure presented to the viewer

 Terrific acting, screenplay n direction. Bogart was equally good as Huston n in my opinion Bogart's best acting display.

 Just a great movie all around, but a very dark tale

 Still vivid, compact, colorful, and intense, with some acting to, uh, die for.

 "I know what gold does to men's souls."

 Will you stake a fellow American to a meal ??

 A truly fantastic and engaging movie

 A great film with a supberb cast

 Bogart outstanding in this classic film

 Bogie at his best!

 One of the best of All Time

 A Superior Western Story Set In Mexico

 The hearts of men

 "I'll bet you $105,000 that you fall asleep before I do!" 
 Make Sure You Find John Huston's 'Treasure' Trove!

 Bogart's Best Work, A Fantastic Flick

 The treasure that this movie is

 The seeds of mistrust are sown

 Wonderful
