 Superb

 State of the nation, state of the art

 Top Notch!!

 Perhaps the best political suspense series I have seen.

 Possibly the best TV drama ever made

 What A Good Thriller Ought To Be

 Brits have always been best at drama

 Great ride, but something of a con trick

 Fantastic series spoiled by lazy ending

 John Simms is absolutely brilliant in this

 Best TV material I've seen in years

 Good start - bogged down in the middle - so so finish

 The Final Episode Undermines this Taut Drama

 Brilliant. Edge of Your Seat Stuff

 States of Play - A Comparison.

 Extraordinary

 The BBC at its best

 Entertaining but a let-down at end

 State of Anarchy

 Don't watch the movie, go watch the 2003 BBC miniseries

 A top notch BBC miniseries

 Best Series I've Seen For A Very Long Time

 Brilliant

 Can't look away

 Really good BBC material
