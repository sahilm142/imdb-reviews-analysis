 The emperor's new clothes

 Annoying abuse of loyal fans.

 Pretentious And Tedious

 Not the Twin Peaks I once loved

 High reviews early on, but reality sets in that this is overrated trash

 the worst of the worst

 I honestly don't understand why there are such great reviews

 Boring Beyond Belief

 It never peaked, much less blinded me

 Unfortunate

 David Lynch getting too weird for his own good...

 Emperors new clothes.

 Confusing

 How can anyone give this 6+ stars?

 First two episodes may have been good

 Disappointing

 Letdown, to say the least

 Two stars for the acting. Everything else is garbage.

 they ruined twin peaks , this season destroyed the beauty of first ones

 Thanks for ruining my dreams, David.

 Disappointing

 Not so special over rated movie

 This is not Twin Peaks! This is a slap in the face!

 I'm David Lynch. ....

 You can't just revive a successful show from the past
