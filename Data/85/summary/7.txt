 Great Entertainer / but Story and Character holes

 Good, but they overdid it.

 Typical Vidhu Vino Chopra type of Comedy FILM

 Feel Good

 GOOD in comedy but somewhat below expectation!!!

 Good, not outstanding

 A Bollywood for everybody

 Overrated

 Very Funny And One Of The Best Comedies I Have Ever Seen !!

 A good entertainer but over-hyped as usual

 "Aal izz well" with the 3 Idiots!

 All izz very very well :)

 Good. But misses the Bullseye !!!

 3 Idiots definitely tries to do things differently ... to certain extent successfully!

 A hilarious and very much Bollywood conceptualization of 2 stories

 Great entertainment...

 Very joyful movie !

 Another Good Venture from Hirani

 Genius Idiots

 A satisfactory meal, but not the best...

 Some cringy moments here and there, but overall quite bold in its message

 Climax ruins the movie...

 Indian Tertiary Education Depicted Beautifully

 Truly idiotic story setup but very much entertaining.

 Munnabhai Chale College
