No Country for Old Men had a great storyline, character development, acting, and cinematography, and still managed to disappoint me greatly with its crappy anticlimactic ending.What is the purpose of suspense? I couldn't wait to see how the three main characters would interact when they inevitably met. But the Coens yank the rug out from under the audience by suddenly wiping out the protagonist 75% of the way through the movie. Why waste so much time building Llewelyn Moss'(Brolin's) character and emphasizing his resourcefulness if you're going to kill him off so abruptly with no explanation? There's easily an entire scene missing. Fine, I get it: the Mexicans found him. I don't need a rosy ending, but at least reveal how his demise went down. I'm not even asking for a gory shootout sequence; just elaborate on what led up to it. Yes, there is an underlying commentary on fate and humanity, but this movie is also an action/crime thriller where multiple peripheral characters are strangled or blown away by a sociopathic killer. It seems disingenuous to skim over the main character's death. Moss never had a chance, and neither does the viewer.
This film went absolutely nowhere! It was confusing with gaping holes in the story and plot that leave the viewer wondering who people are, how they got to where they are, what really happened, and why. It feels like the Coen bros. ran out of ideas, footage, and money, so they slapped together whatever they had on-hand for an ending.You have to give the Coens credit for artistic style and for building a gripping, gritty experience for the first hour. The film was thoroughly engrossing from the beginning. The acting was excellent. They created a masterful concoction of brutal killer hunting the "little-guy trying to making it big". They get us emotionally invested in the underdog and put us on the edge of your seats routing for the little-guy just to survive. Unfortunately that's about the time things implode. The Coens drop the viewer into a spiral of confusion and reward our emotional investment with nothing. It left me wondering why they released such an unfinished film.Tommy Lee Jones was sadly under utilized. He is an immense talent and screen presence relegated to an impotent, pseudo-supporting roll. His character is irrelevant to the plot and only leaves us wishing he had a bigger part. His closing scene only serves to further the confusion.The true offenders in this debacle are the "Film Critics" and Academy brass who have hyped this mess. Just because the Coen brothers' name is on it does not make it genius.
The movie quickly setup my emotions by the cruel gunshots and merciless killings. I naturally expected something deep out of the blood and bullets. Yet after 2.5 hours of waiting, when the movie ended, I was still waiting. I am sure I was not the only one. Everyone in the movie theater was unwilling to leave. Everyone could not believe the movie had ended. What was the point of all the violence? Maybe this was exactly the main theme of the movie: violence without a reason, but one cannot help be violent. 'You don't need to do it.' Well, I have to say if this was really the deep message to be conveyed, I was totally not moved. Certainly people had to make tough decisions. The hunter chose whether to water the dying men, the killer attempted to give chances to his targets by coin flips. But I just could not feel any real struggles of them. They just made decisions pretty arbitrarily without too much thought. In real world everyone has to make equally serious decisions everyday! Were they special in any sense? The impossible carelessness of the hunter was annoying. Bringing the money using the original suitcase without a check. Sitting upright in front of the door to wait for the enemy's attack. Bold? Illogical? I was also hoping that the movie would tell more about the virtual and the reality related to the cop. Got much less than I expected.
When some movies are over, everything is tied up in a neat little package; for better or worse, someone worked really hard to make sure there were no unanswered questions. Other movies aren't so considerate. Others may be messy, but the good ones leave you asking key questions about the philosophy of the story. They may make you wonder "What would I do in that situation?" "Was the hero really a hero?" "Do I agree with the film's moral?" etc. These films draw you into the story, to the point where the ending is really the beginning of the film's lasting power. Sometimes messy is good.Bad ones, however, leave you questioning the story itself: "Why did he do that?" "What happened to so-and-so?" "Did that make any sense?" "What did I miss?" Such films make you see the holes in the plot, not the story that surrounds them. When the film is a huge critical or commercial success, the pertinent question may well be "So, what's the big deal?" NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a "so-what's-the-big-deal" type of movie. It is undoubtedly THE film of 2007, an Oscar-winning, critic's choice, top ten darling. Yet, for the most part, it is an utterly conventional modern day western; so predictable that Charles Bronson could be resurrected from the grave and plopped down into the middle of it without missing a beat. It is adequately directed and decently acted, but otherwise -- for the first two-thirds -- it is largely without distinction. Perhaps, because the filmmakers work so hard to seem unconventional in the last third, the defenders think they see something unique in the whole.The set up is routinely plotted: A poor, but relatively honest young man, while hunting in the west Texas desert, stumbles on a drug deal gone bad. While callously rooting around amidst the dead bodies, he helps himself to over two million dollars in illicit cash. He takes off and is soon pursued by a relentless, but relatively insane mob assassin -- and they are both -- sorta -- pursued by an honest, but relatively ineffectual local marshal. Leaving a predictable trail of dead bodies along the way, the film seems to be promising a confrontation where any two or more of the protagonists should face each other in a traditional showdown.At least, that is how the writing/directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen set things up. It could be argued that Coen brothers are playing around with the audience, mischievously creating expectations that they have no intentions of meeting. But in side-stepping the obvious tried and true plot twists and dramatic confrontations that such a climax normally would offer, the Coens don't really replace them with anything better. The last third of NO COUNTRY is shocking and challenging only because it is so vapid and devoid of drama. Characters die off-camera with only the vaguest explanation, while other characters' fates are left an obtuse mystery. The finale peters out into three separate and pointless conclusions: the thief dies, the killer apparently gets away and the policeman quits, never to cross each other's paths. And the audience isn't given much reason to care about any of them.The anemic narrative wouldn't matter so much, I suppose, if the film were instead a incisive or compelling study of one or more of the characters. Though the actors give decent enough performances, they can't flesh out the characters beyond ciphers. Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, the hunter turned thief, is a solid presence, a modern day twist on the iconic figure of the strong, silent and resourceful cowboy. But beyond the good-boy-gone-bad tradition of the western, the film gives Llewelyn little backstory and no particular depth beyond being both foolish and yet smarter than one would expect. Ed Tom Bell, the gruff, world-weary, retirement-bound, small-town sheriff, is played by Tommy Lee Jones as a safe and comfortable stereotype; only denied by the uninspired script either the traditional age-cultivated wisdom or the opportunity to be even vaguely heroic. He spends most of the film wistfully longing for the good old days.Javier Bardem's much praised work as the tiresomely inscrutable and indestructible hit-man Anton Chigurh is largely a one-note performance -- Oscar win notwithstanding. His persistence, in lieu of any personality, has been inexplicable interpreted as having mythic dimensions as the embodiment of cruel fate or death incarnate. Only desperation to find meaning in the slight story justifies such heavy-handed symbolism. Lumbering through the film with all the emotional complexity of a slasher movie serial killer, Chigurh is little more than a lazy gimmick; with his over-sized weapons (one requires he lug around a 30-pound tank of compressed air!) and arbitrary flip-a-coin sadism, he is a ludicrous character who survives only due to the manipulations of a generously contrived script.But, it is no wonder the film focuses on Chigurh, who like Coens' films, embodies a cold, dispassionate emptiness. It is not that they don't do compassion (let alone passion) well, they don't even try. In their best effort, BLOOD SIMPLE, the chill of their drama is counteracted with a coy air of satire. Even FARGO is unpleasantly empty as far as emotional depth. You can tell a lot about filmmakers by how they treat even their minor and incidental characters; most characters in Coen films are disposable plot devices. It is no wonder a key character is killed off screen; the Coens don't care about his fate and assume we shouldn't either.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN builds to one of the least satisfying conclusions of all time. The film is ultimately riddled with gaps in logic and figure-it-out-for-yourself ambiguities; things that the audience may not need to see, but have a right to expect to experience as part of the drama. NO COUNTRY isn't just weak film-making, it is an act of bad faith. The final question facing the viewer might well be "Is that it?"
The "Incoherent Brothers" can go straight to hell for foisting this pretentious, boring mess on us! And maybe they'll take the scores of fawning critics, some otherwise respectable (et tu, Peter Travers?), along with them.While I swore off All Things Coen many years ago (Fargo being their one, though naturally overrated, saving grace), I thought I'd give them another chance when I witnessed the flood of critical praise that followed the release of "No Country for Old Men", especially when this one was purported to be unlike anything the filmmakers had released to date. That's not entirely true, by the way. Style-wise, this film is really just a remake of Fargo, only more annoyingly executed.So what's the problem? For one thing, all the damnable Coen trademarks are here: cloyingly hip dialog unlike any you'll ever hear in real life; subtle, and not so, deeper meanings permeating the script, just daring you to "not get it" along with the unwashed masses of simple film-goers who appreciate movies with a beginning, a middle and an end (What, you don't get the in-jokes? What an A-hole you are!); a camera that lingers on characters for interminable lengths of time while they drone on and on; a smattering of pointless ancillary characters that advance the plot not one single bit, etc.Added to the mix is Tommy Lee Jones, as the stereotypical small town sheriff (How original!), playing the same Texas character he's tackled in any number of other movies, who does absolutely nothing but talk (and talk, and talk) his way through the film, spewing countless homespun aphorisms and stories about whogivesacrapall to his hapless deputy and anyone else who'll listen. Done to death years ago were the requisite interludes in films like these where a southern-fried character waxes poetic for several minutes at a time, offering the audience some symbolic words of wisdom designed to illuminate some plot point or other. But, as usual, nothing comes of it here, and the Coens do it to a fare thee well. (If I never hear another gratuitous redneck soliloquy in a movie, it will be too soon: "My daddy once said..." Oh, screw you!).Saved from sucking completely, the film can boast of a creepy villain, played with subtlety and style by Javier Bardem, who reminds me of an understated Raul Julia. His performance is guaranteed to stay with you long after the closing credits. One wishes more screen time had been devoted to his unsettling assassin.The greatest sin a filmmaker can commit is leaving the audience bored. The Coen brothers do that more than a few times throughout the course of this picture. Unnecessary attention is devoted to such details as an injured man dressing his wounds after a gun battle, and the aforementioned pointless monologues among characters, while the fate of the film's central character is decided off-camera, with a puzzling, and highly unsatisfying result for the audience.Then, to make matters worse, and perhaps showing that the director doesn't watch TV, anyone familiar with the obnoxious and controversial ending of a certain popular cable show last summer will recognize the unceremonious way in which this film ends, leaving the theater's audience scratching their heads at the screening I attended. Pissing off your audience: Always a bad idea! What a shame. This movie had some true potential. Despite the few gripping scenes, the film lets it all slip away and squanders whatever promise it might have had. No real entertainment value here.Maybe the Coens should join forces with the other siblings who have no business making movies--the Farrrelys and Wachowskis. Between the lot of them, perhaps a coherent script might emerge. They may need to start making movies separately, or pairing up with other people to see what fresh ideas might result from such a partnership.I do know this: I've sat through my last time-waster from these guys, and I'd consider returning only when they've created something other than the same tired retread of their past efforts. Vaya Con Dios, Joel and Ethan!
For me, this was the biggest disappointment of the year. I just set my expectation level too high. I guess I was looking forward to some Fargo-type humor mixed in with the gratuitous violence. I guess it's not fair to compare this to Fargo, because that movie did raise the bar. This one lowered it back down again. The plot was decent enough and certainly there was enough killing and blood to go around. Film is not funny, not gut-wrenching and way to slow. Word of mouth may kill, pardon the pun, box office sales as about 90% of the audience I was part of had only negative comments. And the ending speaks for itself (which means it says nothing). Sorry Coen Bros.
I honestly can't tell what they were thinking when they did this. The script is a mess, full of afterthoughts and misfires and very short on any sort of actual point or significance. It just sputters along with stabs of pointless violence and splashes of awkward humor that are mostly based on casting ugly people and then making them sound stupid. The bad guy is Freddy Kruger with a Prince Valiant haircut, Tommy Lee Jones is wasted, Woody Harrelson is (pardon) wasted, a lot of really nice scenery is wasted. It isn't even particularly well shot despite the fact that it is the often-brilliant Roger Deakins. Joel and Ethan Coen have made two of my favorite films and others I have enjoyed, but this is just sadly wrong.
If you don't like violence, steer clear of this film.As I watched this film I was reminded of some of the Stephen King novels I've read; kill off the characters until there aren't enough to sustain the story and then find a cheesy way out.But that gives too much credit to this film. Upon reflection, it appears as if someone lost the screenplay during filming and they began just "winging" it until they arrived at the last scene when TL Jones has his epiphany about the dream of his father. *cut* *print* Okay, everyone; time to go home.I guess I'm an old-fashioned kind of film-buff who like a story that makes sense beyond the first hour or so of the film.I'm giving the film a 3 (out of 10) simply because it provided an interesting waste of time for a good part of the evening. Maybe it's a "3" because of what could have been; otherwise I would have rated it lower.
I kind of feel like I've been taken out on a date by some chick way out of my league who leads me on through the night then dumps me at the end for someone else. A part of me still wants to like her (this movie) because it showed such great potential. Both the main character, the Nam vet Moss, and the villain were impressive in their resourcefulness without being typical, over-the-top, Hollywood-style heroes and anti-heroes. I wasn't too impressed with either Woody Harrelson's or Tommy Lee Jone's characters, but they were secondary to the main contest. I was looking forward to the actual showdown though. Instead, Moss is killed by banditos, a scene which we are deprived of for some reason. The villain later kills Moss's wife and then, after an unrelated car crash, stumbles away and we never find out his ultimate fate. After the death of Moss and his wife (I still wasn't even sure at that point if Moss was really even dead), I thought, 'Ok, now it'll come down to a showdown between Tommy Lee Jones and the villain. Surely, he won't let him get away with killing the sweet, innocent wife." Guess again! Instead, what we are treated to is this drawn out exploration of Tommy Lee Jone's internal and external relationships as he decides to call it quits! WTF is up with Hollywood?! Last weekend, I made the mistake of watching King's crapfest, defeatist "Horror" flick, The Mist, where all the main heroes have a suicide pact at the end rather than take their chances and fight to survive against the monster bugs. This weekend, I was treated to another defeatist ending where the aging sheriff calls it quits and decides to enjoy his pension rather than put his life on the line to kill this psychopath. Wow, there's some inspiration for the next generation... What's next? Harry Potter kills all his friends at Hogwart then himself?! 3 stars for the first 3/4 of the movie P.S. Yes, I understand "real life" doesn't always work out but I didn't need to waste $12 bucks and 2 1/2 hours to have it pointed out again for me. Thanks anyway.
Yes, three stars. This film is a miserable waste of time, and don't let the other 'fooled' reviewers, the swooning Academy who wasted three (of the four) Oscars on it, or anyone else tell you otherwise. Just because a movie is confusing, unexpected, amoral, cynical and bleak, and yes, hell, doesn't have a happy ending - just because it's DIFFERENT from 99% of the other junk that Hollywood spews out - just because you maybe don't understand it, doesn't mean it's a great movie. Go with your gut instinct (if you've seen it). The movie DOESN'T HAVE AN ENDING, happy or otherwise. Imagine if Blade Runner Director's Cut, never mind restoring the controversial Unicorn Dream Sequence, actually ended on that? If Arnie in T1 had killed Sarah Connor and walked away, while the Police Captain had decided he was just too old to be bothered? I mean, who watches a movie for that? A waste of $5.99 for FIOS HD. I want to clear the air here a little by saying that the Coens directed (and more importantly perhaps, wrote) one of my all-time favorite movies, Miller's Crossing. I don't have a problem with extreme violence - Starship Troopers, Hard Boiled, Platoon, Natural Born Killers, Rollerball - all excellent, but they had a point to make, a beginning, middle and end. Unlike this bag of old shite. Let's be clear, there's no mysterious insight into human nature here, just a profoundly depressing lack of ideas, dressed up as Texas-noir art-house nihilism. You want to hear about real senseless violence? Read your local newspaper. Read about the psycho guy in Louisiana who threw his three kids off a bridge to drown. Read about the millions slaughtered in Rwanda or Congo or pretty much everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa in the last ten years for no particular reason. That's emptiness. Real-life, meaningless, depressing death-into-nothingness. I don't need Hollywood to give me the fake deal. So which Oscar did it deserve, IMHO? Bardem, for being a great edge-of-your-seat psychopath. The problem is the plot, the point, or lack thereof. I'm sorry to have to be the little boy who stands up in the crowd and contradicts everyone else on the planet who just doesn't want to be the one to look stupid, by not understanding some work of genius. But the Emperor really does have no clothes.
To call this film an elegy to a simpler, more civilized society, would be, well, too civilized. If you want a good in-depth analysis of the nihilistic message of this film, read this review: http://tinyurl.com/33eer8 The time for this movie (and the recent book it was based on) was 30 years ago. Then, it would have been an insightful social commentary. Anyone paying attention to the world since that time has received the director's message loud and clear, over and over, just by watching or reading the news. It's clear that the world has become a more savage place, that individual efforts to resist the downward spiral are futile. To shoot at, stomp on, and rip up the bloody corpse of a civilized society is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the conversation.As entertainment, the film fails, too. There are no real people in this film, only stock types: the naive, greedy, sap, the overmatched lawman, the unstoppable bad guy, the sensible western wife, the scummy Mexican jackals. There is no one to engage with, sympathize with, or be terrified of, because everyone in the movie is just a caricature. The CG character of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings had more substance than the hyperviolent hit man in this flick.As a result, crackerbarrel philosophy is passed off as sage insight, and cruel violence is passed off as a good time. At least Pulp Fiction, this movie's closest cousin, had wit and characterization. The fawning reception of this movie by critics and moviegoers angers and baffles me.


                
i saw all the great reviews, and maybe walked in expecting a lot, but i certainly was disappointed. seemed mean-spirited to me. quite apocalyptic, with the anti-Christ walking among us - which maybe isn't my favorite theme. guess i was expecting a thriller and got a horror movie.what bothered me the most was the sheriff. very likable in his wit and his eloquence. then totally inept. lazy, foolish, no ability to use other law enforcement personnel. and worst of all is that he's wonderfully intuitive: he keeps telling stories that should give him clues to the killer (compressed-air cow guns, return to the scene of the crime, the dreams about his father), but then he doesn't use his intuition to solve anything.i love detectives with intuition, but i count on them to use it wisely. here, intuition is a terrible thing to waste.


                
I am really surprised by the critics' admiration for this film. I am not so surprised at the reaction of the Tarantino fan types that have rated this film so highly on the IMDb. A film with this much graphic violence (I counted Anton's tally at 14, but maybe I missed some) better have some good points to make -- and any more, they should be NEW points -- or else it's just a horror film. I am afraid that the Coens have come up with a horror film. Okay, but then I don't understand how the critics can get so worked up (of course, I thought they were way too kind to Little Children also).Essentially, as some other readers have so rightly pointed out, this film is pointless. The insults of other readers --- that those of us who believe this are dumb --- doesn't hold water. I have discussed the film with a number of friends who are great fans of cinema (and I mean they have an appreciation of the classics of world cinema), and they also had to agree. And we are fans of the Coens, and feel that they make interesting films with great dialog, settings, acting, and photography. In fact, I cannot fault the film technically. The problem is with the story itself, which means that either Cormac McCarthy failed, or the Coens did in adapting it.So I invite other readers to explain what points are made here that we haven't already seen a zillion times in other films. The relentless evil of man? The ultimate meaninglessness of existence? Do we really need this much blood to do so?Sigh. Okay. How about this? The Coens have attempted to adapt what I suppose is a serious American novel to the screen. However, if that is the case, I shouldn't have to accept the usual suspension of disbelief. Thus, how is it that this ultimate killing machine was apprehended by the not-so-bright deputy in the first place? We first see Anton in custody - - handcuffed as it were. From then on, this psycho has essentially killed everyone he has chatted with. That was a major loose end for me.Another friend considered the film a rip-off of The Terminator, which he says in turn was a stolen idea. Even down to the scene where Anton has to repair himself.Other critics have called the film "funnier than Fargo", which if true, is pretty distressing. In the theater I was in, there were indeed chuckles in the appropriate spots, but when I saw Fargo, people were laughing loud and hard throughout. To imagine a theater audience doing so with this film is downright chilling.


                
I thought this movie would be really good because it has won many rewards. I watched it and I'm glad I borrowed it instead of buying or renting it because I would want my money back. It showed the same crap over nd over again. The storyline was cheap and dull. The ending in my opinion was crap. The only positive thing in this movie was the violence. I seems to me that the creator of this move didn't spend much money to make this movie. Also it seemed they like dead dogs because they kept showing a dead dog at the scene of the killings and they showed the man killing a dog later. I'm not saying I'm a animal rights activist but its messed up they would show things like that. I recommend that if you want to see this movie do not buy it just rent it. Or even borrow it form a friend.
AlI have to say, is Overrated Much, pretentiousness has reached an all new high, if this is the best or even top ten of the year. If this is what is applauded and passes for a good movie, staying at home and watching The Hills or Laguna Beach looks more tempting, or maybe even watching paint dry .the people who saw the movie, and claim to have found some new found meaning to life,or Oh The movie was so deep you did not understand it and is the best movie of the year, best movie of the decade, best movie of the century, yadda yadda. It kinda feels like the emperor's new clothes when the emperor get's a designer to make him a costume, the man makes him an imaginary costume, the emperor walks around naked all day, and he says and people around him say if you can't see the clothes then you must be stupid, so everyone praises the clothes and calls it the most beautiful and magnificent they had ever seen since the since the creation of sliced bread, afraid to admit that they could not see them,for fear of not wanting to sound stupid or wanting to feel more intellectual than they actually are until a small child point's out and says, "But he has nothing on!".please, I Beg of You, "Save Your Money", you'll thank me later if you are so curious wait it out and rent it on DVD, do not be deceived by the hype, do not be deceived by the golden globe nominations.


                
I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but i've gotta say I was seriously disappointed by it all. After hours of watching I couldn't help the feeling it was all a case of style-over-substance.The plot had a lot of promise... Nice (but hard-ass) guy finds a bag full of drug money, and gets chased by a psycho trying to get it back. But it never lives up to its potential. And the repetitive disbelief of Tommy Lee Jones Character, really has nothing to do with the main plot of the film.I know the point of the whole thing was supposed to be less of an action film and more of a thoughtful one, but I don't think the trade-off worked. And the ending was just a "WTF" moment... a lot of people in the cinema broke into laughter at the end, at disbelief of how it finishes.The only redeeming feature of this film is Javier Bardem (who was exceptionally good at playing the psychopathic killer). But apart from the scenes involving him, the rest of the film just felt like it was trying to fill the empty space until he came back on screen. Josh Brolin also played his role well... in fact.. all of the acting was good in this film... but it just doesn't manage to pull it together.


                
This movie is riddled with plot holes. So much is left unexplained and so many things are unrealistic.**Spoilers*** Movie starts with Chigurh being arrested. It's never explained why he's arrested, but he kills the officer that arrested him. My guess is they just wanted a "cool" murder scene to the start movie.Llewelyn stumbles on a drug deal gone wrong. There's dead Mexicans everywhere, a truckload of drugs and a missing briefcase with millions of dollars in it. One Mexican is still alive, but he's dying from his gunshot wound. Llewelyn tracks down the missing briefcase and goes home... and then for some reason he decides to return to the crime scene to give water to the dying Mexican (wouldn't he be dead by now anyway?). You'd think Llewelyn would know someone would be missing a truckload of drugs and millions in cash... but no, he pulls up to the crime scene in his truck with his headlights on in the middle of the night. Very discreet...Later Chigurh visits the crime scene with two other gentlemen. How does he know about the drug deal? what's his involvement in it? who is he with? How does Chigurh know Llewelyn is going to Del Rio? the transmitter wasn't giving any signals until he drove into Del Rio so he couldn't have known if he was driving in the right direction up until that point.In the middle of this mess comes our new character Carson Wells. Hired by someone in an office. We don't find out who he is... in the credits he's named "man who hires Wells".Carson somehow finds Llewelyn across the Mexican border in a hospital. It's not explained how he finds him.Carson finds the briefcase with the money. Does he take it? nope, he returns to his hotel instead and gets killed by Chigurh.Llewelyn is then killed off-screen and so is his wife. Towards the end of the movie sheriff Tom Bell chats with a fat guy in a diner and then an older man in a wheelchair. Not much is known about these characters.Add to this the fact that Chigurh can go around killing people seemingly at will without much response from any law enforcement agency. You'd think there would be police controls, road blocks and a huge manhunt for a man who has just murdered a police officer and several other people. Not to mention the big oxygen tank that Chigurh is carrying with him everywhere. The officer at the start of the movie even describes the oxygen tank to another officer over the phone. Shouldn't be that difficult for the police to spot Chigurh.This movie does not deserve 8.3 stars.
There is a saying: a movie is only as good as its ending, which makes this movie not bad, but certainly not that good. It's as if the creators of this movie had decided that they would try to out-do The Mist for the worst ending of an otherwise interesting movie for the year 2007. Also, this movie brings to mind another good movie, The Last King of Scotland, in that how "Scotland" shows how a murdering tyrannical dictator isn't such a bad guy, "No Country" tries to make the same case for a serial murderer who systematically murders only bad guys. I guess tyrannical dictators and serial killers have their stories too. When trying to dramatize the behavior of seriously mentally deranged persons, such as serial killers, Hollywood sometimes does a good job. Case in point: Taxi Driver, which offers a compelling story about a troubled young man who kills. In Cold Blood is another excellent movie of that genre. This movie does not even come close to those movies in terms of quality or storytelling. Tommy Lee Jones is lost in this movie. He is entirely miscast. The actor who plays the main protagonist, the psychopath who goes around killing, gives a great performance as long as he does not talk, which is not his fault because the dialog is weak. Nevertheles, the movie does have its fascinating features and is watchable but with one caveat: be prepared for is just one weak ending. One other point: This movie portrays law enforcement has being easily duped and completely ineffective despite the presence of massive evidence that provides an almost inexhaustible supply of solid leads. What's even more ridiculous is the portrayal of the sheriff as being practically the only law enforcement agent involved in this case when in reality such a high-profile case, involving multiple murders of foreign nationals along or near a border, would have a virtual army of federal, state, county and local officials assigned to it. They'd being practically fighting each other over who would have final jurisdictional authority. But these kind of facts do not necessarily make for good fiction, so there's one sheriff - that's it - trying to deal with a serial killer, and this sheriff is planning to retire! Can you blame him? Yeah ... right. Duh. Here's another take on this movie. Maybe this movie is Hollywood's way of portraying the plight of the seriously mentally ill with violent dispositions. Remember, friends, this is Hollywood that we're talking about, not some mental health organization, and if Hollywood thinks something will sell, it will play it up to the hilt. No subject, no matter how sensitive, is off limits, and it seems that with this movie, Hollywood has decided that "mental illness" is in. Of course, once Hollywood gets a hold of the subject the powers-that-be, using literary license, will transform that subject into something that is almost totally unrecognizable from the original subject. In the case of "mental illness", Hollywood portrays it as something sinister, uncontrollable and a threat to society. Now if this sells, then who's to complain? Then again, it may be appropriate if the movie includes this proviso: "Any depictions of mental illness in this movie may not conform with actual facts."


                
5 out of 10 is generous, my thoughts on this film have shifted, from at one point considering it one of the top five of the year to now considering it to be a film full of exaggeration and hyperbole.I respect the Coens, I loved Fargo and Raising Arizona, they seem to be in a world all of there own. The problem is sometimes its not worth taking the ride with them, they seem to be exploring cinematic terrain and while that is notable you have to understand that there will be some wrong turns. No Country for Old Men is one such wrong turn, they seem to almost be toying with the audience, finding joy in making an almost completely backwards movie. Pay no attention to the trailer it will tell you nothing.You think this movie revolves around Brolin, it actually is a film with three leads, Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. Eventually shifting to Jones near the end.I know there's symbolism, and some of it is meant to be deep. I know this, but I just didn't like the film. Sometimes a film is praised just for being unusual, and this is certainly the case here.


                
I watched this expecting an intelligent action drama, with fantastic acting and immersive plot. I was totally disappointed. I think this movie must be among the worst I have seen. First I was extremely bored and annoyed. The plot is of a typical action movie featuring Steven Seagal. What's different is that there are moments of long silence and static scenes. Like you would expect from an intelligent drama. And well, there's nothing intelligent about this movie. This is somehow due to the fact that you don't get emotionally involved with any character. That because you don't know anything about themIt's an extremely confusing movie. You don't know what does the guy intend to do with the money, who the hell are those Mexicans, whats up with the maniac killing everybody, who is that maniac by the way, who is the guy popping up in the middle of the film, why doesn't he take the money etc. I didn't even understand the main guy had been killed firstly. Characters just pop up out of nowhere and disappear just as suddenly.There is also some boring sheriff there, meditating about life and telling stories of his father. Maybe I just didn't understand the movie. There are a few persons that told me they liked it. Maybe in those long moments of silence and boredom I should've been impressed or something. But it's hard to be touched when the only thing that ever happens is someone else getting killed. I think it's one of those movies: you love it or hate itJust to clarify, as I said a few times about how boring it was. I am not saying I wanted an action movie with big booms and crazy gunfire. I am saying there were moments when I was thinking : "ok , now I should cry or what?! get on with the next scene!"The only thing I liked about the movie was the acting of Javier Bardem. he created a great character.
Gruyere! Maybe it was meant to be humorous. Some kind of post-modern skit on dim Americans as seen from, perhaps, a French point of view.****************SPOILERS*********************Maybe it was just rubbish.Otherwise, let's do a bit of Fisking:1. Why did Llewellyn go back to the scene of a massacre where he knew that a) 2 million dollars had been left lying around b) a huge quantity of drugs had been left on the back of a pickup c) when the drug gang member he'd left some 10 hours earlier was practically dead anyway 2. Why did he hide the money in the air-conditioning system just so he could take it out by going into another room? 3. Why did he tie the rope to the case with the money in it when he was going to improvise some silly device made from coat hangers which didn't use the rope? 4. Why did the killer know that Llewellyn would go to Del Rio? Not, say, El Paso, Houston, LA, Seven Lakes North Carolina or Disneyworld? Let alone, Australia, Borneo, Malaysia, Scotland, the Faeroes, Tierra del Fuego...5. Del Rio, TX "has a population of 33,867 with 11,895 housing units", but the killer managed to drive past the one location where his transponder detection device would notice? That was jolly lucky! 6. Why were the Mexicans at the motel virtually unarmed and why were there three of them in a room? (I've never been there, but I get the impression that all Mexicans must be murderers and gangsters, I wonder who runs the restaurants) 7. How did the killer know where to find Llewellyn in the second town (I've forgotten its name, was it El Paso?), and at which hotel (most American towns, even small ones, have lots of places to stay, perhaps you get a discount for staying at the 'Hotel for Potential Murder Victims', or 'Hotel Feeble Plot Device') 8. Why was the transponder a) so poorly hidden, surely a decent drug gang would have hidden it in the fabric of the case rather than sticking it between a few notes on the top layer. 9. Why was the transponder flashing? Surely you'd want to keep the power consumption to a minimum - I was surprised it wasn't going BEEP BEEP too. 10. What kind of idiot sits right behind the door than an armed murderer is coming through? (Hint - Llewellyn), a smart murderer with a silenced gun might even put a couple of bullets through first in case there's someone sitting etc.11. As others have remarked, do the Texas police regard the murder of one of their colleagues as of no more significance than a parking offence? 12. Why was there only one policeman in the whole of Texas? (I suppose there were two deputies as well, but both of these were certifiable idiots and there was a fat guy late on, but what he was for is a mystery), have the FBI / DEA etc been closed down while no-one was looking? 13. Can you just walk over the border into Mexico, are all Mexican border guards permanently asleep or is this just another witty racial slur (surely he should have had a sombrero and a big moustache and have a radio playing 'La Cucaracha'))? 14. Do the nice Mexicans always wake up American bums with a nice Mariachi band in the morning? (Is this what the non-gang members do?) 15. Are Mexican hospitals all free for Americans? Someone should tell Obama so he could sort out US health care by just saying 'Go South, the Mexicans will fix you up for no charge.' Didn't anyone tell the US consulate in Juarez that one of their citizens was all shot up and in hospital - obviously the 'Murderers and stupid Gunmen's' news service is much better than the US government can manage. 16. I suppose it proves that Mexicans really are stupid by the fact that we all know (from watching this film) that all you have to do to get into the USA is to say 'I was in Vietnam'(Point of information - would this have worked for ex-Viet Cong too?) and check out when some unit was there - you even get a lift into town... Why do they all try to go through the desert? Silly people. 17. How did Carson Wells and Chigurh both work out where Llewellyn had gone? He'd told no-one, even his girlfriend had no idea and there was no compelling or even uncompelling reason given, and it seemed as though he was just trying to find the most difficult place to move around unconstrained? Given that a) all the dead people in the initial scene were Mexican, b) he knew that people were after him, and that c) they were Mexican, why not go, oh I don't know, north, to somewhere like, I don't know Fargo, North Dakota, where there aren't many Mexicans and the local police might take some interest at a van full of men in sombreros waving guns and no doubt shouting 'Arriba arriba!' while dancing on their hats and beating up a toy donkey. Besides a pregnant Frances McDormand is a much better bet than a mumbling Tommy Lee Jones if you want protection. 18. In fact, why wait anywhere? A 48 hour drive will take you a long way (say 16 hours a day at 60-65 mph - that's 1000 miles a day - Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, etc), and you don't really need to stay in a nice unsafe motel overnight. OK, I've decided. It was rubbish.


                
After checking out the rating on here and seeing an impressive 8.3/10 I thought I would settle down to a evening of IMDb recommended entertainment. After a semi promising start I endured a further 90 minutes of anticipation.. no make that expectation mixed with mind numbed disappointment. Surely it had to go somewhere, ah, right we're off.. no wait someone just killed him off?, who she, who are they, are they coming back? What a complete waste of 2 hours! The rental shop must have slipped the wrong movie in the box, right? I watched one where a psycho, mop haired Mexican had an interesting auto shotgun with a silencer (new one on me) lots of blood and not a lot else really!Judging by all the votes from sub 18's to over 50 year olds I thought this is bound to be one heck of a film, especially as the Coen's were involved.. Oh boy was i wrong. Worst thing I kept saying to myself 8.3/10, it must get better or at least have a plst soon?


                
I have no clue on earth how this movie won ANY awards, or how its rating is so high. It boggles my mind how so many people can think it was a "brilliant masterpiece." It makes me think that everybody has been waiting for a boring, waste of time film for a long long time now.I had to check it out because of all of the good things I have heard about it, even though I wasn't too sure what the plot of the movie was. About half way through, I found myself trying to pick out points to like, so I can maybe relate, but I failed. I was watching with a friend, so I wanted to act interested so I wasn't in the minority of people who didn't think it was "great." As it turns out, he looks at me and says, "Is this movie going anywhere?" Bottom line, I found it a waste of time, and it was complete and absolute boredom.


                
I've learned to really not care about the IMDb ratings.But i have never been so shot down by a film with such a high rating.I decided to see this film because of all the hype.I admit i'm not a Cohen fan.I stopped enjoying their films from Fargo and on.But NCFOM is a perfect example of a bad movie. Hidden under a pseudo-philosophical veneer is a movie with practically nothing to offer.No serious plot,no serious characters (Tommy Lee Jones did his best but what more could he have done with this material?) and certainly nothing exciting about the way it was filmed.Just because some of the greatest filmmakers filmed their movies with a slow pace (i heard a lot about comparing Kubrick with the Cohens....are you guys serious?)it doesn't mean that if you film with a slow pace you'll make a good movie. All in all NCFOM became one more example of why the Oscars mean absolutely nothing.


                
I was pretty much bored stiff by this film. We learn nothing about the important characters, and the only character we could care about, the Tommy Lee Jones character, is so removed from the action, that caring about him doesn't matter.The pacing is not only deadly, but never varies when the situation gets more intense, or when the situation is not critical. There is none of the Coen Brothers trade mark 'quirkeness' to any of the characters, and tho the Javier Bardhem character may be 'a man on a mission' we never know why, or get a clue as to what makes him tick. I am shocked that this film has met with such enthusiasm, and can't believe Bardhem is nominated for his one level performance. And further surprised that he is nominated as supporting actor, when he is on screen for most of the film.Bring back Fargo and Oh Brother. Now those were the Coen's at their best. Mostly with this film I was bored stiff. No character, no relationships, no suspense, and no pacing. A not very good film from two talented film makers. Why did you like the film, is my question to all those enthusiastic viewers. My friend said, "I was on the edge of my seat the entire time." But, with such lousy pacing, and no clue as to who anyone was, I couldn't have cared less.
