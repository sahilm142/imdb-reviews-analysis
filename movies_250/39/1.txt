Black guy takes care of white guy. Black guy is poor and white guy is rich. They teach each other how to live better. Isn't it touching? Oh my God, I'm weeping right now, while I write these lines... NOT! This film is pathetic and the only way to explain the high ratings and its success is through the fact that most people are easily touched by stories that are sentimental and about friendship and moral values. Similar to why Paulo Coelho's books are bestsellers, for example.To compare: Little Britain's Lou and Andy are funny exactly because they are not trying to teach you a moral lesson or show you how important it is to have a friend or help someone.Simple story. Cliché. Sentimental. Boring.


                
I am not an American, and yet I found the movie to be utterly racist (as did sections of American society).The movie is racist, not because a black man is serving a white man, but because an impression is created that no black man could ever appreciate Vivaldi. Of course, the pill is sweetened by balling all this up in humor directed at the white man's tastes, instead; but in the end all of this serves only to reinforce the stereotypes in society. Among all those people sitting at the concert, why is there not a single rich or powerful black man (or even a Chinese or Arab or any other colored person)?High in gimmicks and using actors popular on television, the movie is a recipe for box office success: not surprisingly, such movies are usually also the most pathetic ones.
