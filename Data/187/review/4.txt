I won't write a spoiler, but merely invite viewers of the film to reflect on how what the prisoners and their legal counsel are striving to prove has any logical bearing on the issue of their guilt, given the method by which the crime was committed. My son pointed this problem out to me when he saw the film at the age of 12; I myself, like the many people who have found the plot to be credible, had not picked up on it. It's a classic instance of Hollywood-manufactured cognitive dissonance.Before the over-the-top stereotypical court scene at the end, the performances of the actors are very good.


                
The Troubles is a recurring subject in Irish/British film making and one can't say In The Name Of The Father is the pick of the bunch with regards to this matter. It even is a bit surprising that it receives such raving critics when the movie has such little impact on the viewer.The plot's introduction doesn't augur anything good and you wonder where Jim Sheridan wants to take you to. The script then shifts to a prison chronicle — which turns out to be the real nature of the film — that blatantly lacks intensity and most importantly rhythm, a lot of scenes being not that pertinent. It is also regrettable that the movie is sometimes caricatural, for example with the trial scenes which aren't that well depicted.What to draw then from this film ? not much, only the good performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and especially Pete Postlethwaite, already dazzling at the time, manage to save the day.
