 A good docu-drama but nothing more

 A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture

 Solid Film Lacking Dramatic Punch

 Lecture me

 All the Paedo-Priest's Men

 Pretty bland

 Felt very long and slow paced.

 Well assembled ensemble

 Exposure of Catholic Archdiocese misdeeds.

 Subtle and methodical. Great acting, but characters you do not care much about.

 I get how important it is and yet I have to wonder where the greatness is

 Just decent

 Goodbye Good Men

 A very good film that's been over-hyped, not awards worthy

 Not enough horsepower

 Very genuine but boring movie

 Solid movie

 Spot the Light Difference.

 A Courageous Film

 An interesting take on "crime drama"

 Wrong to insinuate that the Church has not reformed. One time watch. Not worthy of best film though.

 Covers a sensitive topic with dignity

 True story, important film - Child abuse in the Church

 It's written in the bible "Let the little children come to me" ... After seeing this movie that sounds really morbid.

 Riveting procedural hampered by an emotional distance
