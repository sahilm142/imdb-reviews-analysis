 The Descent of Jimmy McGill

 Works not only as a spin off.. but as a show in its own right!

 Don't compare with Breaking Bad

 S'all Good man!

 A good start, and just gets better and better

 A show beyond expectation.

 The world and everything in it.

 Don't compare this to Breaking Bad

 If there were more episodes, I'd given a 10!

 Thanks Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould!

 I like it more than breaking bad!

 For a series I never planned on watching, it has become one of the best I've ever seen.

 Bob Odenkirk at his best

 this show rides on it's retro look, calm direction and nostalgia

 Better Call Saul surprises early...

 Better Call Saul is one of the Better Spin-Off of a TV Series

 This is the dramatic methadone for coming off your "Breaking Bad" fix... one of the best prequels ever.

 Fantastic Character study!!

 Oh so Vince-Gilligan-esque!

 A gem, cut with care and attention to detail in all phases.

 Exceeds expectations, this show is awesome.

 A Great Start

 Outstanding television

 Another Tour De Force by Vince Gilligan

 Lawyers are people too
