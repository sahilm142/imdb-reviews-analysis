 Brilliant, another Pixar home run

 Pixar hits it out of the park, again

 Possibly the best Pixar film to date.

 Drag me to heaven

 Imaginative, fun and moving - as close to perfect as Pixar has ever been

 I felt like a completely new person, truly moving

 Up "uped" the bar once again! Wonderful movie

 Pixar launches their funniest film out of their tank to date.

 Pixar produces another Oscar Winner

 Up-lifting, Up-standing, Up-pealing, and quite simply - brilliant!

 Up: A roller-coaster of emotion and technical wizardry

 A delight...plus it's in 3-D!!

 Up is great!

 Pixar never fails!!

 UP-lifting

 as they say, Pixar hits it out of the park again!

 "Up" flies as high as the house which becomes the premise of the film.

 Up and away

 So Good You'd Think It Was Live Action

 UP Soars to New Heights!

 U FOOLS

 Absolutely wonderful!

 Pixar's gone crazy....

 My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display.

 Sad, yet worth it!
