 A bit slow n tedious but still one of the best western film. Fonda was terrific.

 Leone's film unfolds across the screen in time and space with all the mellowness and majesty of such great Westerns as "Shane," "The Searchers," and "The Magnificent Seven."

 "When you've killed Four, it's easy to make it five."

 Without a doubt, one of the best Westerns of all time

 Leone goes a new route with the same results.

 Leone and Morricone Do It Again

 Twice Removed

 The woman, the good, the nearly good and the bad.

 The operatic tale of greed, lust and revenge.
