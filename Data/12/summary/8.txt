 Forrest Gump

 Not my favorite but the Best I've watched so far

 Great movie

 The Good & The Bad Of Forrest Gump

 In the eyes of a 16 year old girl

 Goodness, just goodness

 Tearjerking

 Life is but a box of chocolate, you never know what you are going to get.

 "Momma said they was my magic shoes...momma said they'd take me anywhere"

 Forest Gump

 Oh boy! The year of 1994!

 Sweet, Tear-jerking and Memorable

 Is this a clever and witty exercise of our intellects; or, is it just about taking Will Stockdale from NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS to the Nth Degree of the 'Hillbilly Scale?

 The film is the story of a low IQ boy's life who does great works, not by reasoning, but mostly by chance or as a result of some events.

 A great movie... if you can overlook the historical whitewashing.

 A Film Everyone Should Watch.

 Touching film

 A sensitive story told

 the world will never be the same
