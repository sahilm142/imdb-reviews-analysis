 Disappointed

 The most overrated movie on IMDb right now, a complete letdown

 Poor in almost every possible way.

 Mediocre

 What The Hell Did I Just Watch!

 "Interstellar" Is Big-Budget Disaster

 Nolan misfires with mumbo jumbo

 Overrated. Total waste of idea.

 Detached drivel, just about watchable

 Wreck of a movie, hard to find anything good about it

 Wants too much. Achieves almost nothing.

 I'm still recovering

 Big disappointment. Not black hole but plenty of holes.

 An underwhelming experience for me

 The fine line between clever and dull and weird...

 One of the dumbest sci-fi films ever made

 disaster

 Ho Hum

 Overly Long With Little Real Purpose Or Meaning

 Interstellar's Less Than Stellar Performance

 Starts off well but goes rapidly downhill

 A once promising director assaults his audience with a seemingly never-ending barrage of bafflement

 Interesting and visually stunning...but I just couldn't get invested in the story.

 A Bit of a Disappointment

 Made no sense and slow pace
