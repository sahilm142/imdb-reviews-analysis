 What did we just see?

 A brilliant masterpiece from a masterful director

 Kurosawa's first milestone, one of the top foreign films of the 20th century

 A rare and a unique masterpiece from the master himself

 "I just don't understand this story"

 Nested, Folded, Parallel Narrative

 Who is more wrong?

 Dirty degradation away from mysticism

 Confusion and Hope

 Another Masterpiece by Akira Kurosawa Showing Different Perspectives of a Crime

 "It's human to lie"

 The Theme of the Picture....

 All of the praise is deserved.

 A masterpiece of Japanese cinema! A must-see!

 "It's Because Men Are Weak That They Lie."

 Distinctly Resonates As Akira Kurosawa's Finest Outing

 Greatness comes through the narrative by adding great perspective. Proved by Kurosawa

 Human beings are flawed, but not Film-making from Akira Kurosawa.

 A masterful piece of cinema

 A film yet more than a film...

 The quest for the truth and the human soul !!!

 Very Influential - My Favorite Foreign Film

 The film that introduced western audiences to Japanese cinema

 In a Grove where the Rashomon lies

 "Come on Homer, You Liked Rashomon." "That's not how I Remember It"
