I first saw The Prisoner when it was originally broadcast. I was about 6 at the time, and I remember telling myself, "OK...I don't "get" this because I'm a kid." I loved the Village, the clothes, and in a bizarre way, Rover. But I knew I didn't understand it. I did catch on to the basic messages of "man as just another number in society" and "Who are the bad guys? Are the "good guys" the bad guys? Who's in charge here, really?" Having with much older, social-activist siblings probably helped; but I must admit I watched it because they did. In 2004 I had the opportunity to see the series again, and I thought, "Now's my chance to see what this was really about." I watched it with my European husband. I still didn't "get" it, and neither did he. Oh, the anti-totalitarian message was still there...very much of its time and place...but it was just as bizarre and confusing as the first time. I never did figure out the significance of the penny-farthing bicycle that appears in sculpture, paintings and pins on people's clothing...but then I don't think you're supposed to. As for McGoohan's over-the-top acting...well, the less said about that, the better. Styles change with the decades, but even so...ugh. You don't *have* to be high to watch The Prisoner...but it probably helps.
