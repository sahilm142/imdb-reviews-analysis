 A Real masterpiece

 Bergman's ultimate best

 (review of the 5-hour cut) A total, un-abashed work of art that you'll love or hate. I loved it, and it's likely one of the great epics I'll ever see

 "...Anything can happen, anything is possible. Time and space do not exist..."

 Triumphant

 Not only one of the best Swedish films ever made , one of the best films ever made!!!

 Absolutely Awe-Inspiring

 An Ingmar Bergman Masterpiece. One of the Greatest Films Ever Made!

 Perhaps the Greatest Film Ever Made

 Simply Perfect Film-making

 A great Bergman film that is unique for the director.

 Without Any Rehearsal

 eternal

 The best movie ever made in its genre

 Best motion picture ever

 I have given the vote of a perfect 10 for the five hour version of this flawless masterpiece, not for the three-hour version.

 A true masterpiece of epic proportions with stunning cinematography and sumptuous set

 Shaped my visual vocabulary

 Starts Slow...Then, Takes Off

 A Masterpiece

 Family, Death, God.

 The best film ever made.

 Fanny and Alexander

 Maybe Bergman's greatest film, and that's saying a lot!
