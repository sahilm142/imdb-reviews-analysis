 One of the best things on TV at the moment

 Every Bit As Great as We Hoped

 One of the Best Shows of This Generation

 I love this show.

 Adventure Time: Inventive, Imaginative, Algebraic, Timeless

 Cartoons like this come once in a decade!

 It's perfect

 The greatest TV show on cartoon network

 Good bye, old friend!

 Adventure Time is often misunderstood

 ¡¡Amazing!!

 A Classic

 Smart enough for adults

 Adventure time is a very good show

 This is the best cartoon ever!

 Fabulous cartoon that effectively has no limits on its creativity.

 Incredible Show! By far the best I have seen in years on Cartoon Network!

 Adventure Time Should be President.

 Who Would Go To a Land of OOO Theme Park? I Would

 Awesome!!

 A Soon-To-Be Timeless Classic

 Stupid, but enjoyably stupid

 Not what you might be expecting (Unless you're expecting greatness)

 Adventure time is brilliant

 High re-watch value. From laughter to tears.
