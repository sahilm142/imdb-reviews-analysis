I am a gay man of the Stonewall Era. Yes, that was almost 50 years ago, my dears. I was familiar with the previous version of this show. So, I was astounded at the same thing all over again, with the exception of the subjects being from a more possibly homophobic demographic. Perhaps that was what the plug for "acceptance" meant in the promo. That really bugged me. I personally have never flitted around in a gang of girly men (queens, in the culture). However, I have respected and dated men who were not macho-male stereotypes by any means. This is what I find disappointing in this show. Once again, the showy fem hairdresser dominates and all the boys chime in. How much better it would be if the connection between straight men and gay men was a naturally respectful one without the camp. My disappointment is deepest in the Netflix producers who fostered this behavior for marketing. It is like using a gay version of minstrel show caricature to attract an audience. I do not mean that the cast don't have skills and talents at all. I simply regret that they have to be smothered in swish. It cries lack of self-respect.
