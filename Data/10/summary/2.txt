 "My life is unfulfilling, what should I do...?"

 Sophomoric

 Unadulterated pretentious trite (spoilers galore)

 This movie is garbage

 Bring back NC-17

 Irresponsible filmmaking

 Turn off after 30 minutes

 Don't watch it if you hate fighting!

 SLEEPER.

 Jon Monsarrat review: too arty, too violent, mindless & awful

 Hello??? Doesn't anyone care about coherency anymore???

 Nice twist.

 Starts Well, Ends Eventually...

 Incredibly overrated and makes little sense

 The anti-anti-corporate film

 ridiculous

 Sorry, I don't buy it. (spoiler, maybe)

 A good movie that doesnt work....

 A punch on the nose

 A dark, intriguing and haunting film about.... NOTHING!!!

 Negative

 Another Emperor's New Clothes

 Stomp This Film, Please
