 Bergman knows how to make you think.

 One last time around the strawberry patch.

 Thoughtful & Thought-Provoking

 A cold start to a warm ending.

 Cinema as an art form

 100% Bergman

 My brief review of the film

 "I have a habit of recalling scenes from childhood to calm me. So it was this evening."

 Too Cultivated

 An existential road movie through life

 Journey back to the childhood

 Wild Strawberries: One of Bergman's Best

 Emotionally disconnected

 Yet another Bergman classic that I liked and admired, but didn't love on first viewing

 Another beautifully painted contemplative portrait of mortality

 Bergman is the man

 Wild Strawberries

 Wild, wild strawberries..
