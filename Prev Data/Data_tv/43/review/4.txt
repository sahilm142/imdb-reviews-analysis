It was a superb comedy, in its original incarnation. By all means, watch the first three seasons. It's a shame they couldn't come close to capturing that same level of quality with the last two seasons. S5 in particular is almost painfully unfunny.


                
The original series was a 10 for me, while the new series, taken on by Netflix no less, has steeply declined to 0 for me. So an even 5 is all I can give for this once masterpiece of a show that's devolved to trash.


                
Considering the rate given by the users and the fact that it recently restarted, it seems obvious that I didn´t get this show. I found the cast and the synopsis interesting but after a couple of episodes, I noticed that I still hadn´t either smiled or laughed even once. One of those things I guess.


                
You would think that Ron Howard, the veteran of Happy Days and Andy Griffith Show, would get why I am not crazy about this show. Unlike Happy Days and the Andy Griffith Show, Arrested Development lacks warmth in it's main family. One of the many reasons people watch family oriented sitcoms is because they like the family. As much as I tried to like this show, I couldn't get pass the characters. Except for Jason Bateman, the show never really catches my attention. Jeffrey Tambor is always wonderful but he is not enough. I found this show to be confusing and often bewildering. I wanted to like this show and I tried but I never caught on like the critics. One of the many reasons that we watch the same sitcoms over and over is for the laughs and because we like the family or the cast of characters. I found this group to be unlikable and shallow and I am sorry that I am not a critic. But I think if you look at all the popular sitcoms in history, you will find that the characters who became endearing to its audience won both critics and fans. Just look at them again.
