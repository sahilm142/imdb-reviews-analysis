 Many characters in a strange situation

 You get what you deserver!

 Loc, Stock and Christ this is a good film!

 Witty, Interesting and Entertaining.

 Not as Good as Snatch but still great fun

 A Class Act.

 WITTY AND MORE

 New meaning to "black comedy"

 Cool romp through the London underside

 Good, not so clean, smoking fun

 Propably the coolest film of the decade

 Only the Smartest (or Dumbest) Survive!
