 Dear Hunter:

 Not without flaws but the most real portrayal of Vietnam I've seen

 "I feel a lot of distance... I feel far away."

 Superb war drama

 Great, But Missed Its Mark on Me

 Compelling study of the effects of war, excellent in parts but not incisive enough as a whole.

 Not the best film of 1978, but close

 Horrifyingly boring

 Long-winded Drama and very few war scenes

 Broken People
