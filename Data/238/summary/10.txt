 Absolutely fantastic. Easily the best film of the year.

 The only problem...

 How do you make a sequel to "Before Sunrise"? This is how.

 So Little Time, So Much Love.

 Wow! Satisfying at so many levels

 I'm designed to feel slightly dissatisfied!

 Pure Delight

 A great movie, and a nice break from most Hollywood trash.

 Just great

 Lovely romantic story

 A perfect sequel to Before Sunrise

 Linklater brings a tired genre to life

 'Baby, you are gonna miss that plane...I know'

 A magnificent follow up to a beautiful picture

 best movie ever

 what fascinates and interests almost works to annoy the viewer, but Linklater does come closest to Bergman here

 Beautiful in its simplicity

 the most honest and beautiful film i've ever seen

 best ending of all time

 A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Before Sunset (2004)

 Perfect sequel to my most favorite movie

 between hello and goodbyes..

 The sequel I never wanted to see has exceeded my expectations

 My words below will never do justice to this film

 Let's talk
