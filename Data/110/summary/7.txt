 better the second time 'round

 A good, old fashioned movie

 Hollywood Wasn`t Ready For It

 Above average, but not by much

 The Good & Bad Of L.A. Confidential

 Only Cromwell remains on top

 Interesting, well made, but wildly overrated.

 Silly, But Entertaining

 Great 'western style' shootout in a good detective thriller!

 Meh

 It's hip, It's cool... it's also totally boring

 Intelligent, intense, and brilliant

 Overrated!

 Good, thrilling and with action on many levels

 excellent story line.

 3/4 of the movie is brilliant, but 1/4 of it almost breaks the entire film

 Nice plot weaving that eventually became some kind of a classic

 Stylish 50's crime flick does everything right

 Decent, but not top 100

 Quite good

 Corruption in Los Angeles

 Contrived ending keeps L.A. Confidential from greatness

 Pay attention....
