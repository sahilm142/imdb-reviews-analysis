I think there was a lot of unrealistic expectations for a show that's replacing ER, but this is not the way to go here. First of all, the characters aren't relating to each other in a natural way at all. The speech given to the rookie cop from the more experienced one was, I'm sorry laughable and sounded like it was made for a movie in the 70's or a provocative after school special or something. I don't want to compare it to ER but I have to, because almost everyone else will, if you've been chosen to replace the pope, you better wear the hat if you know what I mean. The chemistry has to be there in the first place and then it builds up and branches out as the show grows, but you can't force it. With these kind of shows (cops, medical dramas...etc) we always see the same "been there, done that" situations, but the thing that makes it stand out from the others is how everyone will deal with them. We want to get into it and we want to relate to the characters and the only way to achieve that is by making them more emotionally accessible and socially acceptable to the viewers. I mean when we watch Superman we accept him as a superhero and a fictional character, but when people watch a show like that, they need to relate to it on a more realistic aspect, and the way it was done, I don't think it was happening. Needs a lot of work.
