 This review will contain more emotion than this poor excuse for a film

 Rowling's work has been abused severely...

 One of the Worst Films iv ever watched!

 Who Cares about Plot When You've Got Special Effects

 Boring, Ridiculous, Devoid of Tension

 OK film, terrible adaption

 3 words: Awful,Awful and Awful!

 it all ended with disappointments.

 Not good,very disappointing

 To all Harry Potter's fan, Do not watch this movie

 Why Harry Potter 7 part 2 isn't that good

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Fail Part 2

 Book is 100 times better

 Voldermort shakes his head. The most disappointing of the series! *Critics afraid to be honest!

 Loved the book, almost hated the movie

 Awful.

 Deathly Hallows part 2 is another headache inducing nightmare, thank god the Harry Potter film series is OVER!

 Not worth it as a movie

 Retarded

 Really Silly, So Disappointing That It Fails To Entertain The Audience

 Rowling is a death eater, supporter of Lord Voldemort by allowing Slytherin to remain active at Hogwarts.

 meh

 HEADLINE: Harry Potter claims to have defeated dark lord.

 Best Harry Potter movie by far, but has some flaws.
