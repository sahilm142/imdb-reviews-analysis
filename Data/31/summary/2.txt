 I hate this film.

 Overrated by far

 Horrific Piece Of Sentimental... I Don't Know

 1.5 hour movie stretched to 3 hours

 A movie is only as good what you put into it

 A movie about how black people can enrich the lives of whiteys (Spoilers!)

 Oh Stephen, WAKE UP!!!!

 Nice try, but NO.

 Rip-off

 if you liked 'The Shawshank Redemption', don't see this one

 So much wrong here

 Overrated by far

 I can't believe people liked it! = (

 A huge disappointment

 Overrated Tom Hanks whimsical nonsense.

 Terrible

 A big disappointment
