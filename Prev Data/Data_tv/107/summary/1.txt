 A cruel endurance test. Don't listen to the shills.

 Truly Awful 1/10

 Boringstar Galactica.

 It stunk!

 MST3K Fodder!

 Among the worst remakes of all time!

 Battlestar Ga-WRECK-tica

 WHAT A "REINVENTION"!!

 what were they thinking

 The writers bit off more than they could chew.

 Snore, Churn, Groan. When will it end?

 And things go from bad to worse.

 Nope, It Ain't.

 Should not have been named Battlestar Galactica

 Trendy Shaky Camera

 Typical TV Crap- A Non-Event

 Battlestar Gallactica - unoriginal

 More Jean-Luc Picard Syndrome

 worst remake ever seen

 Please, someone tell me- does it get better?

 I'm a Sci Fi fan, but I couldn't stomach this BSG.

 Remakes Never Succeed!

 It's not the real thing!
