 Season 2 review

 Intriguing and intense

 Frustration dot com

 Very interesting documentary

 Brilliant

 Good documentary, biased but really hiding clear evidence against Steven?

 Great documentary, Does Not Need to be 10 Episodes Long Though

 infuriating for all the right reasons

 He's innocent all right

 I would've given it a 10/10 but...
