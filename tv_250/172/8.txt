I have read Evelyn Waugh's Decline and Fall when a high-school student and I found the book interesting regarding the reversals of fortune of the central character, I think Paul Pennyfeather. I have never read Brideshead Revisited except the first few chapters. Some weeks ago there was Jeremy Irons on ET1, the Greek national TV and his voice narrating. Having heard about the series before I assumed that this must have been Brideshead Revisited, which it was.I followed the series and read a sizeable proportion of the novel, sometimes holding it while the TV was playing the series. I realized that they followed the book very closely, which I found pleasant.Due to holiday I missed the part of the series after Julia narrates to Ryder her marriage to Rex Mortram, coming back just to see the last two episodes. From what I saw and read I found Brideshead Revisited an admirable production with a very impressive cast and splendid recreation of the novel's locale, especially Brideshead and Venice. Today I just bought the four disc collection of Brideshead which included a booklet which had a picture of Brideshead in its interior page. This picture reminded me a glimpse I had of Brideshead in a tour in Oxford. My viewing of the series is highly personalized interspersed with personal reminiscences. I think the value of great art is that it allows us to conceive it in a personalized manner and to form a personal relationship with it. My subjective experience of this series has been very positive although fragmentary and I warmly recommend it as a spectacle and work of art.
