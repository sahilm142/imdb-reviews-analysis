Oh my God! What laughable writing and dialog!! Its like of a spoof of itself. The story is OK, but is totally ruined by the writing and over-the-top acting. From start to end, its nothing but silly, catchy phrases you'd expect in a spoof on 40's detective movies. The required IQ for understanding the dialog is 40 or more, so do not be worried about following things. I was also unimpressed with the lighting. Simply filing a scene in insufficient lighting does not truly add drama and interest. Overall, this film is very unbelievable, laughable, and inane. Thankfully, MacMurray's career wasn't ruined by this horribly stupid film.
