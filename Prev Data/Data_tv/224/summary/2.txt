 Crazy, immensely entertaining conspiracy thriller with a unique look, pitch-black humour and an amazing soundtrack

 Bold, Brilliant, Original and yet strangely familiar

 See it, but ask no-one about it, don't even read the reviews,

 Gem of a show

 Great show with a brilliant futuristic message

 Visually stunning

 Devastatingly Sublime

 Best thing since Lost

 Spectacular if weirdly realistic vision of the future

 I've never watched anything this intense and I have watched over 2 Terabytes of movies/television.

 The best show ever made.

 One of the best

 Gorgeous

 Nerve jangling, disturbing and thoroughly thought provoking

 Utopia - One of the best television series currently on the air

 Dark & Brutal. Love It!

 Utopia

 Fantastic, enjoyable, politically, smart, brutal, at times funny

 Quite honestly one of THE best shows I have ever seen!

 Great new TV Drama series, looking forward to season 2!

 One of the best TV shows I've ever seen

 When shock value works .. and when it doesn't

 Wonderful television

 Where we get a look into the apocalyptic abyss - for the better or worse.

 The best TV show you've probably never heard of!
