 And the Emmy go to...

 It was great at the beginning... Then it was confusing. Then it's just bad.

 I feel dirty after liking this guy.

 Started strong but flailed

 Interesting, but goes downhill after the fourth season

 Great premise, but...

 Brilliant most of the way through

 Alittle too hyped, but still good.

 Loved the concept and the whole series except for the last episode!

 Brilliant show but a somehwat disappointing finish!

 "Bail out!!! Jump ship while you can!"

 Intriguing concept

 Went on too long

 All the workings of a great show, but a HIGHLY disappointing ending.

 9/10 for the first 5 seasons, 1/10 for the rest.

 Could have been amazing

 first two seasons were great next two seasons mediocre next two seasons going downhill and then its crap

 Remember the Monsters?

 Fun watch

 Exciting and boring

 could have been better

 Kind of great but some Incoherency and nonsense

 Leaves other crime dramas trailing, simply brilliant

 No no no no

 A really good series....
