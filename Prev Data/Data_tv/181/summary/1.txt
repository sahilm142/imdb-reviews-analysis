 From really good to really stupid

 Heavy-handed, laughable, derivative crap

 Strong start, sloppy end

 Horrible and, before anything else, scary.

 Season 2...what a waste

 Garbage

 From a one to a fat zero

 Total disappointment

 A dumbed-down comic book created by marketers

 disgusting emptiness

 I was looking for a good TV series and sadly this is definitely NOT it!

 Boring

 Lost it right away after episode 1

 You're not fooling me.

 Season Two: You're losing it.

 Not worth it!

 Not exactly enjoying it. Depressing writing doesn't equal good writing.

 Another lame attempt to portray science and technology in a lame and stupefying manner

 Great start but went to trash

 Full cliché

 Yoyoyoyoyoyo wha...?

 What in the hell did I just waste ten hours of my life on...

 A huge promise that ended up like a big disappointment

 Combine all the ingredients in a blender and mix.

 Season 2 is not worth watching unless you're partial to schizoid embolisms
