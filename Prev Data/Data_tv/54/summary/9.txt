 A Spectacular Philosophical/Sci-Fi TV Show

 A beautifully layered story on the dawn of AI

 Season 1 of "Westworld" was fantastic.

 Binge worthy

 An Interesting Look at What It Means to Be Real

 Disappointing in terms of the potential to execution ratio

 Is this the start of a new era for TV shows?

 Season 2 tried too hard

 Westworld - at the start (ORIGINAL FILM SPOILERS)

 Breathtakingly good and hooked!

 Off to a good start

 This rating and review is for season one

 Not the old Westworld at all.

 Engrossing and thoughtful. Very promising so far.

 Thought provoking

 perfect show but, does it need another season?

 Smart and logical writing

 Good premier; plot moves quickly early on

 1st episode and hooked

 Whispers of Blade Runner and Jurassic park in a Western setting....

 Wait a second..

 One of the best

 Amazing

 Maeve went off script

 The Original
