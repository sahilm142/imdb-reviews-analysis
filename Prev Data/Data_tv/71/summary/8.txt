 Very good sitcom

 Hilarious Comedy - Just 1 Major Gripe.

 Totally outrageous

 Seinfeld Unchained

 Why We Watch Curb

 Brilliant and awful at the same time

 More Cohesive than Seinfeld

 Seinfield is not in the same league

 Totally different to Seinfeld

 Would love to rate higher than 8, but...

 Great show
