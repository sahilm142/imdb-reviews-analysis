 I just can't believe there is a anime as interesting and amazing as this...

 Starts of alright..but afterwards it becomes amazing...this anime is a must see !!!

 Long Form storytelling at its finest

 Message for the heart and humanity

 A great anime!

 My second fav anime after one piece.

 Great series, but too many flash backs.

 Probably what you expected in a Ninja world.
