 A simple classic and a must see by every Eastwood fan

 The Blood of Human Kindness

 Never seen so many men, wasted so badly

 More good and beautiful than bad and ugly...but some of all four!

 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

 Prefer OUTIW

 Well done

 One of the best !

 The best of Eastwood's "spaghetti westerns"

 This is what a western should be like

 A Classic Western Movie With an Unforgettable Soundtrack

 Arguably the best spaghetti western of all time

 Not as good as A few Dollars More

 The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Review

 Harks back to the days when Westerns were super-popular!

 A very good western but overlong

 Impressive western, masterful music

 The old, gritty West and life in general

 Best of the trilogy, Leone at his best

 There is a fortune in gold to be found.

 Great classic!
