 Finding an Apple in a bag full of Oranges..!

 A short & sweet, awesome treat!

 Great show

 Setting the tone for the future!

 A wonderfully written, directed and acted, unique rom-com that pleases immensely.

 Amazing ...Simply amazing

 Every episode is intelligent and filled with laughs - Do not watch sitting in your office!

 Neither do they die nor do they live happily ever after...It's a third kind of love story.
