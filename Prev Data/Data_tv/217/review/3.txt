Like Peaky Blinders before it Taboo was very much a case of style over substance.Poor story-line and obscure plot, steam punk costumes and an overall miasma of boredom. Is this really the best that the BBC can come up with? I have to admit that I persevered to the very end and now have to ask myself why when I could have spent the time in a more fulfilling manner.


                
A 9.3 rating? Have we seen the same show? Taboo must one of the worst shows ever produced. A very confusing plot, if any can be found, and absolutely awful over-acting, especially from Mr Hardy. That would be expected, though, since he's managed to ruin every film he's ever been in. Surely the worst actor of our time.The script makes no sense, the constant mumbling requires subtitles – and even then, it's more or less incomprehensible gibberish most of the time. Also, the language used is very much out of sync with the portrayed period. And Tom Hardy's hat looks like something stolen from a clown.If this is the future of drama on the BBC, I'm out.


                
I have a hard time understanding how this show justifies it's current rating of 8.5 on IMDB. The story is okay, but boring. If episode four isn't any better I'm giving up. Tom Hardy fans face reality and give this show the rating it deserves, a 5 at best.
