 Tension, tension, tension!

 Intense

 Sure to be one of the best films of the year

 A dynamic movie full of tensions and twists

 A pair of outstanding performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons embody Damien Chazelle's piece of perfection...

 Fantastic

 Are we supposed to like the sadistic, abusive teacher?

 Jazz is not pretty

 This is one compelling drama about the relentless pursuit of perfection. You can't beat that!

 Thankyou so much for the movie -Damien Chazelle

 It is an intense, powerful, and electrifying work of art

 Masterpiece that holds a truth seldom presented in films

 Mind-Blowing Jazz Music Harmonising with Some of the Most Amazing Acting

 A stunning character study that acts as a white knuckle thriller

 Good job

 thrilling rhythm

 Sound, rapturous, addictive.

 "70 Years As A Lamb Or 30 Years As A Lion?"

 Edge of your seat intensity

 Quite my tempo :D

 A strong story, very well acted

 Icarus with melting wings

 For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune. You were, Erickson, but he didn't know and that's bad enough.

 You are either the best or you are not to be remembered at all and that's the whole point of this miserable life.
