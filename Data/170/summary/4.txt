 I just don't get it.

 Waste of time unless you are an American.

 The Big Dud

 How on earth is this funny?

 just did not care...

 Although good comedic moments throughout, also slow and disjointed

 I couldn't be one of the fans of it

 IT SUCKED

 Easily the lowest common denominator of Coen films

 Emperor's New Clothes

 Over-rated

 Watch if you must...

 I'd heard big things about this movie.

 Love the Coens But Didn't Get This One

 It's a comedy, isn't it?

 Kept waiting
