I'm sorry, but i can't see the appeal here. I watched 3 episodes in agony, and i still haven't seen anything that a "normal" mind would find even remotely funny. The characters are stupid, abrasive and cruel, while Archer is an opinionated loudmouth who cares only about himself and isn't aware of what is happening around him most of the time.Someone on the discussion board said, that Archer is better than "Rick and Morty". How these two shows even begin to be on the same level of hilariousness is totally beyond me.I'm sorry, but i think Archer is garbage.But hey, just my 2 cents. If you like it, watch it!
