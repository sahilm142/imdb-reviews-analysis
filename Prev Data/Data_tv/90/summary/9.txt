 Brilliant, stylish, clever entertainment with witty script...

 Beautiful tale just before the world went to hell

 The difference between cliché and classic is in details...

 A wonderful series that should never be taken at face value.

 Guilty Pleasure!

 Begins in 1912 as the Titanic is sinking.
