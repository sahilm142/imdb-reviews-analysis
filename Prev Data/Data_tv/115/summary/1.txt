 Advertisers Love This Show, Hence All The Awards

 Yet Another Hyped-Up Snoozefest

 Boring and Jon Hamm is Terrible

 Lots of Hype for what really is a Bad Show

 Another Over-hyped, Bad, Boring Show

 Possibly the most overrated show of all-time.

 Either you will love it or (less likely) you will hate it.

 If the Goal of Great TV Writing is to Put You to Sleep, then Mission Accomplished!

 Overrated, snore fest, Soap Opera for unintelligent minds.

 Popular because it's popular

 This show is terrible

 The worst series made in the human history

 I didn't want to watch it to begin with

 Mad Med Allergy
