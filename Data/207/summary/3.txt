 Poor remake!

 Don't believe the hype

 2 hours of getting chased with nothing that amazes

 Dumb, dumb and dumber.

 Absolute garbage. Another franchise in the crapper.

 No script, no movie...

 I said I would not go and see anymore remakes. I should have kept that promise.

 Could be a better movie yet turning into Hollywood cliché. shame.

 Theatrical wasteland of ideas

 Noise, Noise and More Noise

 Has everyone gone mad? This movie is windows vista bad

 What's wrong with you people? This is lame at best

 Another example whats wrong in this industry

 Painfully bad

 One page script made someone 358 million dollars. I congratulate that producer and ask the viewers once again are you serious?

 Empty film, neither Max... nothing but violence and effects

 A mad max film for the focus groups

 OK, Mad Max was awesome... but the 1979 film

 Utter Tripe

 I cannot believe how high a score this movie has at IMDb.

 Would be better as a 10 minute short.

 Was that a movie?

 How to create an awful movie from a good story with a great cast

 Hyped to the limit

 Sound and fury signifying nothing
