For starters, IMDB should have separate these into seasons. First deserved 10, second 2, and third barely 4 stars. I've reviewed first two so let's say something about this, third one. Some mild spoilers but no big deal.
There's been some kind of trend going on for TV-shows in past few months: all talk, nothing happens. This one is truly in line with that. I've noticed that in Punisher, Star Trek Discovery and now here. Everybody is just leading endless idle conversations about nothing with nothing really happening. This season of TD really deserves TD. The whole season, all eight episodes could fit into an average yawning 100 minute movie. If it wasn't for a brief Rambo episode with "the revenge of the war veteran (Mr. Woodard) molested by idiots" , it would be completely empty. It's hard to comprehend this. Excellent actors and performances of nothing. All idling. Talks, thoughts, more talks, slow pace, them slower pace and some talks and thoughts. In slow pace. After this third season it becomes obvious that the creator and author is colossally overrated. This is not story telling, this is graphomania. Please, don't waste everybody's time and/or money and/or talent on more filming such stuff for television. Go find something else to play with. OR, rename the show to Conversations and Thoughts. This one has nothing to do with a detective. Or true.


                
Series 1 and 2 were good crime dramas. Series 3 feels we need love affairs with the black actors.I for one have no idea how this series is getting the reviews it is.actors are one dimensional and the slow build up of a love affair is a sleep fest. I won't bother looking out for series 4.


                
We waded through 7 episodes of Mahershala Ali mumbling and fighting with his wife - following all kinds of red herrings and misdirections, too many characters, and it just ended with a fizzle with episode 8. I'm glad the girl was okay, but it was just too much trouble to get there. Good acting (especially Stephen Dorff), moody atmosphere, etc, but the end didn't justify the means. Not sure I will bother with the series if it returns.
OMG. Season 3 is just mumbling, oddness. ***SPOILER ALERT*** In episode 4, the part where the detective is old and having a breakdown involving Vietnam war hallucinations??? I LITERALLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD OF THAT ENTIRE SCENE!!! This series is steadily going down hill. The acting is better in season 3 than in season 2. But the story line and writing is so bad, it's gobstopping. I feel badly for the actors starring in it. Because they are actually the ONLY reason why I am giving this 4 stars.
1st season was excellent, 2nd was OK but the 3rd season is unwatchable. Slow, boring and confusing with continuous flash backs. Could end in 3 episodes at most. You have to suffer 6 episodes of unconnected mambo jumbo in order to watch in the final 2 episodes the connection between the various pieces. Total disappointment.


                
How do you judge a series which starts brilliantly, cooks up great theories and possibilities, but in the end shows up many plot holes and ends tamely? Should we hail it as brilliant, just because the two leads give wonderful performances?Can it be termed as an art because of the many brooding, grim, dark camera shots?True Detective is a puzzle in itself.If the writer wanted it to be a character study of it's leads, then it should have been just that.It shouldn't have put emphasis on a great crime and an even greater conspiracy.Cause all through the seven episodes it does that and in the last fifteen minutes of the eight, completely shifts itself to being about Marty Hart and Rust Cohle.No satisfying explanations are given about the crimes, about the cult, about the murders.Mind you all the while (esp in the last few episodes) the detectives conveniently stumble on answers.And we are left with a fairly standard deranged, inbred villain.This first season had so much potential, but doesn't fulfill it.It is even sadder, that it has achieved some sort of a cult status.There are many series better and smarter than this.


                
I am sure it would be good if I could understand one word of what Ali says..in whatever age he is playing the character!


                
Loved the first, second was terrible, third I cannot stay awake. It's just a lot of hoarse mumbling in southern accents. The story just doesn't not progress. Several times I've had to start an episode again just to figure out what's going on. The pressure to make a season as good as the first is really getting to the writers and producers. All stars are for the first season.


                
Series wanders more each year it drags on, Acting is great. Cinematography is great. Very realistic, Story is kinda, eh?? Supposedly hard-boiled, Viet-Nam vet detectives are haunted by case for 30-40 years?Series has jumped the shark.


                
Each succeeding season of this True Detective has degraded from the first one, this season being no different. The story became very labor intensive to the point of not being enjoyable to watch due to the jumping from past, not too distant past and present. I thought the acting was the only strong part of the series. Yet, the central mystery was of what happened to Julie was very plodding and could not have carried the audience in the conventional linear fashion of a mystery which is why, I believe it was written in this fashion. The last epsiode I thought was well done, in that it left it open to the viewer to determine whether Julie had been found.
If you have an interesting detective story then get on with the story. We know that both leads are talented actors so why the long tortured monologues? Stereotyping women as accessories in this series was big mistake. This is cable. Be bold. Do something different. Put women in interesting roles or don't bother using them at all. This season relied on teasing the the audience with clues and it dragged on for too many episodes. Because of the sex scenes and personal turmoil of the two leads, I lot track of the clues and minor characters. When that happens, you lose the audiences and you lose the mystery & suspense. The relationship between the leads is interesting. It would be better if McConaughey didn't chew up the scenery so much. Harrelson is doing fine but I feel bad for him because the director & the writers are showcasing his co-star. Harrelson is one of the most underrated actors in the business. He has a wider range of talent and he avoids overacting. It's called discipline. True Detective looks more like a McConaughey vehicle and that's not what I wanted from this series. His long monologues are boring. It's the story - not an acting tutorial.
Season 1 - Fantastic
Season 2 - gave up
Season 3 - terrible (please don't bother)


                
Just finished watching it all, one episode after another, in a row, with some occasional sleeping and eating. Now, these days one rarely has a privilege to watch something perfect but this is it. What's perfect about it? Everything. Writing, direction, acting (truly a work of art here), casting, music, editing, cinematography (especially choice of colors), even the duration. You name it. Oh, yes: it is dark. And slow. But it is just as it should be. Such a story so perfectly told you cannot put into a regular movie (or even a two part movie). It had to be a tailored set of episodes for the TV. I'm glad there are people out there who are true artists and not afraid to show it. Extremely recommended. Keep the recording of all episodes someplace and watch it again after a while. It is still hard to believe that this was "only a job" for all the people involved in the production. Bravo!


                
Half of the dialogues is just f*** and s***, but in fact it is the only credible half. The rest is a nonsensical sort of dialogue where they say nothing but in a very pompous way. Plot rather confused but mainly confusing, and I am afraid that this is the aim. It's all and only atmosphere (it often works, fortunately), good acting but too acted (director's fault).


                
i was caught by the hype and made my self sit through 3 episodes till i just broke. its is some kind of "The Killing" style thriller/drama with a very similar score by the way, trying to look very intelligent but actually succeeds to be slow and pointless. in this time and age when there are so many good shows: Breaking Bad, Justified, to name few it is beyond me how this rating and hype ever happened. its not complicated and deep its just damn boring. don't get me wrong, the acting and the technical side is just superb and matthew mcconaughey & woody harrelson deserve every bit of praise they get, DP is great editing etc. but the one thing that makes a movie or a show pop out is the story and theme, and this plays out just so full of self importance its actually pretty shallow,i know the fans will bash me like hell but its the plain truth guys.


                
Everything about this new series is very interesting. However, the presence of one Matthew McConaughey nearly destroys it. Anyone who was ever born in or raised in the South will understand just what a terrible actor he is. While I am trying to enjoy this rather retro-styled, untamed crime drama is promising, the presence of this actor in my view nearly destroys the show entirely. That is has received such a high IMDb rating is not surprising, but it does seem worrisome that so many people can watch a "performance" by Matthew McConaughey and actually say they have enjoyed it. I find it agony. He tries to play a clever, "intellectual" detective, but it comes off as plastic, posed and artificial. His little stylistic antics, like the way he smokes a cigarette like it is a joint, are almost painful in their artless adoption. We also find out that he, along with Woody Harrelson are executive producers, and this explains in part why Matthew McConaughey is especially terrible in this part. Under a strong director, many of his more offensive and artless efforts can be channeled, but as a boss, we see him granting himself a license to be "innovative", and these efforts in fact approach nausea. While the story of two small town southern detectives investigating a gruesome murder is well written, and the supporting cast is sterling, Matthew McConaughey spoils it for me. He is perhaps one of the most over-rated actors in my lifetime.


                
Mahershala Ali spoke his lines so poorly that his speech was inaudible! He ruined this movie for our movie club. We all agreed that he was terrible.


                
Season 3Starts off as a detective story.Eventually all the episodes are fillers.
Show, so long, u even see the main actors get old and age..
Now that is slow .It would great a good movie around 2,15 minutes. It should be,
but the plot in itself aint a big a mystery. Its just they way it layed out, it gives many possebillities. So its not like, its more like, whatever that happened. But when u wait 7 episodes for something. It becomes a wow, finaly. God damn, no stop it . Finish this is, quick please... Its really the best try i gave to desribe this...If u dont have patience, this will train it for you, help u get more patience in life. Not always the easiest.
