 Not for lack of trying.

 A highly promising start to the depiction of life under the "Christian State of America"

 Strong acting but...

 Cautionary tales are written for a reason.

 I like it, but ...

 Emotionally disturbing television

 The gender politics are starting to creep in.

 Worth watching

 The Edible Woman

 Dont end like Walking Dead

 Season 2: the Handmaid's flashbacks

 Bright idea, suboptimal execution

 What the West would look like if Christianity resembled Islam

 Almost

 Gilead's Tale

 Poignant, maddening and innovative

 Conservative in favor

 scary dangerously current

 Deliberation about the nature of this series' story.

 Fantastic!

 Haunting show

 Good with some bad , overall enjoyable

 Captivating yet Weirded out

 Stunning and Thought Provoking

 Could have easily be a 10-star show except for one major problem
