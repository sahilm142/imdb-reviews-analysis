I'll put my Monty Python fan resume against anyone. I started watching "Flying Circus" in the '70s when it first aired in the US on PBS. I've seen all of their movies and concert videos. I have all of their albums. I've read most of their books. I've seen John Cleese live. Being a fan doesn't mean that you are blind. There was a reason that they had a hard time finding investors for this movie. It's not funny. There are maybe six laughs in the whole movie. Most of it is annoyingly unfunny.
