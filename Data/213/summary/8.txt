 Great Flick

 Logan is another level

 "Not with a bang, but a whimper."

 Solid and entertaining effort, better then the rest of the Wolverine stand alone's.

 Very nice action-drama movie

 A worthy, respectable finale to a storied franchise

 This Movie Stands on its Own

 A darker superhero story that pays off.

 Wolverine Does Leon (The Professional) Surprisingly Well

 If this is a Western, Logan is very reminiscent of broken-down antiheroes!

 I would give it a B-

 Needed more details but still solid , very entertaining and enjoyable

 another triumph of comic material's R-rated transmutation on the big screen

 Concluding & Acerbic Contemplation For Marvel Comics' Fictional Superhero

 The beginning of the end times

 A beautiful send off to the character

 A great movie to end a legacy.....

 Over all pretty good of a movie!!!

 Logan is really the most haunting superhero film since The Dark Knight.

 Mutants, Reluctant Heroism, and Genetic Patents

 A Gritty, Heartfelt Send-Off for a Legendary Character

 Logan

 The Legacy of A Legend

 Logan, best Wolverine movie as thus far.

 Great fun to watch
