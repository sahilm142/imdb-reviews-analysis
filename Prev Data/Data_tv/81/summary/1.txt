 Ugh...

 Compared to Breaking Bad its like watching grass grow

 Better call Saul...if you want to be BORED!

 Get ON with the story you pretentious morons

 Dead show

 This Show is AWFUL .. BORING .. TV Viewers are Desperate

 Please tell me how the f#&k this series is 9.3

 Bob Odenkirk is in way over his head, and only Jonathan Banks' portrayal as "Mike" relieves the tedium in this DOA prequel

 It's official, Vince, your show is B O R I N G ! ! !

 Season 4 and Saul needs to move it

 Screenplay Fail

 So boring. It is so slow it makes a snail look like Usain Bolt.

 pretty stupid just keeps getting worse

 Second season is worse than lunchbag letdown from the first

 Painfully boring.

 Crossing the Line

 Started off well but faded away. Very slow and boring

 Season 4

 Please sir, give me more scenes filmed in the dark!
