 What a masterpiece

 Can't get enough!

 Dark and disturbing and brilliant

 Ohhhh... I really like this show.

 Flawless, Deep and Historically Perfect

 the sound track was fabulous and boosted the show big time

 Best medical series ever made!

 Excellent, original and so engaging as interesting

 Doesn't get better than this! Brilliant!

 Best soundtrack ever!

 Best show currently on TV!

 Best show on TV

 Phenomenal

 Best Historic Medical Show

 Technically fascinating, narratively underwhelming

 Medically accurate and highly entertaining!! What can't Soderbergh do?!

 It's the best series out there!! You must watch it.

 The rough and tumble hospital rumble of American medicine in early 20th century

 Finally Clive Owen gets a role worthy of his talents!

 Based on true events!

 Why do all the great shows get canceled?

 A gritty masterpiece depicting the turn of the century

 One of my favorite shows of all time

 One of the best shows on air . Trust me
