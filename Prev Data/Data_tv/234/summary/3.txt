 It's about time!

 One of the funniest shows around

 easily my favorite 'variety' show of the 1970s; so many memories, laughs, songs, and strange creatures and friends

 This show is not only BRILLIANT, it's GENIUS!

 Good Show!

 Love the Muppets!

 I grew up with this show

 Brings back great and nostalgic memories

 The epitome of my childhood... how I miss it

 Strange relationship with the movies

 A legendary show

 Jim Henson's FInest Television Creation!

 One of the best shows and memories from my childhood it still stayed with me!

 Classic Pop Culture TV Show. Even Better Watching it Now an an Adult

 An absolute classic

 The best characters ever.

 Thank You, Jim Henson
