 Poor editing and script led to one of the most tiresome films i've seen in years.

 Spoilers Included - Horrible, a major disappointment. This movie is riddled with plot holes like Swiss cheese!!!

 Boring and aggressive pile of ...

 Not really that good of a movie.

 What's all the fuss about?

 slow, depressing, plot hole ridden nonsense

 completely empty

 Movie review

 Ridiculous - "Oh man, the kids crossed the border, there's nothing we can do, they won"

 Highly overrated

 Realistic take on , really though? Nah.,

 Not a worthy X-Men/Wolverine ending but a vulgar display of brutality

 The most depressing super hero movie ever made

 This is not a Marvel film, this is not a superhero film<U+0085>this is a SOAP OPERA!

 Overall poor final film.

 Depressing Disappointing Movie

 a HUGE disappointment... unfortunately

 Has a lot of good and a lot of bad. Mostly bad, though

 an unnecessary movie

 Poor

 If it's not a superhero movie then don't put superheroes in it

 O hell no

 Schindler's list was upbeat compared this this

 Another example of where the writer/director are out of touch with the audience

 Utterly depressing
