Need I say that after watching Samurai X Trust and Betrayal I was compelled to buy the series. It's completely the opposite of Trust and Betrayal and when it tries to get serious it's only ever cliché and generic. There's nothing I hate more than extensive talking during what's supposed to be a fight scene! (or an epic battle) And that's the formula for almost every single fight scene.Antagonist: Check out my technique. It's invincible, I'll destroy you etc..People on the sideline: He's using the (insert technique name) that can only be countered by (random crap) Oh noes, Kenshin will be slaughtered.Protagonist: I can't kill people. But I'll defeat you, despite your invincible technique/my injuries etc...(Insert more conversation, with a dash of action to break up the fighting conversation) Yes, it truly is a pitiful formula. The most obvious form of fillers.Pacifism is OK, but doesn't seem to work well for 95 episodes. As far as characters go. Kenshin and the police chap are quite solid characters. As for the others, there's no need for me to speak of them. They seem "cartoony." The type of character's you would expect in a show aimed at children? I liked at least 10% of the series nonetheless (I enjoyed the "screwing around" episodes more than the "epic battle" episodes to say the least). But the 90% I disliked was a waste of good money. As far as I understand it, the only reason this show could have as high a rating as it does is because of the sentimental bond that was formed with Kenshin's character in the previous renditions. I would definitely recommend Samurai Champloo over this if you want a good, solid samurai anime. In fact, I would recommend most other anime over this. Fullmetal Alchemsit, Mushishi, Trigun, Fruits Basket, Desert Punk, Licensed by Royalty, Gankutsuou, Cowboy Bebop to name a few. The list goes ever on and on.Share the Love, Azza
