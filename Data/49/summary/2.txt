 An insult to the intelligence (Possible Spoilers)

 Ruining the Good Name of the Mystery...

 Ludicrous

 Not worth the trouble

 Ughuk

 Style Over Substance

 Just BAD!

 A confusing mess

 Predictable and tedious

 Confusing, idiotic, and pointless.

 Oh what a tangled web...

 Mostly disappointing......

 Run from the hype. Really. Run.

 If You want pain in your back & neck then this is the movie for you

 Long, boring, and stupid

 Cast wasted... It's remarkably uninteresting

 Actually I didn't like it much at all

 Suspend disbelief my ass!!!!!!!!

 I felt conned...

 A promising film becomes an infuriating waste of time (contains spoilers)

 Read the novel instead

 Disappointing

 an insult to the intellect

 the prestige has no prestige

 Everything about this movie was poor
