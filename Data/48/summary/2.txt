 Overrated

 Pointless gorefest

 A shamelessly bad film *SPOILERS*

 A movie for the more philistine viewer

 A Ridley Scott Film.

 terrible, really terrible

 I hate it even more

 A Bad Reworking of Fall of the Roman Empire

 Why does everyone like this movie?

 What's the big deal?

 Looks great! Is dumb!

 Can't believe it won so many Oscars

 Glad it's over

 Something, something, but not very good.

 Phony

 What a bad script!!!

 A very expensive, very stupid, very unrealistic waste of time

 Boring

 Dear Ridley, what have you done......

 Boring and Over rated

 Over-rated schlock

 The three good points of "Gladiator"

 boys' film / bad computer graphics - what a disappointment

 Sword and sandal epic revived, as boring as ever

 Maybe it will be better on the small screen
