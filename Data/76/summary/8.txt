 Smoke and mirrors, without apologies

 "That wasn't very sporting, using real bullets."

 Alfred Hitchcock top-notch thriller/comedy embroils a a business man in killing and espionage

 Great script and Hitchcock's genius direction makes this film interesting even today

 More Hits than Misses

 One of Hitch's better flicks

 Don't Miss the Bus

 remarkably fresh, incredibly intense, ends a bit too fast

 One of the Coolest thriller

 Certainly worth watching.

 One of Hitchcock's best

 This thought has crossed our minds

 Entertaining old film

 Excellent Hitchcock wrong man spy adventure

 Hitchcock's risky and briskly adventure is the apt catalyst to this complex espionage thriller
