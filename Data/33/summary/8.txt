 Hithcock masterpiece in his most accomplished and perfect movie

 A horror classic

 i had to comment again

 Horror classic that lives up to its reputation.

 WOW I'm impressed

 Interesting and Scary

 It's pretty much the scariest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot

 Classic

 A major classic!

 OG horror

 Very good...but not Hitchcock's masterpiece

 A revolutionary movie but posses flaws.

 All Thanks to Alfred Hitchcock's The Original Psycho (the 1 with Janet Leigh as Marion Crane not Anne Heche)

 Brilliantly Scripted

 We all go a little mad sometimes...

 Where it all began!

 Iconic and masterfully executed, though thematically slight

 A psychological thriller

 The master of suspense turns in one of his greatest efforts.

 Greatest movie with a 10 minute scene about cleaning a bathroom

 Great film

 One of the greatest horror movies

 Classic horror film

 Classic Hitchcock Horror

 one of the best "code era" thrillers
