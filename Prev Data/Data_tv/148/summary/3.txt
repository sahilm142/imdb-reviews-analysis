 Most powerful animation I've ever seen

 Definition of Entertainment

 The greatest anime experience of all time....

 Awesome. That is to say, it leaves one in awe.

 The absolute Best Anime I have seen to date!!

 Very good

 Bloody anime, with a complex plot, I want more

 Berserk is a true classic anime

 Very crude, but very watchable

 Medieval kingdoms, big swords, frenzied warriors, gore, nude, sex, intrigue, betrayal, demons, a quest for vengeance, and an ending that was screaming for a sequel

 Best anime out there.

 My personal favorite anime of all time. Rivals the best movies and TV shows as well.

 Berserk is a masterpiece

 Pure Art

 In-F'ing-credible Story, rough ending though.

 The Story Of A Life Time.
