 Very charming film... please be patient with it!

 soulful drama of an idealized romance ..

 There's nothing to it, yet there is so much

 One of the best romance movies I've seen so far

 opposites attract

 Simple romance executed perfectly

 Mr Linklater, consider yourself redeemed!

 A very "nice" movie

 See this fantastic love story Before Sunrise.

 Amazing - Ethan was good

 A Sweet Dream

 A romantic movie for the thinking man and woman
