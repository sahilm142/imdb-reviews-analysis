 Hard to define, generation-defining that endured

 Still holds up!

 I almost Loved It

 Pure Comedy

 Spoiler !

 The best comedy TV show nowadays

 will we ever see a show like this again?

 Entertaining TV show!

 Six Friends Live in Manhattan

 great!!!!!

 A great sitcom to watch

 Great chemistry

 Pretty Darn FUNNY

 A fairy tale sitcom

 Good but overrated

 Friends - Like These

 One of my favorite shows, but full of plot holes.

 Great in places, some episodes still hold up but other than that hasn't aged great

 A Modern Day Saved by the Bell
