 I cant believe how overrared this is

 Just a family drama

 Awful

 Don't get it

 Too many monologues

 Soap opera with CGI ghosts

 Yawn

 What a let down

 Strong beginning, worst ending ever.

 OMG is this a poorly told story

 The Current 8.9 IMDb rating is a hoax!

 I have no idea why people love this

 Joke of a series

 Totally mediocre, and in a modern way.

 Remove from horror section please.

 Booooooooooring!

 I cant believe that score !

 dumb

 6 feet under melodrama
