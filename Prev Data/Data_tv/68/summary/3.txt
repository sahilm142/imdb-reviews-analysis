 Overrated Depressing Show

 At best its OK, at worst pretty boring

 The House that Halfwits Built

 Starts OK, then crawls downhill at a snail's pace

 Only redemption was how hilarious this show became at the end

 Not scary at all

 I think I'm going to be a minority here

 YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!

 Shirley Jackson must be rolling over in her grave

 Strong start, dismal end.

 Missing

 Starts strong, becomes painfully meandering

 Overrated

 "Dysfunctional family" bore-a-tlon drama with jump scares and crappy ending.

 Spoilers - Hugely overrated family drama, not really horror.

 What's all the fuzz about? Really?

 Slow and boring

 Netflix ruining a good story

 Totally overrated

 Totally overrated

 No scares here

 Mediocre At Best

 I don't get it!!

 Fans of the original book should avoid at all costs

 Boooooooring.....!
