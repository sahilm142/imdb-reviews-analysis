"Doctor Who" is awesome BBC show, on the air since 1963. There are 36 seasons so far, "divided" into two groups. The old "Doctor Who" had 26 seasons from 1963 till 1989, with almost seven hundred episodes, and the new one started in 2005, and we are currently waiting for the 11th season. This renewed series is one of the best shows ever, easily deserving 10/10. While waiting for the 11th season I decided to watch the original series. At the moment, I'm in the middle of the second season, and although it is pretty much outdated in every way, it is still very good show and, if you like the new Doctor Who, I recommend you to give a chance to old one too. You won't be disappointed.7/10


                
Like THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD (U.$. CEO Ronald Reagan), William Hartnell as Dr. Who comes across as more than just a tad "away in the head." The Daffy Doc often sets in motion events that end up backfiring on him. Although his newfound nemises, the Daleks, are just about as spineless in their protective cocoons as the current crop of Democrats in this country, the good doctor must rely on his unwitting and often unwilling allies to save his proverbial bacon. While the fx are a bit on the low-end side (the Daleks use toilet plungers as all-purpose tools, their limbs having atrophied) and the storyline(s) something less than compelling, it's the overall effect that's important: DR. WHO is Entertaining. Imaginative. It's easy to see why he's lasted (in various reincarnations) so long.
