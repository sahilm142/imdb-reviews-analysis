 Crazy, immensely entertaining conspiracy thriller with a unique look, pitch-black humour and an amazing soundtrack

 Bold, Brilliant, Original and yet strangely familiar

 Great show with a brilliant futuristic message

 Devastatingly Sublime

 Utopia

 Wonderful television

 Where we get a look into the apocalyptic abyss - for the better or worse.

 Must watch! No doubt!

 One of the best shows you've never heard of

 UK TV at its best!

 A great thriller... made me question every flu and virus in real life

 Fantastic series with some freshness

 So subversive I'm surprised it got made

 The greater evil or the greater good.

 I didn't realize there was a season 2

 An absolute thrill to watch

 A quirky grotesque dark comedic series.

 Absurdistic, highly etertaining series

 Quirky, colourful, unique

 Twisted TV the likes of which only the Brits can make

 I love this
