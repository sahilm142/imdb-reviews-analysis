 It was the Phoenix and not the Globe that broke this story

 BOOORING AS A FILM.... Robbed an Oscar just for the subject matter.

 Strong Subject - Good direction - but no story whatsoever !

 Easily one of, if not the, most over-hyped films of 2015.

 By the numbers

 I'd give it half a star if I could - Terrible movie

 never been so disappointed since the dog picture

 This film is a one trick pony

 Very boring movie

 Good movie
