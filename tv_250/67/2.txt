This show used to be good. I mean real good. It was very funny, smart, always up to date with the current events. The writers criticized everything that was wrong with the world. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode.But that's all in the past. I don't know, either the writers ran out of ideas, or the people writing the show are not the original writers, because nowadays the show is only about feces. Literally. Oh sorry, there are some Apple commercials in there too.I wish they would just cancel the show already, because all they do is smudge the good name of "South Park".
