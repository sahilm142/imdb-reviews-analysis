 Great Novel + False Hero = Spoiled Classic

 A Silly Movie

 a passable book becomes a terrible movie

 I just don't get it...

 Robert Mulligan killed a mockingbird

 Moral: It's OK to kill a 'bad' person

 No not watch this movie!

 School play on the big screen

 Even Worse Book

 This movie kept me wondering what it was about until it ended.
