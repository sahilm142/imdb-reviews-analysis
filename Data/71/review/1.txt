To say this was an unbearable movie would be an exaggeration. It was bearable, bearly, for about 35 minutes.Its an embarrassment to see this is associated with Pixar. I can only imagine they were for ed to put their name on it to collect royalities.It reeks of Disney and their predictable, overly saccachrine sentiments, with an incipid story, one dimensional characters and a mismoshnof ideas about themes and subplots.As a triumph of style over substance and a nod to ersatz cultural enlightenment this is a film that can't even justify the evidence of its exostence. Visually it is a mess and a kind of over stimulated version of a little childs video game. It is devoid of humor, genuine humanist expression and superficial smattering of the Day of the Dead celebration. The characters are so flat that both "alive" or dead they're boring.To compare this to typical landmark, groundbreaking Pixar movies calls into question wondering exactly what people were watching during Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, etc these early films took the legendary work of early Disney animation artists and elevated it to an entirely different place.they are layered, broadly appealling, entertaining and had a touch of social context and commentary. Truly wonderful movies that deliver viewing upon viewing.The horses are out of the pen at this point but Honestly - what the hell werevthese positive reviewers watching!!??


                
Disney new films are all garbage they try to bring mesages to this day and age but fail miserablely. This was there trashy attempt to focus thier monsterosity of hispanic. I am ashamed to be hispanic from watching this filth. Disney has to stop with there god awful films. Dont watch this toilet garbage filth unless you are dumb so be it
Or do you seriously believe that this movie is better than classics like:-Saving Private Ryan
-Casablanca
-Terminator 1 and 2
-Back to the Future
-Citizen Kane
-Reservoir Dogsand many, many more? What a joke, this overhyped and overrated movie isn't even the best pixar movie...


                
You ever tell when a piece of art was just slopply and thrown together with NO COHESIVENESS? This is an example.Pretty weak and boring expectable story. It's saving grace is family morals at the end, but it really doesn't capture MUSIC. 1st because the music in the movie IS NOT MEMORABLE. How can you make a movie about music and the music not be LEGENDARY? And it's not like the formula is hard, find great guitarists like Paco De Lucia and others to score the film VS wanabbe composers.2 stars for having some morals, a waste of time otherwise.


                
And by "again" I mean they used the exact same formula they've used in countless other films that either people refuse to see or they've been blinded by the whole "it's Pixar, they do no wrong!" So I'm sorry Pixar and Coco fans but I didn't like this! The set up is the same with practically EVERYTHING Pixar makes and everyone falls for it every time! I'm sure this thing will win a lot of awards, that wasn't even in question in a year of many lackluster animated films. But in any other year, such as last it wouldn't of faired so well up next to more powerful stories and all around better animated films. I'd say give this one a few months and it'll quickly be forgotten!


                
I have no clue why people liked it. I couldn't even finish the movie because it was so boring. Story is too cliche even for animation. The characters are really bad and not-relatable, especially how they were talking was super annoying. I don't think Mexicans speak like that.Graphics were good as usual but I'm still going to give 1 star, since I feel like Pixar just waisted their talented time on this piece of crap.


                
The CGI in this movie is great . But the story line was pointless and nothing to do with Coco. It was more about the family Rivera. It's should of been called, "Miguel" or the " the Rivera's".


                
I only watched one minute but couldn't continue past it. It was awful. Terrible music right off the bat plus terrible animation. Wish I could watch more but why would I want to. This movie made me want to quit watching instantly. Can't give it a chance if they don't even try at the beginning.


                
Big disappointment. The movie should of been called, the Rivera family. I can't belive that they made a Mexican legend into the villain. There is more I want to say. I'm just going to let it go. As a Hispanic, this movie was a Big disappointment.
