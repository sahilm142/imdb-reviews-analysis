 Inside the head of Pixar

 Tremendous

 A beautiful and amazing movie with a good message and great characters.

 Pixar and Disney, can't get better then that

 Inventive, Engaging, and Funny, Inside Out has the Peak-Pixar Flavor We Haven't Seen in Years

 Another Pixar Classic

 The most moving and funny Pixar film in a long time.

 Hands down! Animation's finest!

 A return to form for Pixar.

 Aside from a few slow portions in the middle, a marvelous film from Disney.
