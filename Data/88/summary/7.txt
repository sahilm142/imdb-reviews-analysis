 Ahead of its time but...

 Mind-boggling, especially for its time

 Deserves its status as a classic

 a huge disappointment

 The worst movie I've seen.

 The First "Critically Acclaimed" Film I Didn't Like

 Fantastic Art film...Mediocre Film.

 Ugh

 An Epic Film Too Ambitious for its Own Good.

 The special effects are better than CGI in most movies today

 Before Spielberg there was Stanley

 Have I just been insulted?

 Another big screen marvel,utterly lost on small screen

 Cinematic achievement = entertaining movie? Not necessarily

 Game changer but boring

 Stoners in Space, sober-folk stuck on Earth

 Though not prescient, it's visually stunning with an excellent score

 A great classic SF, but not as good as most think

 Overrated

 Lost in middle-of-the-fence outer space

 A qualified success

 Better the second time around

 Not what I once thought

 Too Clinical to be Engaging

 Stunning but overrated space adventure
