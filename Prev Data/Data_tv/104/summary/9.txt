 Getting better with time!

 Second season saves!

 Like Top Gear, but fun

 The magic's still there...

 Season Three, Hits the shows stride

 Full season based review.

 just had to be

 The Grand Tour is truly GRAND.

 'The grand is an unique show and can not be compared to the old Top Gear'

 Missed'em

 TGT (The Grand Tour OR Top Gear Two)

 my opinion about the grand tour

 Absolutely Loved it

 Awesome

 Sound and breathtaking adventures

 Episode 2 wasn't as good as Ep 1 but still very good

 Brilliant auto show featuring 3 old stooges

 Feels Forced, Lacks Magic, Still Enjoyable

 Kinda like Top Gear, but not quite

 The gang is back!

 The Three Guys Hit Again!

 ... Top Gear with all the charm and none of the boring bits however it does have a few boring bits of its own that need work.

 I missed these middle aged car lovers

 Brilliance at its finest!

 The real "top gear"
