This movie comes along with many headlines claiming that there is now finally a realistic portrait of the G.D.R. (i.e., the former socialistic eastern part of Germany). Actually, it tells us much more about the present situation in Germany, the lack of critical awareness and anticipatory obedience.The plot is quickly told. The East German minister for culture (Thomas Thieme) gets randy at a popular actress (Martina Gedeck, playing one of these notorious "beautiful faces of communism"), and orders the Stasi (East German Secret Service) to observe, and eventually eliminate, her lover, a conformist playwright (Sebastian Koch). Chain of command goes down to the Stasi captain (Ulrich Muehe, star of the movie), who initially keeps his duty with his approved loyalty, but questions his activities in the course of time and during this distant confrontation with his victim. Finally, of course, he becomes a "good man".Probably you don't need to know East Germany to see how ridiculous this is. To name a few points, for the Nomenklatura of the communist party, political power was more than a perfect substitute for sex, to an extend that they were closely controlling that only puritanic characters would enter the inner circles, or getting expelled otherwise (e.g. Konrad Naumann). As often mentioned, a minister for culture hadn't the power to command the Stasi for such tasks. Moreover, East Germany was anxiously to keep the opportunistic (and even the semi-opportunistic) intellectuals in good mood, actually making this land a kind of paradise for a certain type of artists. Of course, nobody who suffered from a tough Stasi watchdog would believe the wonderful change of mind pictured here.The movie has some good points. First, the actors are very good, especially brilliant (as usual) Mr. Muehe. Secondly, it is not on of these light-hearted comedies painting the G.D.R. with nostalgic colours (though it inherits some of their cheap jokes, like the running gags about the East German furniture). Unfortunately, this second point doesn't make the movie more realistic. The G.D.R. WAS a non-democratic state, with a huge load of injustice and cruelty, but it didn't work this way (though it is obvious that the director got some advice for the technical details of surveillance, but that's not the point). Actually, the director (who has no experience with the GDR society, which was claimed to be a merit by the German media) perfectly reflects how an average West-German artist (due to his natural limitations in experience) imagines the past of the East. No wonder this movie is a success. First of all, the conflict in the G.D.R. was about the society, not about sex. This is of course hard to imagine for modern pop-artists, whose only contact with reality is sex, and therefore the only propelling force. Secondly, a realistic movie about the G.D.R. should NOT play in East Berlin. It was the city of the mandarins of the socialistic society, life was fair and easy compared with the rest of the land. There were good reasons why the revolution in 1989 didn't start there. Thirdly, one should not take over the stories of some pseudo-dissidents who invented fashionable curricula to get a good start in the other part of Germany. These stories were simply manufactured to flatter the new rulers and get easy money. Unfortunately, this movie does perfectly the same (for business details, it would also be instructive to analyze how helpful an aristocratic title in the neo-feudalistic German society is to get the money for the production and friendly media). What is also painfully lacking, is a feeling for today's morals of the story. Indeed, a similar surveillance could happen nowadays in the course of "anti-terrorism" in many countries (again, the movie has nothing to do specifically with the G.D.R.). There is obviously some fear of the author's to show that many of the G.D.R. institutional criminals are now very successful in the "new" Germany. Do you want a really specific German Stasi story? Imagine a close friend of a high rank Stasi officer, who founded a "democratic" party in 1989 to infiltrate the movement and/or get along with the new times, and follow her way through many surprising turns and strange political miracles till she finally ends as the head of the "new" Germany.
THE LIFE OF OTHERS (Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck - Germany 2006).DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN won practically every award it competed for and after it has won the Oscar for best foreign language film, I became a tad suspicious. Most films that won the Academy Award for best foreign language film are usually two-penny tragedies at best or grotesque monstrosities, but since this is the first feature by writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (I couldn't have picked a better name for a Prussian junker), I gathered it must have been the script above anything else that made his effort worth seeing. Sadly, he proves himself more of a decent - if somewhat unimaginative - cinematographer than a writer. The film seems to have been targeted at international audiences with scant knowledge of German history. That's fine by me, if an engaging storyline can make up for the sometimes insultingly obvious remarks some of the characters make about East-West relations or daily life in East Germany. The first half hour is full of over-explanatory comments about day-to-day practices, mostly rehashing Western capitalist clichés and some truly awful jokes, delivered in such an abysmal way (the jokes themselves not being that awful), not even the world's greatest comedian could make it work. Injecting heavy-handed films with humor is never easy. If the film intends to give the audience an idea what day-to-day life was like in the GDR, he did a good job. An almost total absence of colour, excitement or hope.Stasi officer Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is a caricature of German punctuality. When he attends a party in celebration of the latest play by writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), he suggests to his superior officer - also at the party - Dreyman may be flirting with The West as well. Next, he wiretaps Dreyman's apartment and installs himself in an empty attic in the apartment building. Dreyman's supposedly subversive activities were a bit hazy to me and why officer Wiesler commits himself to this case, remains unclear. He doesn't have a life outside his work. I guess the next inevitably constitutes some spoilers.*** SPOILERS AHEAD *** Years after the Wende, Dreyman is told that his house was wired and his every move was monitored by the Stasi. To my astonishment, he seems completely surprised by this piece of information. How could this be? How could a well-known writer, or any intellectual for that matter, in East Germany, not even assume his every move is being watched? Even cleaning ladies assumed they could be monitored and spied upon. That was the whole essence of life in East Germany. The trauma of East German citizens perennially paranoid of one another. Initially, this seemed the outlook of the film itself, but the only conclusion I could draw was that a) I missed out on some essential piece of information or b)Dreyman's character didn't know. In that case, it would make him pretty dim-witted.*** SPOILERS END *** The period and feeling of the GDR is well-captured and I must admit, the final denouement of Wiesler walking the streets of Berlin, alone and bereft of any goal in life after the demise of East Germany, was kind of moving, but as a whole, very disappointing.Camera Obscura --- 4/10
I must say that ever since watching this picture I felt that it was grossly overrated, mainly because of its artistic limitations and because I felt that it does no justice to its hype.While the Stasi investigation methods portrayed here are definitely correct and meticulously researched by the director for a period of (reportedly) 1.5 years, the characters come across as extremely shallow. It looks as if the director/script writer first picked up a certain Stasi lingo/ investigatory framework and then built his film around that, rather than working from existing characters. That gives the story a decidedly artificial feel.Therefore none of the figures really convinced me, safe Ulrich Mühe's lead of course. Yet this Swan-Lake-like performance of a brilliant actor who already knew that he was terminally ill at the time of the shoot may raise this film out of the realm of the ordinary, but it still has all the makings of a sophisticated TV movie rather than a theatrical release. Also, as someone who grew up (in part) in East Germany, I must say that the portrayal of a state-endorsed writer appears to be intolerably naive, and that in order to achieve such a rank, it would have been quite necessary to sell out on your colleagues way before this painful choice presents itself in the movie. And, pardon me, but Sebastian Koch is a TV actor, and a pretty bad one at that.Worst of all, the sappy soundtrack by otherwise fondly remembered Gabriel Yared transforms the already debatable historical drama into mere kitsch - the music feels like glue at times. It would seem that it was precisely this kitsch-cliché aspect which made this film such a success with American critics and aged intellectuals, but for German audiences (at least me and my friends) it added to a calculated shallowness that may serve to win an Academy Award, but doesn't really do justice to its subject. The director's follow-up 'The Tourist' has been rightfully criticized for pretty much the same reasons given here, so hopefully the undue support for this film will be reconsidered.
A film that I was looking forward too, a film that beat both 'Pan's Labyrinth' and 'After the wedding' to best foreign film Oscar at this years ceremony and a film in which I must be missing something. What was this all about? Well I know what it was about, not much, nearly three hours of not much to be precise. Long, grey and boring the cast, especially the Stasi officer (who spend most of the film sat at a desk) must have loved that pay check, quite literally money for nothing. Now there was a nice little thing at the end and the odd bit here and there but that should have taken no more than say twenty minutes to do. Maybe if each showing came with a lecture first filling in the history of the piece it may have been a little different, after all if you didn't live in Germany in 1984 and didn't know all about how the Stasi monitored everyone including each other during that period frequently bugging flats, phones and conducting surveillances then like me you would have been quite lost as the film throws you into to the story. Basically a playwright is being watched by an officer, playwright decides to write some propaganda, officer covers for him because under that evil interrogating exterior beats a heart of grey. That took me less than a minute to write how the hell did they string it out for so long? Anyway this has to be one of the worst foreign films I have seen in a long time, the story is slight, the actors underused, the idea overused and it was just too long. But like I say I might be missing something here as I seem to be in a minority, most reviews have given full stars, one said it wasn't just the best foreign film of the year but the best film period. I'm not sure they see enough films to be honest and I would question if they are actually qualified to do reviews? So in my opinion this really is a case of don't believe the hype and a waste of a golden statue.
Well, I had high hopes of this movie before getting all set to finally watch this. The theme is great. The outline is impressive, but the narration is below par, lifeless at times. Certain characterizations seem rather too much to agree to a country where minimum freedom is a comfort. Wiesler, the mysterious soul of the movie fails to impress doing deeds that makes no sense to the situation and really doesn't give a reality touch to his action since he had duly seen n dealt with the predicaments and difficulties there.Ending really touches. But, for what it's worth, it can be applauded vaguely as a non creative drama. Academy award? really?
Why and how did this film win the Oscar for best foreign language film 2006???? Clearly "Pan's Labrynth" should have won. I was eager to see "The Live of Others" after it had won the Oscar, and now that I have seen it my my question is why did it win? Politics? The Lola prize? Preferences for German films? Color theory? Actor preferences? Discovery Channel fans? This film had a major inauthentic hole. It is completely PRETENTIOUS to believe that a police investigator changed his attitude towards his work and towards his victims because of his exposure to art, specifically to his exposure to music from Beethoven. Was this a comedy? This film had almost everything else going for it, but the premise was so bogus that it made the rest of the film unforgivable. The acting was good. The scenery gray and tyrannical. The reality of East Berlin was authentic, but once again the premise was NOT authentic. No one, no one changes because they heard a score from Beethoven and or saw a play. They may be affected by that for a little while, but they go back to being themselves thereafter, especially a cold-blooded, career-oriented police investigator from the Stasi. Maybe if he had taken piano lessons for five years he would had changed and had seen his humanity, and the humanity of others, but not because he heard his victims playing a piano piece. BS!!! Rescind the Oscar and give it to Pan's Labrynth !


                
I did not find this film that much stunning. The book story is alright but the films on Germans do really have that much reputation if you make a movie on anything it will be OK. I do not think that film is a great one. Yes you can watch it with a talkative guy even while writing a word document or surfing in the internet. The film is really slow. T-I do not mean a low film is not a good one. But this film does not have that much inside it. Moreover in this slowness you do not find anything poetic, literal, or gorgeous cinematography. Just ordinary shooting and very ordinary story. Do not watch alone. Read a spoiler. Enough. The story is good.
