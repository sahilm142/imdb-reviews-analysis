 open to a female audience, entertaining, historically accurate - not representative

 I watched it in one breath

 4 years of War on the Eastern Front

 Very Good

 Entertaining and sobering story about 5 young Germans living in WW2.

 Very Deep, Very Tragic, But Not Perfect Take

 With hope for deliverance

 Excellent with a few minor points

 Great crash course in to the Nazi Germany

 Growing Up, You Don't See The Writing On the Wall

 A giftedly accomplished and versatile creation about missed hopes and opportunities

 War in all its unglamorous horror

 Good but a bit too contrived

 Refreshing - WWII from a German perspective
