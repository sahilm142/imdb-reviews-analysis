 What Joey is to Friends, rather than what Frasier is to Cheers.

 Marathon Race That Never Reaches The Finish Line

 Could be better

 Too slow

 I wanted to Love this series

 Cinematography excellent but the show is a dud

 spin off light in all departments

 Breaking bad's overrated little brother

 Very disappointed

 What A Disappointment!

 Don't waste your time

 In love with breaking bad heartbroken better call saul
