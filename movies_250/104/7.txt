SNATCH (2000) Director Guy Ritchie flix this must have movie into the South - English culture with brutal gangsters and one punching taters.Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Benicio del Toro, Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones, all this good actors operates in this violent crime comedy that really entertians you! Depressive and smartass mood twisted into a state of mind of strong language and rough'n'tough characters. Explosive with its brutal way of telling its story. Benicio del Toro and Brad Pitt steals much of the show with their two indispensable parts of the movie (though del Toro's not too big). It may have some things like remind you off Fight Club and stuff, but it is without doubt very much the same of Ritchie's other English gangster movie Lock, Stock and Two smoking Barrels (also with Vinnie Jones). The story is fast and very nice put together where you switch cameras sometimes and may in the background you can see things happening in the other camera view, very good Guy!Statham is great and together with his partner Tommy they work for a brtual and disgusting gangster boss. They hire Mickey, a hard punching man living off selling caravans and loves his mum. We also get too mett Franky Four Fingers that are coming over from USA with some heavy diamonds...and more like that stuff... It is all about it's tagline: Stealin' stones Breakin' bones STARS: **** 4/5 (fast, violent and ugly)


                
SPOILERS:: I cannot discuss my reaction to "Snatch" (which I suppose relates to the "snatching" of the large diamond) without commenting on the Imdb ratings. Currently it is #142 with a rating of 8.1, primarily by virtue of most voters being under 29, and I suspect most under 21. Among the "over 30" crowd, the rating is 7.5, which seems to me just about right. In many respects it deserves highest ratings for style, action, witty dialog. But the story, which is a bit convoluted and which involves all bad guys, as in "Lock, Stock...", is a rather poor one. As one professional reviewer said, "Guy Ritchie doesn't really want us to care about the story, it's all about the action."My main interest in seeing the movie was Brad Pitt. From the trailers, I was intrigued by his gypsy character, a bare-fist fighting champion who only needs one punch.  I think his performance is the highlight of the entire film, and again Pitt shows, as he did in "Fight Club" and "Twelve Monkeys", that he is one of the better and more versatile males actors.
James Barardinelli and Roger Ebert have excellent summaries of the film. For highlights, I really thought the dog swallowing the squeek toy, and "squeek-barking" was funny, as was "Something to declare? Yes, don't go to England." Much of the dark humor in "Snatch" arises from the ineptitude of the various crooks. If they were serious, competent crooks, then the film would not be very interesting. "Slapstick Crooks" would be a better name.The camerawork and editing, as well as the dynamic 5-channel sound, were all first-rate. Ritchie is certainly in a different league there. I will keep watching his films for their entertainment value, but it would be easy to criticize him for all the violence, a la "Pulp Fiction", and pervasive use of foul language.  We just have to remind ourselves, "It's only a movie."
Having seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels by the same writer/director, Guy Ritchie, and loved it, I very much looked forward to seeing this film.  While the story was different, the over all pacing, confrontations, and plot twists were very much the same.  It was if I had already seen it before.  Worth seeing nonetheless, especially if you haven't seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.


                
The British film industry is lucky.  Guy Ritchie doesn't like flying!The main criticism I'd heard regarding this film was that it was just more of the same from its predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Well I'd rather have a Lock Stock'2 than the 50 Runaway Brides that Hollywood deems worthy to force upon us each year!Of course it is impossible to avoid comparisons with Ritchie's remarkable debut.  The trademarks are all here - the larger than life criminal underworlders (including more racial stereotypes than all the Bond films put together), the far-fetched farcical plot, and the comicbook violence. However, Snatch is an altogether darker, harder tonic to swallow. 
While Snatch may be a lot darker in tone, with hard edged depictions of life in the depths of the criminal underworld (most notably the dog-fighting), it still delivers plenty of punch in its comedy.  The cast all seem to thoroughly enjoy their roles (most of which are pretty much straightforward cameos) with Brad Pitt perhaps steeling the show with his spot on coherently-challenged Gypsy boxer.Snatch is a brutally stylish, wickedly enjoyable British gangster film. More of the same then!


                
I'm not sure if this is a **SPOILER** or not, as it deals with camera work and not so much with plot.  I saw this movie knowing nothing about it except that it was by "the guy who did Lock, Stock" (which I didn't really like too much).  I think that knowing nothing may have made me enjoy it more.You've been warned.  :)You've all read about the actors, Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro were excellent, as usual, but the thing that blew me away was the camera work and the editing job done on this one.Every once in a while we see these great little 2-3 second clips that tell a whole story through about 20 different shots thrown at the audience so quickly that you'd miss them if you blinked.The only one I think I could possibly explain through a text based comment is the great way characters travel overseas:two men, one in London one in the US are on the phone.man in the US:  "I'll be right there"-shot of car screeching away-shot of passport stamp-shot of US man taking a shot-shot of plane taking off-shot of plane landing-shot of passport stamp-shot of car screeching away-show of US man standing in London man's officeall that happens in about 1 second.  :)  It's great!Aside from being amazed at the camera work, the story was interesting and original.  The characters were funny and well cast, and the dog was fantastic!All you "it's Lock, Stock part Two!" critics should give this director a break and appreciate this film on it's own.I rated this an 8.0 on IMDB.
'Snatch (2000)' is an energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors in which whatever could go wrong does go wrong. It's a series of eventually intertwining parallel stories each centred around a stolen stone which feature a cast of colourful, mostly inept characters with slightly weird names and a mainly cockney lilt (aside from the Russian, the American and the sort-of-but-not-really Irish thing that Brad Pitt tries to do). It deals in stereotypes and the comedy is pretty broad, but the film isn't so much funny as it is exhaustively coincidental in a strangely compelling way, with the usually dumb-as-bricks characters making a major mistake only to run into someone (sometimes literally) who then fixes that mistake or changes their path entirely. It's not so much a straightforward narrative as one that keeps you guessing as to where it's going to go while simultaneously not mattering at all, as it's the individual situations themselves that entertain. The fact it all ties together in the end is, strangely, kind of a bonus. 7/10


                
Snatch is a very cool action-film that a few people know each other and then it will be a fight between them.I like this sort of films which fight each other and it will be a terrific fight until the end of the film.I like actor as Benicio Del Toro and Brad Pitt and they act very well and Guy Ritchies directing are fantastic! Guy Ritchie can make a action-film with much exciting and fighting and that is fun to watch.I recommended Snatch to everyone who like to watch a film with fun and action!I want to warn sensitive persons of a few violent scenes!


                
This movie has a lot of things. Action,Comedy,drama,Brad Pitt as an Irish boxer and a massive diamond. It was great. A must-see.Some might get annoyed by the camera work. The camera zooms in and out and spins around. I didn't mind it. It made it feel fast-paced.I loved the cast. Brad Pitt was great as the Irish boxer who no one can understand. Vinnie Jones plays a great gangster but i didn't like how his character was wrapped up at the very end of the movie. Dennis Farina(who i know from law & order)was very surprising. This has to be my favorite Jason Statham performance.As this is a gangster movie there is violence in this. But most of it is seen off camera.I recommend this. It is a good movie to watch with some friends. 7/10


                
This movie was very fun.Brad Pitt has an excellent performance.Benicio del Toro has a small,but excellent performance.This is a fun action comedy with a great style,but I thought this was going to be better.I expected more from this movie.The scene in which Avi takes a taxi and then he goes to New York is great.This is a fun movie,with good action scenes and touches of humor but,like I said before,I expected more.I think the genre of the movie is modern film noir with touches of humor.That description is a bit strange but if you see the movie you will see that it is not a strange description.So watch this fun movie because it is good.


                
A huge diamond is stolen in a heist in Antwerp and taken to London, but winds up in the hands of three petty crooks, who fall foul of a local gangster. Meanwhile, a street-boxing promoter hires an unlikely gypsy to take a dive in a match organised by said gangster. When he wins instead, things turn nasty. Also involved are a dodgy diamond merchant, his American cousin, a Russian gun-runner and a manhunter. Much confusion ensues.Writer-director Ritchie's second movie is a terrific gangster farce, a violent Cockney version of The Pink Panther, as the jewel passes back and forward between various unwitting characters with great names like Franky Four Fingers, Doug The Head and Bullet Tooth Tony. The wonderful script weaves together two separate story lines and a dozen different main characters so swiftly it leaves you gasping. The cast are fantastic, if only for their sheer variety; Statham is wonderful as the milk-drinking, much put-upon Turkish, and plays the whole movie with one amusing expression of slightly confused irritation. Ford, as arch-villain Bricktop, complete with yellow teeth and Health Service glasses, is a stunningly evil geezer, whose speech on the practicalities of feeding dead bodies to pigs is one of the film's highlights. Pitt is memorable in a flashy part as the incomprehensible bare-knuckle boxer ("D'ya loike dags ?"), and Graham, Farina, Jones and Reid all lend great support. Filled with eye-popping moments and lots of snazzy dialogue ("Who took the jam out of your doughnut ?"), this a terrific, hilarious, supercool crime caper filled with an irresistible gallery of lowlifes. Never bet against a gypsy.
Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels 2? Wouldn't really sound right would it? So what do you do? First of all you don't change the plot outline much (London gangsters in a pickle) but you do make a couple of slight cast alterations. Brad Pitt? Ah, why not he's a good looking guy after all. Only here, he is a gypsy boxer and puts in one of the best performances of his career. In my humble opinion Guy Ritchie is a fantastic director. His style is cool and dialogue hilarious. He is a cross between Tarantino (for the plots) and P.T. Anderson (for his knack of coaxing out great performances from less than great actors). So why did he do Swept Away?! Personally I don't think snatch is as good as LOCK STOCK... but is lighter and funnier. ***1/2 out of *****


                
The first time I watched this flick I was sorely disappointed...it was basically Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with a couple of different characters and Brad Pitt. Upon a second viewing, roughly 2 years later, it stands as a decent, funny movie...as long as LSATSB isn't fresh in your mind. Good soundtrack regardless.


                
In spite of appropriating both the essence and part of the story of `The Watch' section of `Pulp Fiction', this is a pleasant, though violent, diversion, fast-paced and filled with a large ensemble of memorable characters with lots of juicy lines to say. The writer/director, Guy Ritchie, doesn't seem interested in much more than showing what he's learned from watching Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese and providing a rip-roaring good time; the actors seem to be having fun as well. It's a crime comedy about a large diamond that gets passed around the underworld boxing scene in London and although the dialogue is mostly delivered with thick Cockney accents, the injection of a sizable Hollywood contingent (including Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and, as a gypsy with unintelligible diction, Brad Pitt) as well as the directorial influence gives the film a decidedly American feel. No great shakes but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours either.


                
I actually had no desire to see this movie...but my brother practically forced me to watch it and after i did....i wanted to watch it again... The characters were so funny and yet believable at the same time.  I loved Brad Pitt in this movie b/c he wasnt used as another pretty boy...the character of Turkish (also narrater) was my absolute favorite.  If you had reservations about seeing this movie discard them and get it.  Its funny, thrilling and keeps you guessing as to what is going on.


                
Guy Ritchie has recreated what he did with LockStock and it is true that Snatch is cinematographically a more accomplished movie than his full-length debut.If you were a fan of the old movie (that is having seen it 10+ times) you will be disappointed, otherwise it truly is a great and entertaining movie.This should probably work well in America where LockStock was not as big as it was in England.7/10


                
Although I don't consider "Lock, Stock,..." to be as good as "Reservoir Dogs", I believe "Snatch" is the brittish version of "Pulp Fiction", with different sense of humour and coolness. There's no Samuel L. Jackson in "Snatch" but there is a funny (and excellent) Brad Pitt; there aren't as many colours in "Snatch" as in "Pulp Fiction", but there's a lot more red blood (!); ... All these comparisons can be easily made between these two movies, but "Snatch" will never match up to "Pulp Fiction": this "new wave" of gangster movies is born right out of their time. And why does Guy Ritchie like to confuse the audience with a large-numbered cast? He did it in "Lock, Stock, ..." and he does it here again! Final though: "Snatch" with its character development and even story unleashing is the bigger-cast and bigger-budget version of "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels".


                
Funny, well directed but unfortunately NOT original. Same plot with "Lock Stock and Two smoking Barrels". Anyone that has seen that, will understand how similar the two movies are. The truth is that I expected something more from the director as I was thrilled when I saw his previous movie "Lock Stock...".


                
Dead good fun, with the emphasis on the word 'dead' - there is so much violent death in this film that it would be shocking if it wasn't all so tongue-in-cheek. Clever situations abound in the story of the chase for a priceless diamond - a personal favourite is the dog swallowing a squeaky toy pig, a running joke that eventually proves decisive to the plot. But spot the difference between this film and director Guy Ritchie's equally quirky and fun 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' - there isn't much, in fact. Both have in common various London low-lifes after a valuable 'MacGuffin', an identical in-your-face style and Vinnie Jones. All great fun, even the second time around ... but a third outing would be stretching it, I reckon.


                
Having liked Lock, Stock... a lot, I came to this with plenty of expectations and received very few surprises. It does all of the same things as Guy Ritchies first hit - some of them better and some worse. The plotting was if anything even tighter, the script funny in parts but far too much of a retread to produce much in the way of real laughs. Brad Pitt was excellent and featured in practically every memorable scene in the film, which came as something of a surprise to me. The greatest disappointment for me, though, was the selection of music for the soundtrack which was decidedly lacklustre - even moreso in comparison with the truly excellent soundtrack which accompanied Lock, Stock...


                
Tag-Line (EUR): "SNATCH- now you see it, now you dont!--you wha-?"Snatch was voted the best film of 2000 in the United Kingdom, and stayed a favourite for months in the charts of Europe too. The build upto this film was more anticipated in England and Europe than it was in the US, because of the initial impact of Guy Rithice's recent 1998 independant release of "Lock, Stock & Two-Smoking Barrels." Snatch uses pretty much the same script plan as Lock, Stock, only with a much larger budjet at hand, as well as some big hollywood names in the pan. The film's identity is dogged down with the appearance of Bennico Del torro (FRANKY-FOUR FINGERS), & partly by Brad Pitt (MICKEY). But somehow in an odd way, Pitt balances out nicely and does the film jusitce with his exellent take to a seedy pikey (Irish-liek slang, but either Irish or English dialect) accent, and dodgy make-over. Dennis Farina (COUSIN AVI), without making any offense...does a great, if not comical job of portraying the frustrated, greedy American/Jewish diamond jewller intent on getting things flow his own way, fed up with the constant "alienation" from his much-loved artificial world of ritches, facing upto a hunt into the heart of the seedy British underworld. The film is fast paced with shifty, effective editing techniques (more jumpier than the ones in Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, that diserse the viewer from the past to the present, and add enthusiasim to the shear comedy of the irony which is "accidental." I must have seen Snatch at least 30 times now, both sitting down and while I'm working" Overall, an exellent to watch with anyone, but for the real macoy watch Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.


                
Snatch is a stylish crime/comedy that excels in its crafty writing and spot-on direction from Guy Ritchie. Also, the performers are perfect for each of their roles and there's not a single bad actor in the bunch. Standouts include Brad Pitt as a speed-talking Irish gypsy, Alan Ford as the wicked Brick Top, and Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony. Guy Ritchie improves greatly over his last movie, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, which had several actors that appear in Snatch as well(look hard!). The only problem with the movie is that the fast pace of the story and the sometimes-hard-to-follow dialects will throw off people who just want simple laughs. Definitely worth a rental.  1-10  Overall--7.5 Direction--7 Writing--8.5 Acting--7.5 Music--7


                
Snatch is a good film, I liked it. But whilst watching it you can't help but feel that you're seeing an alternate version of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Vinnie is playing the same character. The plot is based around a bunch of people trying to obtain something for an gangster boss in exchange for their lives. Similar sorts of comic situations. Etc.I personally felt that the "original" was funnier, better directed, and with a better balance of characters. Although Snatch is a good film, I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't spent much of it feeling I'd seen it all before.


                
Guy Ritchie's `Snatch' is a highly entertaining crime caper featuring innovative (and often brilliant) direction as well as a horde of memorable, over-the-top characters. The direction and the characters are so good, in fact, that it's quite easy to overlook the threadbare story buried at the bottom of the film. `Snatch' is a great example of a film that excels at flash, flair and extraneous details . . . but has some significant problems with its basic foundation. The end results are still remarkably good, but the flaws <U+0096> while covered up incredibly well -- are enough to keep `Snatch' from achieving the greatness that it comes so close to grasping. (Or snatching, as the case may be.)The film begins with underground fight promoter Turkish (Jason Statham), a decent guy running with a bad crowd, agreeing to put one his fighters in a fixed bout for the big-time criminal Brick Top (Alan Ford). Meanwhile, Franky Four Fingers (Del Toro), who has recently stolen an eighty-five carat diamond for his boss Cousin Avi (Farina), has decided to place some bets on Brick Top's fixed fight.  Nothing goes even remotely right for anyone, of course, and soon there's a mad search on for the diamond by a number of low-life hoodlums, as well as some problems arising from Turkish's new bare-knuckle brawler, a Gypsy named Mickey (Brad Pitt). .  .
`Snatch' is a film that's pure eye candy, which is why it's such a joy to watch. Give Guy Ritchie massive amounts of credit -- the man's quite a director. He's a master at editing scenes together in innovative ways, and putting together otherwise ordinary scenes with ingenious and creative methods. `Snatch' is a veritable how-to handbook on visual directing techniques, and it's almost a downright guilty pleasure watching Mr. Ritchie construct this film into such a vibrant, dazzling-looking finished product. The same must be said for the characters, who seem to have come from a place somewhere between `Dick Tracy' and `Reservoir Dogs' -- each and every character in `Snatch' is a distinct and memorable creation, worthy of starring in their own movie, every if they're only on screen for a few moments. (Cousin Avi, Doug the Head, Frankie Four Fingers, Boris the Blade .. . good gravy, where does Guy Ritchie get these wonderful names?) All the characters in `Snatch' <U+0096> and the terrific actors playing them -- are simply awesome. If any deserve special mention, though, it's Jason Statham as the beleaguered fight manager Turkish and Vinnie Jones as the villainous Bullet Tooth Tony. (Any mainstream action film producer would be wise to cast Vinnie Jones as the main villain in any upcoming summer blockbuster; it's almost scary how well Mr. Jones can play a cold-blooded killer.) The characters are an utter joy to watch, and they're filmed in such a highly original and entertaining manner that `Snatch' actually stands apart from other standard action films and independent Tarantino wannabes as something worth watching.The real problem with `Snatch', though, is that for all its wonderful scenes and awesome characters . . . there's simply not enough story to go around. There's two basic storylines for the film, both pretty good -- but even combined, these storylines are barely enough to last an hour. On the commentary track for the DVD of `Snatch', Guy Ritchie states that his goal for the film was to make a lean and mean story -- well, he succeeded at that goal, but the lean, mean story gets completely bogged down from the weight of its overwhelming horde of characters. Despite how good they are, `Snatch' either would've benefited from a reduction of its cast, if only to provide more time to focus on the storylines; or the addition of a third storyline giving some of the characters more to do also could've helped. (It also might've helped if there was more correlation between the two storylines; the relationship between the two is cursory at best. What's going on in one storyline usually has only slight, minor repercussions affecting the other, and most of the time `Snatch' feels like two distinct and separate small films.)`Snatch' is a terrific joy ride of a film. The only problem is that the ride really doesn't go anywhere. Still, `Snatch' is one of the best-looking films of the year, and even if it's not necessarily the most satisfying of films, it's certainly a heck of a lot of fun. Worth checking out, for sure. Grade: B+


                
Guy Ritchie isn't funny.  I'm sorry but I don't see why everyone is plugging him as something so great.  I think the only reason his stuff is in the limelight is because he married Madonna.  The funniest part of this movie is the dog that eats the pink rubber ball , squeaking every time he barks.  Haha...VERY funny...whatever.This movie is slighty funnier than Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.  I give this one a 6 out of 10.
