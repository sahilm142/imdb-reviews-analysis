 Insipid – The pointless film.

 Overrated because it makes people "feel" smart...

 hopefully more people who rightly thought this was rubbish

 Overrated

 Inception is a poor representation of the dream world - Look elsewhere, this one is too literal and unimaginative.

 A Challenge to Those People Who Thought This Movie 'Made Sense'

 Inception: A Fail

 A boring pedantic sterile experience...

 Pretentious Load of Crap!

 Nolan's Inception Steals Idea from Novelist

 It's absurdity at its best.

 One of the most over-hyped movies of the decade

 Terrible - fell short in every aspect

 Hard 2 believe is not intellectually or morally challenging

 Hollywood Detritius

 What a far fetched story

 What Nolan doesn't know about humanity

 Tired of 'mind blowing' endings

 Inception: THE NIGHTMARE

 an intellectual challenging movie for people, who can't speak in relative clauses.

 Totally simple story for an idiot dressed up with special effects and nothing more

 i had to review this film

 Not as clever as it likes to think

 So bad

 The Emperors New Clothes
