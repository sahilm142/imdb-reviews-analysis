 I was deceived by this films high ratings.

 WARNING: Failed Attempt at Art to be Worshipped by Sheep

 The Emperor's New Clothes

 Where's the Plot?

 There Will Be....Nothing

 I want my 2.5 hours back!

 Worst Ever

 Horrible, even if you love the Directors previous films.

 Pretentious, Overracted, and down right boring ****spoilers****

 There will be blood... eventually

 There will be no point.

 Incredibly well-acted waste of time

 Admired by the feeble minded, hyped by the spineless

 There will be ham

 Wasted 3 hours, why not waste some more time for an IMDb comment?

 A Sad misfire for an otherwise talented group...

 Unbelievably Bad

 Worst movie

 Awful

 There will be something better than this

 So very Plain

 Extremely well made BAD film

 Are you kidding me?!

 Well crafted movie with no plot. The lead character is a one dimensional evildoer who simply gets worse and worse

 Yawn... yawn... yawn... yawn...
