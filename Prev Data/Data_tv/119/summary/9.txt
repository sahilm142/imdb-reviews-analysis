 These plot lines are terrible!

 "Who" Does It Better!

 The 9 is for Season 1 till 10, season 11 is a disappointment

 Doctor Who (Classic and New)

 The Third Season

 After Season 4..

 The Bitter with the Sweet

 The Whoniverse is a truly special film-universe. (The Doctor Who review)

 I love this show!

 Everywhere in time and space

 Why Doctor Who appeals to me

 watching Dr. who fast and in a amazing way with enjoyment in every episode

 The only series I watch real time

 Steven Moffat is not helping Doctor Who.

 Mind Bending Sci Fi Entertainment

 Still is good, but used to be Awesome.

 I liked it
