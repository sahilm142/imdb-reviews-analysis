 Ambitious nonsense

 Not for me very poor

 Sci Fi for dummies.

 In one word C.R.A.P

 This space opera sucks harder than a black hole

 what is it about? Aliens or pirates

 Very poor

 Poor acting, crummy script, weak CGI and just plain naff.

 One of the worst and most boring SciFi series ever !!!!!!!!

 High expectations -- low results

 Am I missing something?

 Up to season 3 and still looks just as unmemorable

 Just couldn't get into it

 More 'classic sci-fi' with classic issues
