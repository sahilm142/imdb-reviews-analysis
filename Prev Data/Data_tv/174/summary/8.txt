 Weak Pilot, But Stick Around...

 Great Series

 When BoJack Horseman Does Its Own Thing, BoJack Horseman Does it Well.

 Very entertaining and funny if you give it a chance.

 PopCultureThoughts.Com (Season 5)

 Fantastic writing.

 Just really my kind of humor

 Good Horseman

 Often offensive...but clever

 A Question

 Another great season

 Motivational

 Incongruous combination of colorful visuals and dark subject matter

 Season 4 - Pop Culture Thoughts

 Love it

 Has some truly golden moments, But slow at times.

 good cartoon
