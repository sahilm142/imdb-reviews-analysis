 Bogart, the hero who was exactly right for his time<U+0085>

 A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Humphrey Bogart makes his highly deserved tryst with super-stardom in John Huston's directorial debut

 The Fat Man Cometh

 Noir at its best

 "The Greatest Movie Star of all time" and more

 A great, smart noir whose pace covers the plot holes and is based on some great performances

 Top notch mystery that kicked off the film noir genre of the 1940s

 "I Won't Play The Sap For You."

 One of the Most Entertaining Films of Its Kind

 Bogie Tracks The Black Bird!

 A classic with good reason

 The best detective story.

 Entertainment defined

 Absorbing and worthy suspense film about blackmails , killings , corruption and strong intrigue

 The Mystical Narrator

 Detachment as Aura...and the way they talk!

 Your Move!!!

 LEGENDARY and UNPARALLELED Indeed!

 "For twenty years, I will wait for you. If they hang you, I will always remember you."

 Meh.

 Bogart makes it watchable.

 The 1931 original is a better movie and got the shaft

 Classic film-Noir, mysterious and interesting, but fails to deliver a solid climax.

 Film Noir At Its Best

 Deserving of its iconic status
