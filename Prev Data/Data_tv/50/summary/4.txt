 I used to love this. Kevin should be here

 Needs to end

 Way too unrealistic

 Should have ended in Season 5

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMERICA!

 Stop watching after season 4

 Disappointing, predictable and occasionally well acted

 House of Cards Must Collapse

 How bad is Series 6!!??

 Everything's except for the last season

 Was never going to work but not too bad

 The show is really bad. I am puzzled at all the good reviews.

 Stop after season two

 Season 5 turned into a bad soap opera

 Became too annoying

 Wanna know how it ends?

 Acting is great. Story is unbelievable.

 Absolute travesty

 Started great but is dying the death of American TV

 Started really interesting, then...

 Hard to watch all of the backstabbing and underhanded payoffs!

 What a disappointing way to end....

 Why bother?

 Not entertaining - Netflix do better or I'm out!

 Decent... when David Fincher set the tone
