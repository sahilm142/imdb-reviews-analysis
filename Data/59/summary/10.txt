 This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave, brilliant and better than it has any right to be.

 A Summer Film That IS Even Better Than The Hype

 The amount of people that don't understand the movie is astonishing

 Epic conclusion to Marvel's first 10 years

 THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!

 Everything we could've hoped for

 ABOVE MY EXPECTATION.

 Don't Listen To These liars! This is movie of the year contender!

 Don't believe sad DC fanboys bad reviews.

 Didn't live up to the hype

 Mind blowing..

 GOOD ONE BUT WITH MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS

 Speechless!

 Avengers: Infinity War, the best movie since LOTR!!

 Absolute Perfection - Exceeds All Expectations and Blows You Away. Best Marvel Film Yet.

 BEST MOVIE EVER

 Best MCU movie by far

 A Decade of A Masterpiece_Breathtaking and Heartbreaking

 Unlike anything ever done in the history of cinema

 Amazing movie!

 Not Satisfied yet

 Sad but amazing

 Best to date

 I never lost interest

 This movie has everything
