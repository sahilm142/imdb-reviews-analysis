 The first of the 'canonical' Miyazaki films.

 A Miyazaki masterpiece

 Unlike anything you've seen

 No doubt it's a Miyazaki Classic!

 Short coment

 Great Animation with background

 a stunning, thought-provoking anime worth the name of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli

 One girl against two worlds colliding

 Another beautiful Miyazaki film

 Okay, See it. But Not 'Til You've Done This Homework

 Imaginative and wonderful

 A masterpiece in every way.

 A mystical, ancient story with a potent environmental message

 another great environment theme by Miyazaki

 I had never heard of this one, but it was worth my time for sure

 If she's so great, why can't she remember to wear underwear?

 A soaring effort

 Innovative movie and concepts for 1984
