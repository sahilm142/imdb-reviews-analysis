 War has never been so much fun

 Business is a-Boomin'

 World War II In an Alternate Universe

 Unexpected, But Fantastic

 Major surprise

 Not for everyone...but if you like this sort of thing, watch it--it is a lot of fun.

 I sure would like to take Tarantino's history class

 A very watchable fairy tale

 That's a bingo

 Insane and yet hilarious - definitely worth a watch.

 "...I think this might be my masterpiece"

 Take an eye for an eye and everybody will be blind eventually

 A welcome return to form after 15 years

 Tarantino is back in form...

 A Nutshell Review: Inglourious Basterds

 Wer oder was ist ein gefreiter Butz? Great!

 A new twist on escapism

 This film takes place during World War II, in France while it is occupied by Nazi's (IMBD, 2009).

 Spoiler Alert.
