I absolutely hated this movie.Mild spoiler belowI have never seen so much shouting and screaming in my life. Every character is very, very serious and has to yell and scream and throw a mini-tantrum every scene. Watch the employee GET FIRED. Oh wait, let's hire him back. Oh let's FIRE the employee. Oh wait, let's hire him back. Oh let's FIRE the yaaawwwn.All the actors are very, very serious because you know how serious it is to produce a network TV show. Such mellodrama. They are acting like it is the ER and the president is getting shot.They every character has a rambling speech that goes on and on and on and on. Very serious stuff. You can tell because they have those lines in their foreheads when they speak.More yelling. More screaming. Life or death. About a news program for God's sake.There is has never been a film made with less subtlety. No subtlety at all. Just screaming, yetlling and overacting.Just horrendous, horrendous acting. How did it get all those Oscars? Because Hollywood loves movies about themselves. See Shakespeare in Love for example.It was pure agony to finish this movie. I had to break it up into four parts. I give it 2 stars because I wanted to see how they were going to end it. The whole seemed pointless.I have never disagreed with so many reviewers in my life. I suspect it is because a lot of people saw it back in the day. Old movies have a positive bias I noticed. Most don't hold up that well. I just saw Patton yesterday and I give that a 10. This one does not stand the test of time. By the way, I was 9 when this was released so I am old too.My overwhelming emotion in watching this movie is I wanted to tell all these actors and actresses to sit down and shut the hell up.
