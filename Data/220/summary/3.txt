 The most overrated movie of all time

 Boring, Boring, Boring and just odd.

 i have no idea why this is called a classic.

 Hate me if you want but I didn't like this film

 While not intentional,a film's whose effects ended up being irresponsible

 Eh....it was alright.

 I can't believe the script was made into a movie...

 Rock(y) bottom
