 Beginnnig of the end

 Clarkson, Hammond and May are what made it great.

 Used to be fab, now rubbish

 The new topgear is rubbish

 Bring back The Three Musketeers. Clarkson, May, and Hammond.

 the new one is just bad in every way

 Lamborghinis and loathing for rich boys..................

 BEWARE--An unfortunate end to a truly iconic franchise

 I would like this show if it wasn't for Jeremy Clarkson
