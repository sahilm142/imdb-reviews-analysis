 Could have been, but in the end it isn't

 We need more like this.

 I don't understand all of the criticism.

 Plots and Trope

 Great Show Beware of Extreme Political Bias

 Aaron Sorkin shows us, once again, a world a little better than our own<U+0085>

 A funny and intelligent show with great characters, with wide appeal

 Great but could have been better

 Enjoyed, But Disappointed

 Good, could be better

 Good portrayal of a media house, with praise-worthy performances

 please watch the "show" and not just "the news" on the show

 An ode to righteousness

 Fundamentally flawed, but very entertaining

 A great series, long may it continue.
