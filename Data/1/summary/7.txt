 Mystery

 Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .

 Relentless Storytelling

 Highly Overrated But Still Good

 Over Rated

 A Bit Over-Rated Perhaps, But Still A Good Movie With Great Performances From Freeman and Robbins

 A very good film, but it's not Papillon

 Easy-breezy, obvious as a child's lie.

 What's SO special?

 2nd best film ever?

 Stephen King's prison tale with a happy ending...

 Sure it's good, but no. 2 of all time???

 Very good, but probably over-praised

 Why? Why? Why?

 Worth watching, but not extraordinary

 Good but not great

 A cute and sentimental prison drama?

 A heroic fable, but nothing more.

 good one but not the "second best of all time"...

 Good acting, average story

 A fantasy indeed.

 "There's something inside they can't touch."

 Great film, a bit over rated

 So so.. recals so m

 The best movie ever?
