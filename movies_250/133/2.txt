I felt really sad as this is supposed to be on the highlights of Turkish cinema. I understand every country has its own ways of making movies, own accents and they can be different than the standard American way. The acting is very childish and amateuristic. The overall feeling is over-sentimental and pathetic. The plot of the movie is interesting, universal and something everybody can relate to but the execution is very poor. At the moment of writing this movie is at place 132 in the top 250 and I consider it not to be in its place at all. Unfortunately this is very mediocre cinema, interesting to see out of cultural interest.
