 Should be called "The Retarded"

 don't believe the hype

 Just An Ugly Film

 I couldn't believe this film won best picture...

 Just didn't get it

 Yet another grossly inflated piece of directorial and actors' self-indulgence

 It is just a bad terrible Hollywood copy of IA.

 F***ing s***, this won the f***ing Academy f***ing awards??!??

 The Disappointed

 Depart before this movie starts.

 humm, what the hell

 what is this mess?

 Terrible Film, simply awful

 Horrible

 It's New England, it's the Mafia, of course it's Scorsese how 'bout them apples, right Matt.

 Definitely not as good as the original Hong Kong film

 Good but it's being over-rated

 Disappointed

 Great plot line, but got ruined fast (maybe spoilers)

 Don't understand the hype

 Bloated, overlong, overrated

 The Departed - hard to like.

 Watch the original before this one

 would be OK if it were not a remake - just my personal opinion

 " and they all died..."
