 No spoilers here because Westworld lost the plot.

 Really disappointing Season 2

 "Lost" all over again!!

 Season Two - I am Lost.

 HBO Fails in season 2 , Not much like season 1

 Literally fell asleep during S2 E2

 Didn't do it for me

 Season One was Brilliant. Season 2 (7 episodes in so far) is Awful. Cancelled My HBO.

 Wabling

 Feminist Revenge Fantasy Can't Redeem Bloviating Robo-Myth

 Very good first season. Very bad second season

 Well made but deeply dislikeable

 Flow and Scientific quality

 1st Season ok; 2nd Season mindless violence; stopped watching

 Technically Beautiful Trash

 Season 1 is worth watching- Season 2 is awful

 Empty and Exasperating

 Turning into walking dead

 Well, it was interesting....

 The Eye of the Hurricane of Pretension

 Awesome concept... silly plot line

 Great Season 1 but.....

 Unfortunately - easily forgettable

 TOO INTELLECTUAL, LACKS NARRATIVE DRIVE

 Very over hyped,and overrated
