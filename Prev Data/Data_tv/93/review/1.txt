I first saw the trailer of the show online after school one day,and when I watched the first episode of the show,I really liked it and saw great potential.But after watching the rest of the episodes and seeing all of the controversies about the show not being back on Saturday mornings,and then the show being cancelled and people saying that Young Justice is the best superhero animated show ever after 46 episodes,I gave up on liking the show because it now feels too overrated to me.
