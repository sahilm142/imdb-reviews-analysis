This is an absolutely horrific excuse for a TV program. I remember being forced to watch this for my religious education classes in school, but I never remember it being this awful. All of the characters are imbosiles that cannot act, aren't funny and have no reason to be on national television. The writing of this show is so disgustingly bad that I would honestly rather watch static. I will never know, until the day I die why this terrible excuse for a show was so popular in Britain. I'm sure that 10 seconds prior to the pilot being aired th average IQ dropped 30 points. That really is the only reason I can think of that anyone would find this funny. For the love of God don't watch it, go outside and smash rocks together but don't watch Father Ted.
