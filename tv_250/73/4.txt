I can't for the life of me understand the appeal of this skit comedy show. Chappelle is an okay comedian who occasionally make me laugh hard, but the yuks are mostly wanting in this particular program. The worst skit is ironically the most popular: "The Rick James Story." Chappelle looks and sounds nothing like Rick James, and his catchphrase has become overused ad nauseum in the real world. Other unfunny skits include the crack addict, Popcopy and the racist TV animals. This is not to say the show is a total loss. Paul Mooney's "Negrodamus" monologues are pretty funny, and I sort of liked that "blind, black KKK member" skit. One inspired bit was having the vanilla Steve Harvey play some creepy crook. For the most part, "Chappelle's Show" is a below-average skit comedy with some inspired moments. I will say that it is far superior to other swill that Comedy Central sees fit to broadcast, such as Adam Carolla's talk show, The Man Show, Crossballs, and the worst of the bunch, reruns of the putrid MAD TV.Paul Mooney, one of the writers, has done better work on the excellent skit comedy show "In Living Color." He should write for and bring his "Negrodamus" skit to "Saturday Night Live." I'd watch it then.
