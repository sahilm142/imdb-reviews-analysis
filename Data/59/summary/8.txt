 Very good but get rid of that unnecessary humor for god's sake

 Competent directing style creates a strong balancing act that pays off well

 Marvel scores again

 Detailed storytelling, well realised characters and a compelling villain.

 Great movie not a great ending...

 Thanos was the star of the show

 The Villain makes the movie work

 Taking the genre to the next level

 Lot of stuff!!!!

 Rating: A-

 Good movie, but not that great to be on the list of IMDB 250

 Avengers...Assemble?

 Expectations were met.

 That ending...

 So much to pack into 1 film - should Infinity Wars have been a trilogy?

 The Ultimate Popcorn Movie

 Cuthroat, brutal, and fun as hell

 watch out

 Terrible and Overated

 It Feels Like a Real Comic Book Movie

 A film that exhilarates and cheats you at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes

 I cried for an hour after.

 Spoilers: Seems to be setting up a major cheat

 Great movie.

 Visually Stunning
