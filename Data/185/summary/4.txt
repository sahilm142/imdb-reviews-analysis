 With Self-Righteousness into the Grave

 Profoundly Boring and Pretentious

 Another boring pretentious counter culture movie

 Suburban white male hates his parents

 Movies that are absolutely in love with themselves are always their own downfall.

 The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com

 An Unlovable Character

 Very boring, he is NOT a hero at all,he died for nothing, period.

 mostly conjecture

 How the hipsters would like to view reality Or What is a martyr for some people, is a Darwin-Award-winner for others

 Life is Not......Like This

 Lacking in originality

 Into the Wild-out of my life

 Hated

 Stupid story. Good acting.

 Possible Spoilers: Cold-Hearted Me

 A bratty kid decides reject society and rough it in the wild

 As boring as it gets

 Not top bad

 Beautiful marriage of image and music is greatly lessened by central character who is impossible to admire (SPOILERS)

 I want those 2+ hours back

 Selfish act of an adolescent

 Fabulous Story Ruined by Hollywood

 Penn and Pearl Jam on Tour
