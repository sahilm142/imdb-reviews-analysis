 Summed up in one word....terrible

 Only for men?

 The ugly, trashy stepbrother of 'Rome' and 'I, Claudius'

 Good quality ? yeah right maybe On syfy network

 Simplistic show for violence-lovers

 Unbearably bad

 Very Disappointing Garbage-Watched 1 Episode, won't watch more

 Over the top

 I think this is done...and thank goodness.

 Too many scenes with computer graphics for the background

 Too much nudity and sex scenes

 God awful!
