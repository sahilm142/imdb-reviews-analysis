 Sorry, but it just didn't deliver

 "It had nothing to do with business"

 A decent follow-up but not great as far as I'm concerned

 great

 Just give Coppola the Nobel Prize!

 Oh, Those Corleones....

 Excellent continuation of the classic saga

 Good screenplay

 Bloated, overrated uneven nonsense

 perfect !!!

 awesome casting

 Nice move

 God Father

 Revisited

 Some touching moments, some over the top

 Not quite up to the first Godfather film--but chilling enough...

 Great performances from De Niro and Pacino but oh so slow

 Tagline: "In case you didn't get it the first time."

 The ongoing story of Michael Corleone is mostly one-note drama while the story of young Vito is compelling

 (Spoilersreview!) Sure it's great, but seriously? How snobby can a fan base be? (Spoilers)

 A disappointing continuation.

 Good

 Al Capone, the new Godfather

 Great story...
