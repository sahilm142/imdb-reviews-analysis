 Classy South Korean Erotic Thriller Divided in Three Parts

 A very refined and directed movie

 You gotta hand it to Park Chan-wook

 will need a 2nd viewing. I mean that as a compliment (mostly)

 A suspense thrill of twist and turns that questions trust, it's a double cross fueled by hot erotic passion and unexpected emotions.

 The Handmaiden is an excellent erotic psychological thriller with twisty screenplay,terrific direction and performances.

 "Mesmerizing" tale of beauty and obsession that succeeds on all fronts

 a stunning piece of art

 a none-too-novel plotting and scheming pulp sustained with an absolutely captivating momentum

 Park Chan-Wook needs to make more movies.

 Darkly beautiful? Needlessly explicit lesboerotica? Both?

 Direction at its best.

 A superbly made soap opera

 Intimate - Beautiful - Quietly Powerful

 Smart, enthralling and theatre-like; but a bit too dense

 The Handmaiden is extremely artful pulp

 The chime of the bells

 Much better than expected

 It's the best film of the year 2017.

 What Tangled Webs We Weave

 In the circle of romance, deceive and defraud.

 An intriguing and visually and intellectually literate film

 Catch Me If You Can
