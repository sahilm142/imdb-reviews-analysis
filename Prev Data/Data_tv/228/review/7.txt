Actually more miss than hit. Unfortunately! Having watched season 1 and 2 there are only three good episodes: 'Sardines', 'A quiet night in' and 'The 12 days of Christine', you can safely miss the others as the writers are trying too hard to be funny or come up with a surprising twist, that in my opinion mostly just fizzles out in the end. Not sure I will want to watch any more...
