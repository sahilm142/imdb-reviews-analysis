City Lights held my attention, it's by no means profound. Somewhat feeble and childish in many ways.Is it forbidden to write something negative about this film? Seems like it. The characters have very little to offer and Charlie is all over the place. The ending is unresolved as Charlie is where he begun. The comedy is hit and miss, though the segment in the boxing ring is all laughs.
