really boring jokes. same old lame expressions. dialogs very unrealistic. dumb useless pretentious English conversations especially in season 2. introduced new characters and relationships just to waste time. I'm very disappointed from TVF. they really started something with their "QTIYAPA" and "THE MAKING OF", these shows were very creative and genuinely funny. but, now they are back to the same old lame comedy, which general Indians are addicted to. season 1 may be tolerated (inspite of having some boring scenes taken directly from dull romantic movies); but, season 2 is outrageous, its forcibly made into lengthy episodes. i was feeling as if i'm watching an "EKTA KAPOOR" serial, same family drama, same illogical family fights. i wouldn't recommend it.
