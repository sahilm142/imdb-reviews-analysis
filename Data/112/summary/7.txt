 Indiana Jones and the Welcome Return to Form

 He didn't have a ticket

 Fun action and witty dialogue abound...

 It should have remained the last

 This is why we go to the movies...amazing scenes of action and adventure on grand scale...

 Great indie film!

 Refreshing and uplifting yarn which goes above and beyond what is expected of it; a fine effort that hits all the marks for which it aims.

 Globe trotting adventure classic

 Not as wonderful as the first two, but still enjoyable.

 Good Adventure Sequel!

 The World's Most Fearless Adventurer Returns

 Well it is worth Watching

 A classic, with two veteran stars

 Great duo of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery

 The (Not Quite) Last Crusade

 Entertaining But Badly Paced

 Keep Up with the Jonses

 The Indy Trilogy Ends Strong

 Good

 A bit controversial.....

 Funny!

 Silly, but fun all the same

 when compared to Raiders this movie is quite average

 Lighthearted and warm, but lacklustre. The worst of the original trilogy !!
