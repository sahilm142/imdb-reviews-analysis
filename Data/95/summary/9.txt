 Dark but Funny Comic Fantasy

 A Comedy Of Horrors

 Quentin Tarantino is a Crazy Basterd

 dialogue language visuals homage to cinema

 Not for critics, but people who love a good movie

 Larger than life in the best cinematic ways

 Tarantino's Glorious Return

 Where do I sign up?

 Inglourious Basterds

 His Best since Pulp Fiction? (Yes)

 A film that pretends to be thoughtful, and turns out to be disappointing.

 Just brilliant

 QT has done it again

 Not a fan of Tarantino, but I can't argue with this!

 I'd like a glass of milk or whatever the heck Martin Wuttke was on

 Golden Acting from Waltz!

 This movie made my day

 "One hundred Nazi scalps!"

 You just say bingo.

 A total shock, amazing movie

 Dialogue and Waltz are genius.

 This just might be Tarantino's masterpiece

 A wealth of almost-themes and lush production values, amazing cast, a must-see

 In a word, fun

 I think it might be his best work yet!
