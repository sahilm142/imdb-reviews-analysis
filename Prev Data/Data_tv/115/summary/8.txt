 A Serious Show for a Serious Audience.........

 Painfully great fun!

 Political correctness was not yet in style...

 some thoughts on the people reviewing this show...

 Premiere Episode

 Boring

 Mundane, yet somehow brilliant

 Not what it seemed to be

 Great series! Sad to see it wrapping up.

 Watch That Continuity!!

 Excellent depiction of the sixties and seventies workplace

 An obviously misunderstood show by many.

 Begrudgingly Lov-ed

 Classic (look back)

 Good show about the "old days"

 Mad Men is addicting, enjoyable, and intriguing

 Am I watching the same show as all of you?

 best drama for years

 The Ugly American

 Pretty brilliant show

 justice is inevitable

 This is why TV is better than many movies out there

 Very good show that got to play out the story

 If you want to see how Hollywood liberals treat women and view society, this is your show!
