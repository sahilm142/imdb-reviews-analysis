 Extrmely long and boring

 Disjointed, horribly directed waste of time

 Vastly overrated - totally inferior to The Searchers

 Long and VERY boring! did I say it was also boring and very long?

 Tedious, drawn out boredom.

 Forget this one and ride on!

 Rather than a genre, western is a style: an USA one

 One of the worst movies I've ever seen

 Bad doesn't begin to describe it

 Boring.

 The Good, the Bad & the Absolutely Ridiculous.
