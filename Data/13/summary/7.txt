 An Original Blockbuster

 nice

 Not all that bad

 Darth Vader Strikes Back.

 Overrated, but a good film, especially the first time.

 The Empire Strikes Out

 LemonKnight: The Empire Strikes Back Review

 The science fiction franchise of a century.

 7.4/10 Easily Irvin Keshner's best film, even if it isn't as good as the original, or as innovative

 7 - Good

 And it strikes back with a bang

 Thrilling, but it needs to dig deeper into the idea of the Force.

 Good

 Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back

 Very good

 Star Wars V

 Action, Adventure, But Lack Of "Epic"

 Fun--But Much Better When I was a Kid

 Entertaining

 Great!

 was OK but wasn't the best star wars film

 Entertaining Adventure, Not to Be Taken Too Seriously

 mature sci-fi

 honest account

 just barely below the first one
