 Best new Disney show!!

 Surprisingly funny.

 intriguing

 How gravity falls proved to me that watching a show as it airs will make it more enjoyable

 I am honestly surprised

 Good "only second season animation".

 This is one of the best Disney cartoons of modern times

 Now I can say I have watched all episodes of Gravity Falls

 Another good show for all ages!
