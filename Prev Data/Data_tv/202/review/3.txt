Ash VS Evil Dead, 2015 *Spoiler/plot- A ten years later, update of Ash in his life that gets interrupted by the Evil Dead from an accidental reciting a passage from the 'Book of the Dead'.*Special Stars- Bruce Campbel, Ray Santiago, Dana DeLorenzo, Jill Marie Jones, Lucy Lawless.*Theme- TV cable Comedy series. Never play around with the dark forces of the dead. *Trivia/location/goofs- More of the same from Bruce Campbel.*Emotion- Kidda predictable and boring up-dated version of the landmark film series of classic horror made decades ago. Very clichéd with no new surprises or techniques and very tough to watch again, especially for those fans of the classic horror franchise. *Based On- Bruce Campbel's 'Evil Dead' film series.
