 Atrocious acting, preposterous plot, sadly not a joke

 Ab-ra-cadaver

 This movie is an insult to your IQ

 Dark, depressing, plodding, ponderous, and unbelievably dull

 Predictable and Contrived

 One of the Worst movies I've ever seen!!!

 Boring

 "The Prestige" is lacking it

 One of the worst movies ever

 No-go

 Let's watch middle-aged men talk for 2 hours! That sounds SO fun!

 Two magician pals become rivals after one of their performances turns tragic

 What A Dark, Dreary and Dopey Story!

 I was wondering when it would end!

 life-ruining bad

 A Hollywood Committee Picture!!!

 Highly overrated...

 The Prestige- Don't Need this Type of Honor 1/2*

 Most confusing movie!

 Very bad and boring...

 No, I don't understand the plot, and I don't care

 terrible

 Good Movie, but a Let Down

 Worst script ever!

 The drowning of imagination
