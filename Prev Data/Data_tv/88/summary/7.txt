 It was a great and creative production except they didn't know where or how to end.

 Overlong and exciting series full of mystery , thrills , suspense and paranormal phenomenon

 Good movie...

 X-Files started as a fun and excited series, and ended as a boring radio show

 Not really scifi. not really horror, not really mystery...

 Love the standalones - HATE the mythology!

 Rushed---- Anderson stunning - Duchovny dodgy.

 "What you don't see is actually scarier than what you do see" - Chris Carter

 7 Stars so far from a serioues fan

 Pretty decent show, except Mulder and Scully can act like lifeless at times

 A great show that simply fizzled out

 A good show that went down badly

 Cutting edge...

 Reboot of the famous 90s series

 You'd need to have seen up to the end of series 5
