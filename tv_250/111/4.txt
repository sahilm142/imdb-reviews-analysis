OK i really like this but am scared you guy are not digging deep enough, you guys content is nice , but all i see is usual like other movies , series , think out the box guys , you've got great content but you guys have room for improvement. since its a rap thing you guys are putting to us, go into what rappers do, their life style, study successful rappers from way back. let me give you guys a clue 1.i have watched 5 episodes with no rap battle yet, there's still room fir that am sure guys2. rappers have friends constantly been killed nothing yet on thati thing about 12 things that's have not seen yet that's constant with rap you guys can improve am sureRegards
