 Completely overrated rubbish

 Inconceivable! I can't believe I just used that joke.

 Perhaps the most overrated movie of all time

 inconceivable that it is rated as high as it is.

 Terrible

 a blend of blandness and bloodiness

 It brought a smile to my face....WHEN THE CREDITS BEGAN TO ROLL!!!

 Sexist pile of garbage

 The princess bride is to fantasy is as Chucky is to horror.

 My six year old puts on better shows than this in the back yard.

 A Load of Puke Bile

 This Film Could've Been Better

 Why is this on the top 250 list?

 most over-rated piece of filth ever made

 Inconceivable!!!

 Maybe I am just too old and cynical for it

 Linear, banal, devoid of wit, facile, simpering and dull - dull - dull
