 Fin Hammatt kill bill Vol 1 review

 Well made action film

 Horrible

 Fast, brutal, and stylish. Quentin's back.

 Sexiest killer ever!

 A very good movie, a very shameless release

 Fine action flick

 Kill Bill is the reason we go to the movies

 It is not for the faint hearted but is definitely for anyone who likes something a little different and enjoys the oriental culture and quirkiness that this film has.

 As Time Goes on, I Dislike it More and More...

 Kill Bill: Vol. 1

 Bloody awesome murder.

 Tarantino's genre film

 Overly Violent, Overly Simplified Martial Arts Takeoff

 Awesome

 One of 2003's Best

 Unrealistic and dynamic

 Stylish AF

 love it

 Style, Elegance and Excellence On 35mm Film

 Classic modern style of action...

 Thrilling........

 A sadistic thriller which tells the tale of sweet revenge.

 Now that I think about it...

 Crisp and clear, almost like plastic
