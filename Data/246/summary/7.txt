 This film is definitely not a wrong number!!! Aamir lived the role of PK

 Good But Not Enough

 Aamir Khan excels once again in a decent film

 Don't go see this Bollywood Movie ("PK") <U+0085>

 An Alien love triangle which gives religion a revision

 P.K. is OK!

 Dhoom 3 Disaster compensated, Far better than Kick and HNY

 Great concept, poor acting

 flop movie dissastrous logics

 'Pk' a hilarious and entertaining movie........

 Honest, no BS review

 Emotional and funny at the same time....!

 Acting was exceptional but the movie is a little overrated

 Disappointed with high expectations.. Entertaining though

 Satire presented in amusing manner but has a stretched second half!

 Now that's a blockbuster!

 PK - If this were to be released before OMG, would be outstanding!

 A great movie that talks about the society from a completely different point of view. Only Aamir Khan could play this role as well as he has.. A must watch for all.

 Story of a lost alien

 Pk teach us a good lesson

 Whats the fuss all about ??

 Another Best Movie of Amir Khan, full of comedy & Reality

 Too good to be true

 Great movie that tries to be a jack of all trades

 Very funny.
