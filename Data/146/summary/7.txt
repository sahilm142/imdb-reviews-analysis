 Excellent performances; so-so story

 A Classic

 Brando's Best

 Brando is close to perfection.

 "This city's full of hawks... "

 Powerful, gutsy drama about a longshoreman with a conscience...

 On the Waterfront

 A stand out film for Marlon Brando

 Overcoming The Idiot Plot

 Not the most compelling film ever, but a well-acted melodrama

 So much psychological leakage...

 In my opinion, it's overrated

 Then There's Brando

 Great acting makes it all worthwhile

 Could have been better

 Bravura acting performances, Cartoonish plot/Characters

 One of the best films from the 50s
