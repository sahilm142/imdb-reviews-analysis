A show made by morons, about morons, for morons only. But then I should have known that going in once I saw Apatow's name on it, the undisputed king of the moron movie. Not there's anything wrong with that. I mean I love the 3 stooges, but they can be funny, whereas there is no one on this show who is even remotely amusing. I mean I doubt they could have found a less talented bunch of actors. Even the 'adults' are pathetically unfunny. All i can say is thank goodness it didn't survive. By the end of the show I wanted to nuke everyone on the set. The odd thing is this is such a bad show, I'm amazed they haven't tried to revive it. I can only hope that is a special place in hell for Apatow.
