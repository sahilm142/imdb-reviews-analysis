 A fascinating look at life in the big city

 Incredible Look; Incredible Plot

 Sex...drugs...and dodgy Irish accents but oh well!

 Strong 8 - Really great! Not quite as legendary as I hoped, but still strong.

 Corruption, betrayal, and scandal. But a fight for purity and Kim Basinger giving the best performance of her career support claim to the best film of 1997 and perhaps the 90's decade.

 Brilliant, powerful, gripping

 It was good, but it's two points under "great"

 One of the Best Crime Films of the 90's. A classic Action Drama!

 A cop drama that doesn't rely on car chases?!?!

 Almost as good as Chinatown

 Entertaining mystery film

 come to los angeles..

 INTRIGUING FILM NOIR

 better than the book

 Kim Basinger was really sexy!

 Confidentially: Could have been MUCH Better

 Fantastic film-noir

 I'm glad i don't live in the 60's

 Classy film noire thriller with atmosphere

 Truly Brilliant (spoilers inside)

 Hard to follow, Basinger is not worthy of Best S.A, the three male leads are incredible, overall a pretty good film

 Okay i guess

 A Very Uneven Film, though it holds your attention through the rough moments

 Not as masterful as everyone says
