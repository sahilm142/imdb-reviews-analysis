 A Stylish, Uniquely Twisted Period Piece

 Storytelling at its best!

 Imaginative and intriguing crash of wits between two famous magicians

 A little confusing, but excellent performances make for an otherwise great all-around film

 Another Magical Work by Nolan.

 The movie is about more than the trick

 The importance of secrecy. Never think that spies are the best!

 One of the best movies I've seen this year...

 Mystifying modern film-making at it's very best!

 Clever, labrynthian mystery-thriller - with David Bowie!

 Sinister sleight of hand

 The Most Original Movie In Recent Years

 Epic Tale About Tricksters

 Very Well Made Magic Tale

 Are you watching closely?

 Entertaining drama

 Syncing Thriller Beats To Mastery

 The awesome hidden truth!

 Great acting and a twisty story about magicians from Christopher Nolan

 Abracadabra.

 Well put together -- but not your happy place!

 Nolan does it again

 Dark, moody, but fun!!!
