 Even Hansel and Gretel arrived somewhere following the crumbles.

 Season 2 Does Not Carry the Torch

 True Disappointment

 High hopes dashed

 promised so much and let down

 True detective season 2

 The Dumbing & Numbing of America

 Season 3 ridiculous ending.

 Not as good as first series

 Season 3 - real miss

 Unoriginal, chauvinistic

 So slow !

 Disappointed to say the least!

 Unpopular opinion!

 Dissapointing

 Quick wrap up - 1 Season 5 star, Second season 0

 It just did not hook me

 great cast but awful story

 About as exciting as watching paint dry

 Slow

 Too dark and slow for me. GREAT ACTING (Season 1) but I'd rather watch Dexter.

 Grim

 Awful
