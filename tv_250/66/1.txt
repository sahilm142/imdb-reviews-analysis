I tried watching 2 episodes of this show from start to end. It was amazingly boring and when I tried following the story I found my self just looking at the people talking without paying attention to the plot and what's going on.


                
Highly unrealistic Utopian White house with only angels living in it... 
No real plot or story. Stop watching after 6 episodes.


                
Basically liberals watched this show for 7 years and pretended Martin Sheen was the president instead of George W. Bush.


                
Chock full of liberal talking points where conservatives are shown as idiots and war mongers
