 I felt unsatisfied and cheated . . this is not for which we waited for 10 years

 Utter Gibberish.

 Absolutely dreadful - If you love the books, don't watch it

 Should have done much better, an insult to Rowling and the fans!

 It's not Harry Potter but Cool Witch action movie

 Why Yates Why!!!!!

 The worst climax ever put to film

 An extremely cliché end for a part of the childhood of millions

 Just a poor excuse for a Harry Potter adaption

 Harry Potter Part 2 is Deathly Boring

 Much ado about nothing

 overrated: the only good part of the movie is the severus memories

 Complete disgrace

 This is so bad

 Massively Moronic Money Making Mess
