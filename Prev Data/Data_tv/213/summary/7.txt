 Weaker than Narcos by 2 stars

 Missing a good vilan character .

 Good but kinda underwhelming

 I love Michael Peña, but he is seriously mis-cast in this series and role

 Good, But definitely not the best of the series

 A worthy Narcos season that picks up slow but gets running halfway through

 Don't expect much

 Tell it like it is

 Not enough english

 not as good as the previous ones

 Less glamorous, more realistic, do see!
