 An Alternative To Popular Opinion..Read On If You Dare!!!

 Winter is Coming, at the Pace of a Glacier

 Could have been so great...

 I really liked GOT till Season 7

 Meh

 Mix of good and bad

 A medieval soap

 How can the source material turn into... This...

 Season 7 is a Big Disappointment.

 I don't get it

 Mindless violence and misplaced nudity

 Anticpating "The Dragon & the Wolf"

 Good visuals, actors and atmosphere, but...

 Wanted this to be a gem, all I got was soft porn.

 Last Two Seasons are comically bad

 I think GoT has run out of steam :( oh well

 Unpopular Opinion

 Glossy, spectacular, but what about involving the viewer?

 Beginners mistakes

 Disappointed

 The hype has been over done
