 Compelling, far superior sequel to sci-fi classic (8/10)

 Awesome second installment to Alien saga filled with tension , chills , noisy action and groundbreaking scenes

 The good kind of escapism

 Great!

 Aliens (Special Edition) **** (8/10)

 Aliens Floats To The Top of the Sequels

 James Cameron's Powerhouse Sequel to "Alien"

 Wow!

 By Far The Best Movie In The Franchise

 No, It Doesn't Match the Original, So Stop Pretending

 One of the greatest sci-fi action films ever made .....

 Tons of action and tons of aliens...

 Brilliant film-making

 Great SF action, but not in the same league as Alien

 Aliens is a good action film but not as great as Alien

 In my opinion, by far the best of the series

 Mostly Watch This Movie At Night, Mostly

 Aliens is good, Alien is better

 One Of The Biggest And Best Sequels Ever

 Great work

 Aliens(1986)

 Freakishly Good

 One of the best sequels in all of cinema

 Almost as great as the first film

 Bigger, Meaner, More Action-Packed. Aliens Is a Crude, but Bitchin' Sequel
