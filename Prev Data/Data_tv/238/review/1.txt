I often get a feeling nowadays that in the US people have really gone off their rocker. Have they really completely lost their touch with reality?
Beside the show being completely inane, it is written really poorly, like a teenager was trying to "make it" in a world of grown ups. There's no real direction, and the actors all seem to have been recruited out of a tenth-rate theatrical troupe.
I have no idea why anybody would want to watch more than 10 minutes of this drivel, let alone more than one episode. I sure couldn't.


                
Painful as in the acting is god awful. Could be a great show if there was actual talent. So disappointing.


                
I was looking forward to this as it seemed like fun. What a huge disappointment! They cannot act. It's just awful. Giving up after one episode.
