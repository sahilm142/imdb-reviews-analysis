 Overated

 I enjoyed moments of this film

 I did not like this movie, am I a gay iraqi communist?

 no no no no no

 Typical, manipulative, sentimental Spielberg.

 Painful to see talent go in the wrong direction

 Nothing new.

 Feeding the arrogance of the baby-boomer generation

 Good battle scenes, but plot is ridiculous and film is too long

 Horrible

 Seen it before.

 Cinematography the only redeeming thing

 I cannot see the appeal at all (probably due to personal bias)

 Overhyped, overrated, Hollywood trash.

 Weak

 Both Great and Overrated, at the Same Time

 Naïve vision of war

 Clichéd

 Effective but ultimately another exploitative piece from Spielberg

 Not realistic

 Shocking violence with a heavy dose of Speilberg oversentimentality.

 Amazing 30 minutes movie

 Disappointingly derivative

 Pure glurge

 Good, but by no means the greatest war movie ever (or even of the decade, or the year, for that matter)
