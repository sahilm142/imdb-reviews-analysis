When I first saw this show, I just zapped through the channels. The episode was probably half-way through, and first I thought it was a sort of documentary. My first impression was that it is horrible with these "reality" programs, just trying to obtain viewers by presenting ordinary people as idiots. The "sheriff" (can't remember his name) appearance, was the only reason I realized it was just a comedy. Brilliant entertainment. The atmosphere makes it very realistic and credible. Thankfully it is still being shown on Danish national television, I sure hope it continues. I have not seen many Canadian shows, but if this is the standard - bring them on!


                
This show will be a cult favorite, like another Canadian classic SCTV.  One day it will be showing on US cable and watch out this show will explode. Like the hosers on SCTV, this show pokes fun at Canadians in a backwards way.  Nice to see people laugh at themselves.  What makes this show funny, is some of these characters must result from real life experiences. Everyone either has a relative, friend, co-worker, like Ricky, Bubbles, Corry, Trevor, and J Rock.  J Rock the 29 year old, ridiculous looking White rapper wannabe, who lives with his mom.  Ricky, the trailer park idiot,(Will Farrel of the show) who provides 90% of the material, while living in a car missing a right door; and Corry with his pal Trevor the 2 slow witted wannnabes who end up holding the bag.  Living in East Kildonan this reminds me of my youth and shows how believable casting, and writing overcomes a lower budget.  What's next a show about Postal Workers.
