 Disappointing

 I'm Sad, Angry and Disgusted at this film.

 Boring and depressing, with a couple good laughs mixed in

 So sad it took me an entire day to get over it!

 OK story, damaged by reverse sexism

 Good presentation, bad storytelling.

 Mentally Challenging

 Completely average.

 decent story, otherwise blah

 Meh... Not their best.

 Great concept, lacking imagination and creativity.

 A list of emotions

 Pixar's Worst

 Original idea?

 Pixar goes for plastic

 Great potential, but wasn't entertained

 Lots of invention, lots of ideas but not enough direction

 Just a bunch of hype

 Disappointing!
