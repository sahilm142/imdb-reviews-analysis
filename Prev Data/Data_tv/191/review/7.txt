I have to disconnect a bit to truly enjoy this show because, if I don't, the unintentional comedy keeps getting in the way.My beefs:1) "Red, no blue...arrrgggghhh!"Any geek who has ever played an adventure game (from Zork to Grand Theft Auto) knows the routine. The plot is moved by a chain of quests and little else. I need to exit the dungeon, but I need a key. The wizard has the key, but to get it, I need the unicorn. To get the unicorn, I need to get the princess. To get the princess, I need to get the rose. To get the rose, I need to get the painting. ...and so on, ad nauseam...Once you pick up on that dynamic within this show, it becomes sort of laughable. Every time they encounter and interact with any external person or entity, they are left with a quest. Seriously. They could approach the local grocer to pick up a gallon of milk and, somehow, leave with no milk until a task to set up the grocer's son with a prom date is completed.This method is not unique to this show, so it is not a deal-breaker.2) "If it wasn't for bad luck..."Jack Bauer is the only dude I know that has more problems in a given day than Jax Teller and his pals. I understand why Bauer's day is so unfairly loaded with horrible circumstances - that's the premise of the show 24. With SoA, however, the sheer number of horrible events in a short period of time is, frankly, exhausting. It feels unnecessarily compressed. They finish up their Irish adventure, return home, immediately deal with the Kim Bauer, er (sorry!), Tara kidnapping situation and, whew, relax for 10 minutes. Enjoy it, cuz, tomorrow, you're all going to jail! Real humans saddled with such an utter concentration of tragedy would have an uncommon tendency to find out what the business end of a pistol tastes like. Just sayin'.I think the show's creators recognize this which is why they, very occasionally, show moments of levity or even (*gasp*) normality.3) "Imperial Stormtroopers meets the A-Team"This SAMCRO gang can do *nothing* right. Nothing. Even routine criminal activities reliably end in failure. They are the Gang That Can't Shoot Straight, yet almost always emerge unscathed. Handing off some scripts/drugs to a black market doctor? By all means, do it outside, in full view of the neo-Nazi guy! All the "bad guys" going to a rally? Simultaneously have your club show up with automatic weapons *AND* arrange for the cops to be at the scene! It is confounding. There is very little reason for me to believe this numbskull SAMCRO outfit would remain in business for more than a few weeks. I don't know who would pay them for "protection" or risk getting pinched buying guns or drugs from them.4) "Beefcake! BEEFCAAAAAAAAAAAKE!"I get it. Jax is "hot". My wife tells me so. Given we're watching the DVD release and there are no commercials, I actually appreciate the occasional Jax-shirtless-Diet-Pepsi-commercial thing - my cue to hit the kitchen. (Jax's accent - especially when he has to act alongside dudes with any accent native to the U.K. - drifts in and out, which is a riot.)We dudes are hosed, though. To paraphrase Cleavon Little's character from Blazing Saddles, "Where all the women at?" We got a fairly worn out Peg Bundy, a tramp-stamped doctor with more baggage than sense, prostitutes and porn stars, and psychotic lesbian federal agents. How about throwing us a hot chick with a head on her shoulders and, just for good measure, make her immune (if not hostile) to Jax's, um, "charms".I'll keep watching in spite of my sneaking suspicion that I have been Jerry MacGuire'd (tricked into watching a chick flick). The writing is pretty nimble - they haven't painted themselves into a corner quite yet. They have a sense of humor about themselves - I particularly enjoyed Jax telling the Porn Lady that he wasn't there to "Adriana her" (a reference to Jax's ex-wife's character on The Sopranos) and Gemma saying she'd rather go bald than red-head (Al Bundy is predictably indifferent on the subject). There are some fine moments with nice payoffs - even if you see them coming in advance to some degree.So, it's a video game in TV-show form and it will make your wife hot for scumbags. It is simply *loaded* with supporting characters from all over the entertainment spectrum (You will spend a fair amount of time wondering exactly from where you know Characters X and Y...and who knew there was a *low rent* version of Eric Roberts out there?). You know, you just haven't lived until you've seen Gerry Bertier empty a MAC-10 into the back of a chick's head. Strong side, left side, indeed.By all means, enjoy this show. I know I am. Just, please, please, spare Billy the posthumous gymnastics and refrain from the Shakespeare comparisons. It ain't that, at all. Also, spare us the indignation of decrying the "glorification" of the lifestyles portrayed. Those clownshoes at SAMCRO aren't an advertisement for much beyond making birth control very available and supporting your local law enforcement.NUTSHELL: A very good watch, but be sure to laugh *quietly* at any nimrods (guys or gals) you see sporting SoA merchandise (cuts, shirts, hats, etc...)...for they know not what they reveal about themselves.
'spoilers' are vague so it shouldn't ruin any surprises but there are some details revealed.I gave a 7 of 10 for its realistic, gritty portrayals and convincing acting. This show is well written and well acted. Only a little "Hollywood" phony stuff here. I originally rented it to learn what Hollywood was saying about bikers. Being a motorcycle rider myself I just had to see what was being portrayed.I like it for showing the mindset of those in outlaw biker clubs. We get an accurate look at what goes on in the club and in the heads of members.Emphasis is on "outlaw" here. There are many law abiding motorcycle clubs out there that are good for the community helping with fund raisers and other events.Maybe this series will open the eyes of those contemplating joining an outlaw M/C club. Murder, deceit, illegal activities that can bring prison time or a bullet to the head are all aspects of outlaw clubs.All the emphasis on camaraderie, 'family', and brotherhood make it seem like a good thing. Having a group of friends you can count on is good, but if they are outlaws you most likely will end up in trouble with the law sooner or later. Pay attention to how they use money to corrupt the local law.Most of them live with the motto, "Start no s**t, there will be no s**t. But that only applies if you don't annoy them first. Then there is the illegal activity that may one day spill over into your life. Selling guns illegally to other outlaws does not put them on my Christmas card list.But again the positive side of this series is that it shows quite accurately what goes on in clubs like this.FIRST EDIT: After thinking more on this series I am finding myself more intrigued wondering what the writers will do with the characters. I intend to view all of the episodes so I can better comment on series later. A guy I knew from work tells me this stuff is pretty darn accurate as to what goes on in outlaw clubs and between them. They talk very casually about wasting someone who is a danger to the club. Take note and give clubs a wide berth.To their credit outlaw clubs have a code that they stick together and woe be unto anyone who breaks that code. At least they have honor amongst themselves. One thing I like about this is that no one with any brains would be rude to these people in the SOA. They know the consequences. There are now many rude people in our society because we decent folks allow them to get away with it. We sometimes hesitate to tell off the rude ones because we fear a situation or even a law suit if things get out of hand. Every time we allow that we "enable" the rude ones to continue their behavior. This show has convinced me it is time to cease allowing rudeness.
It's a very entertaining show for what it is. I mean- who would get tired of seeing badass bikers kill and shoot at each other? The plots are bit over the top and each episode seems to try to one-up on the previous. The senseless violence can become a bit much, but I still enjoyed it.


                
I applaud Kurt Sutter for creating something wholly new and exciting, and he clearly has a love for the motorcycle culture that shows thru in every episode. Charlie Hunnam, Katie Sagal and Ron Perlman are outstanding in their roles and pretty much carry the show. It's no coincidence that when Perlman's character dies, the show was never quite the same.Now having said that, there are some flaws. As the seasons wore on the characters seemed to reached Chuck Norris levels of hand to hand combat skill, and I cringed every time Jax started a statement with "Look, man...". But all in all some pretty minor complaints for an otherwise great show.No, my biggest criticisms are in the presentation of what it means to ride a bike every day. As a member of a club who puts over 12k miles per year on my bike I can tell you some of the misses were glaringly obvious.1. I know it's California, but it never rained once in 7 years? Not once? Thug life takes on a whole new meaning when you have to spend 5 minutes gearing up before you can get on the bike.2. All the bikes are the same. Not only do they all ride Dynas, but none of them are all that customized. Not a single Heritage Softail or FatBoy in the bunch (other than Bobby's smoke belching backup bike used as comic effect). This is a California biker gang with their own garage and they all ride matte black Dynas? Sorry, not only is it unlikely from a motorcycle culture perspective, but they missed a golden opportunity to create bikes that are their own characters.Match the bike to the rider. The Mayans and the Grim Bastards did a better job of this, largely because many of them were played by actual biker gang members who brought their own bikes. The Sons' bikes smack of a production decision to use bikes that are easy to ride and to fix. Bleh,3. Nobody was ever a victim of a stupid cager. Even in a 1% gang, the biggest danger they face on a daily basis is from soccer moms in minivans who don't look before making a move. Seems this could have been the basis of an entire 3 show arc. One of the gang is senselessly killed by a douche in a Mercedes SUV and the club has to figure out whether retribution is warranted, or smart. Maybe the douche is connected politically, or something.Anywho, a really good show that I recommend. Just not great.
The first seasons I really enjoyed this show. It was refreshing, easy to watch, and the plot was interesting enough to keep you entertained. Normally I hope that good shows go on forever but with this one I was actually glad it came to an end. I mean how long can you go on being at war with every possible other gang? There was just a little bit too much betrayal for me. There is betrayal in gangs like that but not of those proportions like in the show. The characters were all OK, some were very detestable at the point you really wished they died but that's a good thing because it meant that the actor did a good job making his role believable. Some other actors were not very believable to me as bad ass bikers. To me the plot started good, then it went downwards with too much back and forth problems between the different gangs, but then the last season was back on track with a good ending. Nice show to watch once.


                
The story is one of a Shakespearean tragedy. Where the two styles differ is that SOA does not give you a lot of sympathy for what are brutish thugs with few redeeming qualities. The acting can be over the top. Still- a show that will have you coming back for more


                
I love gangster bikie type shows. I was intrigued by the idea of following a Shakespearean narrative. In saying that the series can frustrate you as it oscillates between Shakespearean and blow-you-away moments and completely lame and silly plotlines. Overall I did enjoy it however, but I can imagine this won't be for everyone.


                
I've followed this show for all its seasons and I have to admit, it's impressive. What initially appeared as a style and stereotype exercise has really turned into a good, dark show.What I appreciate is that there is really no shining angel in the show, all the characters are dark and have, over the seasons, gone down dark roads and every one of them is hard to really like. That is something different and worthwhile to me.All that said, this last season has proved the toughest to watch for one reason, Abel. He is now portrayed by what is absolutely the worst childhood actor in the history of television, and that's saying something considering i grew up in the 80's. Awful.


                
I've loved SOA from the first few shows savoring every episode as this group of characters captivated me in showing a side of life far from what I've lived. While frustrated at times at the constant barriers, it is those barriers that have made the show so intense and captivating. After the season 6 ending I am very concerned for where the story has to go now. I didn't see it coming, and while likely necessary to facilitate new paths for the story I'm not sure they will be able to pull it off. The end of season 6 leaves a future that requires radical change to some of the core characters in ways I will be amazed if it doesn't result in the show entering its demise. I pray I'm wrong as I am addicted to this show, but there are just some things that are to core to the story to eliminate without tearing apart the fabric of its success. I fear that is exactly where this is heading. I hope I am wrong. - Added 1/31/2015 - I wasn't wrong, season 7 was unbridled violence and pointless brutality. With no reason to be anything other than thug that is exactly what Jax became. When he "drove off into his sunset" riding that old Harley into the oncoming truck it was sweet release for every former fan who just couldn't stop watching. Never have I seen such a good show go so bad so fast. To sit and watch Kurt say how season 7 was a relief to create as all the complexities of prior seasons had been eliminated. Yeah, it was easier Kurt because it wasn't anywhere near as good. I would have been happier for the franchise if Season 7 wasn't created and we were left with the knowledge that everything would go to hell with Tara gone as Jax no longer had a reason to fight to be free to raise his family free from what he had been subjected to.


                
At the end of season 6, I find an increasing lack of satisfaction with the show. Many, if not all of the characters are unlikeable at best, including those of Katey Sagal, Charlie Hunnam, and Maggie Siff. In addition, the body count per season is rising significantly. So much so I start to wonder if the town of Charming can perhaps be looking somewhat deserted.Initially, the central and ancillary characters all had their merits, but as the seasons progressed, they changed, perhaps to the ultimate detriment of the show. Earlier, there were occasional bursts of black humor and the plot twists were few but served to propel the storyline and increase both tension and interest.Sadly, no more. It is becoming a relief to reach the closing credits for each episode because the morbid songs that often serve as a soundtrack to the ending scenes are just too depressing.Sutter's writing remains powerful though and the actors - lead and otherwise - give sterling performances. All seem to judge their roles perfectly and give terrific performances, though Jimmy Smits is a standout. At times and in other shows I'm acutely aware that I'm watching actors at work, but not so in SoA. They all seem authentic and for this I can mark the show higher than I otherwise would, though if I was writing this after season 3, I'd mark it much higher still.And as has become almost the norm, the season ends with an apparently impending prison term for an otherwise innocent character.So I await season 7, but with less enthusiasm than previously. I no longer have the strength of interest in the character's fortunes, and may well move on to something else come September. That said, I'm hopeful Sutter will rediscover originality and inspiration and is able to elevate SoA to the heights it once reached.
This show has has fluctuated between predictable and good but, the end of season 6 was all predictable. I'm assuming the plot twists were meant to be unforeseen but, they were not. Weather this series ends next season or not, it will be the last season I watch. Shows like Breaking Bad and Dexter ended with self respect just as they were loosing appeal. That's how all shows should end. I hope this doesn't become a show like Nikita, that keep going due to a small fan base, who love the show out of loyalty and can't accept the show has run it's course. SOA will either take that course or become a full on soap opera if it continues. I hope season will be the last so the show ends strong.


                
My wife and I were excited to watch SOA at first and the writing was good with interesting stories and insights into a lifestyle most people do not know. This in itself is a good reason to watch. The show held our interest until it started to become predictable and stopped breaking new ground. What should be a final season has been watered down to stretch into two final seasons and it really shows. There is lots of filler in every episode that would not be there if Kurt Sutter, the creator, had let it finalize in one season. Greed rears it's ugly head once again. The sign of a great story is to watch as a character grows and changes as events occur to him/her and how said character deals with these changes different from what they would have when we first met them. These characters never change. Or at least, the majority don't. Sad really, as Sutter had something here but he watered it down and lost the edge.


                
Ok so the plots can be a bit ludicrous. The acting and writing has some corny moments. The protagonist fails in my mind to redeem himself despite seeming to have redeeming qualities. But gee, it was a fun ride that was worth every moment.


                
The first four seasons of sons of anarchy are very compelling viewing, the characters are drawn by the actors with such skill and love for the material you will find yourself thinking they are real bikie gang members.Unfortunately seasons six and seven let the series down, it became too convoluted, too bloodthirsty, the characters became very unsympathetic in the viewers eyes. and the same plot device was used repeatedly to the point that I could no longer suspend my disbelief. I became frustratedly bored with season seven and in my opinion the show should have ended in the fifth season.


                
Sons Of Anarchy has one, huge problem: Charlie Hunnam's character, Jackson 'Jax' Teller.He's a whiny little sh*t.The rest of the cast are all strong, and more-or-less believable. We've got Chibbs (Tommy Flanagan, with his real Glasgow Smile), Bobby (I've met so many big ole bikers who are like him) and Juice (Theo Rossi is an underrated actor IMHO). We've got Happy, played by David Labrava who is a Hells Angel in real life as well as a bike-magazine writer.NONE of these guys would do anything, except laugh, at some piece of fairy floss like Jax trying to be 'tough'. No matter how many things they get him to do, no matter how they ratchet up the tension, I just CANNOT take him seriously.I'm not even sure it's Charlie's fault - I think it's maybe just the character. I quite liked him in Pacific Rim. But then they chose to put a fine-featured little blonde boy in the role of an MC bad-boy: it's the producers' bed and now they must lay in it.The series keeps re-using the same plot devices over and over again, but... like we care? As has been said many times, including by the cast, it leans very heavily on Shakespeare. Round and round we go, seeing how many different types of trouble we can get ourselves into, and what profound realisations we can make in the depths of despair, the heights of victory, and in the hysterically absurd.It must be noted that, as far as I can tell, no real bikies watch this show. I attended an appearance by 3 members of the cast, and, apart from the poor guys copping some of the dumbest questions anyone could ever be asked, the audience contained no low-percenters. No, it was wall to wall nerds.Who cares. It's got its faults, its gone silly and come back again a couple of times. It rocks.I'm good with that.


                
Let me preface this by saying that Sons of Anarchy is a very solid show and the acting is often impeccable. Maggie Siff, (Tara), and Katie Segal (Gemma) bring their "A" game almost every episode.However, this show relies heavily on violence and typical TV tropes. Violence is used to get a response so often that that while it is going for "shock value" its hard to be shocked when violence is the norm.Episodes regularly follow the same patterns (particularly in season premiers and finales. Music montage depicting normal activity, reintroduce us to characters, insert conflict, action and resolution, music montage. That is a pretty typical set up.While this show is solid and enjoyable, it is by no means of the quality showrunner Kurt Sutter believes it to be. He regularly goes after critics and award committees, but if one watches the dramas that show up come awards season it will come of no surprise to sees SoA left out.While nowhere near the best drama out there, Sons of Anarchy is a highly entertaining, soap opera of show that will keep you coming back episode after episode.


                
This show falls into a category I often like.We get blue-collar folks, or criminals, or otherwise non-exalted characters in a story about palace intrigue. There are struggles for power and leadership. Strategies for building the kingdom, and protecting its members from attack are a main thread.The Wire was a good example of this, too. Although The Wire also included distinctions between the cops and the drug dealers. The drug dealers led these big, Shakepearean lives of power and glory, while the cops were much smaller -- ordinary, sometimes petty men.While SOA is not nearly as complex or nuanced as The Wire, it is carefully put together show.I sometimes worry that a show like this might never find as much audience as it could. I know I was pretty sure I wouldn't have any interest in a show about a motorcycle gang.


                
Sons of Anarchy is a really good rural crime show. If you've never seen a single episode, it's basically the Sopranos with motorcycles and fewer suits - lots of backstabbing, secrets, double- and triple- crossing, and deals with the devil. It's a great show, well-acted, and I really enjoyed it all the way - until the last episode.I won't spoil it for you but it just rushes you to an extremely unsatisfying, poorly put-together ending. On the surface it feels like they wanted to "close a circle" as it were, but it feels ham-handed and I felt like it really cheapened everything that I had seen prior to it. Aside from that enormous gaffe this is a good series and is worth your time.


                
i hope i can meet the write (without i have a whip mixing with salt! very risky) and asked him a basic question! are you humiliating our mind and treating it as kids minds!) for good seek how terrible you solve some challenges faced to Jackson! you need to come up something real NOT a miracle fallen from the sky.I gave a 7 of 10 for its realistic, gritty portrayals and convincing acting. This show is medium written and well acted. Only a little "Hollywood" phony stuff here. I originally rented it to learn what Hollywood was saying about bikers. Being a motorcycle rider myself I just had to see what was being portrayed.I like it for showing the mindset of those in outlaw biker clubs.

I intend to view all of the episodes so I can better comment on series later. A guy I knew from work tells me this stuff is pretty darn accurate as to what goes on in outlaw clubs and between them. They talk very casually about wasting someone who is a danger to the club. Take note and give clubs a wide berth.To their credit outlaw clubs have a code that they stick together and woe be unto anyone who breaks that code. At least they have honor amongst themselves.

Every time we allow that we "enable" the rude ones to continue their behavior. This show has convinced me it is time to cease allowing rudeness.


                
No show has ever given me the desire to stop watching, but still watching, more than SOA. It flails on that edge between not enough strong story writing to carry and too much violence for its own good.Instead of building storyline, the viewer gets thrown into violent themes which are then explained. There is constant turmoil turning from one disaster into the next and missed chances at character building. These missed chances are where the show hurts and gathers its 7 star rating.There is so much more available from Callie's and Perlman's characters who are the deeper and more complex of the show, and so much attention given to the other character's in a one-dimensional manner, with the lack of shocking violence, the show might actually bore me.A constantly brooding Jax wife and over the top meddling mother makes for an annoying predictable show at times.A constantly vengeful and sensitive Jax drives the show one dimensional.But the turns and spins keep me coming back for more. Polk's death completely threw me. Juice still alive I just knew wouldn't happen. I was certain Kim Coates character was a goner and Opie would be around to the end.Which brings me to Coates' character. The over protective dog and woman loving psychopath does give the show a needed comedic relief at times.With that said. It's a very violent and sexually graphic show.(For TV) The violence is at the point of uncomfortable in Season 5 with a very graphic de-tonguing and jail rape scene which will probably keep the show at a 7 for me.
If u love gritty stories relatable characters and violence and can get past the cringey and outrageously crap Scandinavian sounding Irish accents, then this is the series for you. I am currently watching season two and love it. Apparently Season 3 has even more bad Irish accents in it! but i cant wait to keep watching and get through this series to find out what happens. I would highly recommend this show to any one who enjoys regular violence and is into the biker/heavy metal lifestyle. Overall this shows great and at the moment I'm just writing filler so that i can post my review I've said all i felt necessary so if you do decide to watch this go ahead and enjoy it.
