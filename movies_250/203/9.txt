Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers.


                
I just came back from the theater and to be honest I went into this movie with very low expectation! But WOW did it prove me wrong. The film left me on the edge of my seat all the time, one could argue things were slow sometimes but it only adds to the beauty of the big picture.Performance are top notch and if it was for me I would give Jackman his very deserved Oscar for this amazing performance, of course all the other performances were really great also but Hugh's stands out for me.This movie is worth your time, and I'm sure by the end of it you'll keep talking about it with your friends, for me that is a success stamp if the movie can keep my mind busy all the time.This is not your feel-good movie. This is a perfectly paced thriller which I haven't seen anything like it in a very long time. For me this was a totally new experience as I usually go for lighter movies in the cinema, but after this movie I will go out of my comfort-zone in movies more often to find masterpieces like this one.


                
Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars.


                
Why You Might Like It: I can go on and on about the good things in this film and why most viewers will enjoy it. It has an outstanding cast that play their parts well, the directing and cinematography are gripping, and the story is something to marvel. This is an excellent film that I highly recommend.Why You Might Not Like It: I don't know why anyone wouldn't enjoy the movie. It does run over 2 hours, so some movie-goers might think that is a bit too long, but I don't think this movie will lose anyone's interest.Acting/Casting: 9.5* - As mentioned, the casting and acting is outstanding. Hugh Jackman gives the best performance of his career in my opinion. Paul Dano is downright creepy and plays his part to a tee. Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and the rest of the cast do great work as well.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 8.5* - Let me just say that Denis Villeneuve has made his mark in the US after this one. The directing in this movie is gripping and pulls the viewer in from start to finish. I can't say enough about all of the small things that go into making the atmosphere in the movie amazing (the weather, the buildings, music, etc.) Plot/Characters: 8.5* - This is arguably one of the better abduction/kidnapping stories that I have seen. The plot is deep and has many layers that keep the viewer guessing all the way up until the very end. There is no doubt that the story plays a huge role in the final product that you see on the screen.Entertainment Value: 9* - It keeps you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Movies like this are why we go to the movies. Get out and see it.My Score: 9.5+8.5+8.5+9 = 35.5/4 = 8.875 Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com


                
On the Thanksgiving, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello), their teenage son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and their little daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) go to the home of their neighbors and friends Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), his wife Nancy (Viola Davis), their teenage daughter Eliza (Zoë Soul) and their little daughter Joy (Kyla-Drew Simmons) to celebrate together in a lunch party. Anna and Joy want to play on the street and Ralph stays with them. The girls play in a ROV and Ralph brings them back home. Later Anna asks her father to go to their house with Joy to seek her emergency whistle and Keller tells her to call Ralph or Eliza to go with them.Later the families realize that the girls went alone have vanished and they call the police department. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and he arrests the teenager Alex Jones (Paul Dano) that drives the trailer. Soon they learn that Alex has the IQ of a ten year-old boy and he is discharged. When he is leaving the precinct with his aunt Holly Jones (Melissa Leo), Keller presses Alex and he says to Keller that "the girls have not cried when he left them". Keller asks to keep Alex imprisoned during the investigations, but Loki cannot hold him anymore. While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong. "Prisoners" is a mesmerizing, ambiguous and gritty thriller about the kidnapping of two girls by a sick serial-killer. The plot is divided in interesting premises that raise the discussion of what is right and what is wrong when the life of your daughter is in danger. Is Keller right or wrong abducting Alex after listening to what he told him? The police work is flawed, leaving Alex without surveillance just like in the real world. This movie has magnificent cast and cinematography and the story has glimpses of the dark Franc-Dutch "Spoorloos" (1988). The open conclusion is another plus in this movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Os Suspeitos" ("The Suspects")


                
High level performances and directing this product is a result of a merger of the high levels of skill involved, brilliantly structured and put together this account of investigation and reaction is wonderful and heartbreaking in equal measure. The performances are out of this world and the climax is incredible, an all time favourite


                
The entire cast is absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. Casting was perfectly done. This is the most serious I've ever seen Hugh Jackman and he does it so incredibly well that I hade goosebumps more often than not. From the plot to the execution thereof was brilliantly done to bring us an unforgettable, thrilling masterpiece. Be warned, though, as the film is quite disturbing at times.


                
Where do I begin with this one.Since Enemy, Denis Villnuve has proven time and time again that any film with his name attached is a film worth seeing. Sharp dialogue, slow but engaging pace, and beautiful cinematography courtesy of longtime collaborator Roger Deacons all mix to form excellent and unique moviegoing experiences from every single one of his movies. Prisoners is no exception. 
While I may have had the misfortune of having to watch this movie over the course of two nights, this movie was still one of the most engaging and haunting films I've seen. Everyone involved with this movie brought fourth their A-game, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, both of whom delivered phenomenal and when needed, explosive performances. The supporting cast does an excellent job as well, especially Viola Davis and Paul Dano. 
The acting is not the only noteworthy part of Prisoners, as Deacon's unique style of camerawork lends itself masterfully to the bleak and hopeless tone, and keeps viewers engaged and attentive towards subtle details in every scene. 
I could go on and list everything I adored about this movie, but the best way to convey to you why this film is a masterpiece is for you to go and watch it yourself. 9.5/10


                
I was amazed by this movie. Characters are powerful and emotional. My favourite is Gylenghall because I never saw him in such a way - nervous but calm, devoted to his job. Of course it seems that he doesn't have any personal life, and I think it is a little minus. Like I didn't believe some of Hugh Jackman character's actions at the end of the movie. Tha'ts why I give it 9 stars. The strongest part of the movie, why I will remember it - it's story. So twisted, puzzled and provoking emotions (anger, pity, sadness...). Although this movie falls into simple category of "dissapeared children movies", it is one of the best! The story ant acting makes it so.


                
Boy, was I wrong about this movie.I thought it was, in fact, about "prisoners" in prison – maybe trying to escape and I put it off for the past 2½ years, although I did want to see it and others expressed high praise for it. I just thought it was some Shawshank Redemption film about the wrongfully accused. And I did keep thinking the dad was going to play that role in the first half to two-thirds. But, that couldn't be further from what this great movie was. It's an incredibly well-written, wonderfully acted, deep and moving thriller about two families struggling with the loss of their respective daughters. It's also a definite movie to see at bare minimum a second time.One wonderful (to start with) Thanksgiving, two neighboring families enjoy their meal together and in a blink, two of the family's daughters vanish. When one young male is accused of abducting the girls, one of the rightfully distraught fathers makes it his mission to find his the girls by making the man talk. All the while, a police detective is attempting to find them, too, but using the law and his instincts vs. the emotional father's antics. Probably the only downfall of this movie is that it's just too long. As much as I enjoyed the movie as a whole and all the interesting, sometimes shocking, sometimes very emotional scenes, it just kept going on and on. That said, I am SHOCKED this wasn't nominated for the many awards it deserved. The two leads themselves, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal alone should've nabbed some competing acting nods, not to mention, best picture and screenplay.While it's easy to compare this to the following year's Gone Girl, they're pretty separate in stories, though close to the thrill of the chase and intrigue. This one was slightly better, and it didn't have Ben Affleck, to boot. So, if you missed this one, but loved Gone Girl, you really need to see this.Actually, just see it, no matter what. It helps if you have small children as you can sympathize, but even without kids, it's still an emotional roller coaster that's great all the way to the ending.***Final thoughts: I don't know why I stayed away so long. So many recommended it to me. It was my invalid vision of what the movie's plot was and hopefully I won't let that happen again. Definitely want to see this again fairly soon.
The film is based on a disturbing topic that can affect anyone. Prisoners, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) and written by Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is a suspenseful thriller that leaves the viewer thinking this could happen to them. Prisoners follows two families and the kidnapping of their children. The film's dialogue develops each character differently, driving some mad while leaving others feeling helpless. As the story line develops it shows the range of everyone's emotions during this situation. Along with detective Loki, the two families must hold on to their sanity and their hope as all hope is constantly lost in the discovery of who has taken their children. Prisoners begins on an ordinary American Thanksgiving Day. Both families (The Dovers and the Birchs) celebrate Thanksgiving together, having a good time. While the parents are preparing dinner, the children go for a walk down the street, on this walk they stumble upon an old almost broken down looking RV. This creeps out the teenagers of the two families, who were accompanying the two younger children, they return home and have Thanksgiving dinner. Everything seems fine until the two little girls decide to go to the other family's house to look for a red whistle and do not return. Both families become immediately worried that their children are missing. The centre of attention is then brought to the RV and its driver, a 30 year old man with the IQ of a ten year old as the primary suspect for the kidnapping. Detective Loki takes charge and finds many potential suspects who all end up having connections. These connections bring together an unravelling ending leaving the viewer surprised, pleased, and leaving the theatre still thinking about the movie.The characters, and the actors who portrayed them, in Prisoners were a key element that really made this film work. Although there are many actors who brought this film together, there are really three who stood out. First, Kelly Dover (Hugh Jackman), a middle aged man with two kids and a wife. Kelly is prepared for what seems like everything, except for what happens on Thanksgiving Day. As the film develops we see the situation eat away at Kelly driving his sanity through a window as he believes his daughter should have been found by now. Leaving him looking more like a suspect than others.Secondly, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), a never quit detective who has solved every case he has been involved in to date. Detective Loki's name and character in general come from Greek mythology where Loki is a Greek God. One of the myths associated with Loki is that he saved children after other Gods had given up, this is the basis of detective Loki's character as he doesn't give up to find the children. This no quit attitude satisfies the viewers, because we know there is hope, and that they will be found. I admired how Aaron also pays homage to this God during a scene with snakes. There is a myth that the God Loki is terrified of snakes after an event was performed by his mother as a child involving snakes. Loki's background is never truly developed, this works, as it leaves the viewers focusing on urgency of the present situation. However, there are some hints that his background involves some abuse due to the fact that he is so involved in this case. Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is the character who takes this film to the next level. Alex is portrayed as an adult with the IQ of a ten year old as he has suffered from an unexplained accident that occurred during his childhood. At the beginning of the film Alex is that character that the viewers want to hate on, we want him to be the prime suspect. He is that creepy, almost disturbing looking character. He occasionally mutters some words to Kelly like "They cried after I left them", which throws Kelly into his barbaric state, thinking Alex is the one responsible. As the film develops and we see Kelly take his anger out on Alex, we almost feel sorry for Alex as he begins to look innocent. Dano portrays his character so well that Alex ends up becoming a victim. The collaboration between the cinematographer (Roger Deakins) and the editing team was performed very well throughout out the film. The location of the scenes were pointed out very clearly as to not confuse the viewer and take them away from what they should be really focusing on. I absolutely loved the turning point in this film solely based on the editing and that its shots were action focused. The editors created this sense of urgency through quick cuts from Loki to the victim, to what Loki was driving through, and how we see the image begin to blur during Loki's point of view. Bringing a sense of realism to what the situation was evolving to. There was also some pretty neat shots were we see Loki driving like a maniac threw traffic. Even thought Prisoners follows a disturbing topic, it is a must see. From the moment we are persuaded it is Alex who is responsible for this heinous crime, to the side trail Loki finds that connects everything to the final unravelling, the viewer is kept on the edge of their seat, waiting for what is going to happen next. Every aspect of this film just clicked. This includes the amazing actors who brought their characters to life, the wonderful setting that set the tone for the film. I also really enjoyed the cinematographers' and editors' work and how they added so much suspense to the film. The audio was also a bonus that helped set the tone to this amazing film. In the end it was the screenplay written by Aaron Guzikowski that truly set this film apart from the rest.
Buckle up and hang on tight as this movie make you feel as if you are on the roller coaster of emotions along with the families--and the cop--in this movie. Starting slowly, but not too slow, this story sucks us in and weaves a very believable but every-parent's-nightmare scenario. Plot twists and turns keep you guessing as you become drawn to and/or repulsed by the characters in the movie, and how their lives and personalities evolve over the course of a week. Excellent performances by all.My only (slight) criticism is that I would have liked to see the older siblings' characters developed more deeply, but that does not take away from the film at all.DO NOT read anything with "spoilers" or discuss the movie with anyone unless you have ALL seen it.


                
I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this taut, this edge or your seat, and just a plain old riveting. First let's look at the actors Jackman gives a career performance, I've gotten so used to him as Wolverine I had almost forgotten this guy is an outstanding actor. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives a wonderful performance as the detective. A very small role for both actress' (Belo and Davis) but they both give nice performances when they are on screen.What I really loved about this movie was it didn't try and beat you over the head with the plot and turns, it assumed that the audience weren't a bunch of drooling idiots. It points you subtly in the right direction and lets you figure out the rest on your own. I will credit the director for this.The characters are so well written and well acted, each of them are three dimensional, and they will keep you guessing throughout the entire film as to who the bad guys and the good guys are.All I can say to you the potential viewer is get this movie, get a big thing of popcorn and extra large drink because you are NOT going to want miss a minute of this movie, in fact you really don't want to pause it either.


                
153 minutes. That's a long movie with not a lot of music in it. But when you pass the 20 minute mark you'll find yourself not noticing that and sitting on the edge of your seat for the rest 133. I won't waste your time telling you about how brilliant the soon-to-be Oscar nominees and winners were, acting was superb. With a cast like this I take it for granted. The director should get some praises, please endorse him. So, about the movie: this in-the-beginning-slow-paced drama pretty quickly turns into a nightmare and the director manages to keep up the pace till the very end. I just wish he cut the cord at the very first whistle.
Prisoners is a film that will haunt me for a while. The story is so well constructed in not your A-Z form. There's a very realistic approach to it's unhurried plot, and how it quickly unfolds in the helplessness of the two dads, friends whose little girls have been snatched, supposedly by a faceless guy, couple, loitering around the area in an suspicious RV, in the cold frosty air. This is one of many films built around the child napping scenario, the disturbing type ones, that have run more common thing in the last couple of years (Taken, The Flock) this one never more effective, though these aren't teenagers, they're kids. Prisoners works, not just because of the A level performances, some so bloody convincing, but the realistic standpoint of the characters in how they deal with the situations. We so much feel helplessness with the driven father Jackson, who resorts to kidnapping and torturing a mum, childlike suspect, you want him so much to talk, where at one point, you realize it's gonna be like getting blood out of a stone, the girl's fates, waning, or may'be already determined. Jackson does get bloody here, mind you, while his mate, not an advocate, is reversely the opposite. "Christ, your little girl's been snatched man", but the reverse contrast in these two characters works. At one point, as Jackman's "Where's my daughter", reaches a shouting pinnacle, this just reminds us of what a great dramatic actor he is. But Gylenhall, is just fantastic, as the driven cop, carving another notch under his acting belt. He brings some truly unnerving moments to his character, that you don't when he'll pop his top next. There are some sick themes to the film too, (the snakes in those containers) in a film that touches on a disturbing subject. Playing out to nearly two and a half hours, Prisoners is a rewarding experience to the movie goer, though on the other hand, you may have to allow the effect and memory of this movie to dissipate days after the view. Just cautioning some here.


                
Wow, this movie was so much better than I anticipated. Hugh Jackman showcases a really diverse range of talent in this film - there is no dancing, singing, period costumes or mutations, just raw emotion. And he delivers a really powerful performance that will leave you reeling. The story is a very compelling mystery thriller and well worth your time to check it out. I would watch it again.


                
Yes, go watch this movie, it is awesome. It is intensive, the realistic plot and the open ending, and good acting and great directing, the fine plot- twisting and crime layout and plotting, I nearly had enough of this movie let alone the open ending ! Man I want more ! Go watch this movie with your friends, it is worth your time and money !


                
In this Denis Viellenueve movie, we see Hugh Jackman playing a man in crisis to which his children has been kidnapped. Throughout the film, to get to know the character of Detective Loki (brilliantly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal) who helps Jackman find the kidnapper and send him to prison. The film shows you the events that happened on Hugh Jackman trying to find his children's kidnappers, and torture them to the holt until they give him the information that he wants. The film is very tense and gritty throughout, and the whole cast does brilliantly throughout the entirety of the film. This is the film that got me to notice Gyllenhaals power in Acting and dedication to his roles, it made me become a real fan of his work, and inspired me to watch him in 'Nightcrawler, Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, and recently Southpaw) Gyllenhaal is a marvellous Actor with a lot to offer on screen, and his Co-Starr (Hugh Jackman) does perfectly as the devastated father in this movie. You can't help think of Jackman and think (Wolverine) from X-Men. But this film proves that he is capable of being a lot more than a hard headed mutant when it comes to Acting. This film is extremely enjoyable throughout, and definitely sticks with you after watching it.


                
I love movies and I love the mystery movies the most and sorry to blow my own trumpet, I have seen a lot of them.Prisoners is one of the best mystery movies with a gripping plot. The performance delivered by Jake and Hugh are simply amazing. You feel the characters and play them. While Hugh Jackman is on screen, you feel his pain of father searching for daughter and while Jake Gyllenhaal plays detective, you feel like a true detective. The movie keeps you engaged in solving the mystery. The ending is completely satisfying and everything, though appears to be so enigmatic all the time, makes sense.This is a masterpiece and a must watch for all the movie fans.


                
What makes Prisoners so special, is that it is more than just one of the most tense thrillers ever seen, classified into the ranks of thriller-titans, like "Seven": It raises questions, builds up labyrinths and puzzles, twists the plot countless times and leaves space to interpret. You must watch out, be attentive and curious in order to find out everything, and even then you have to watch the film twice if not more times. Rounded by a genius-like actresses performance of Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano and especially Jake Gyllenhaal playing the detective Loki. How would I have reacted in cases like this? What means this? Finished with a great ending, Prisoners is a must-see for every fan of thrillers or just movies better than the rest.


                
"Prisoners" is a searing film that takes a scenario we've seen many times before and stands it on its head. The film is about the abduction of two young girls and the way it effects their families and the police who search for them. It has a circular maze as one of its central motifs, and also has a maze of a plot. As Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the distraught father of one of the girls takes the law into his own hands and remorselessly pursues one of the suspects, he becomes at odds with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who hunts down other leads.Both men work through the maze of clues from opposite directions with pieces of the puzzle slowly dropping into place. Finally it all comes together in a disturbing climax. When a thriller this good comes along, we tend to start making comparisons with the greats of the genre, Hitchcock and Polanski or more recently Demme and Fincher, but if this movie reminds me of anything it's the Dutch version of George Sluizer's "The Vanishing". Not so much in superficial similarities, but because both films share a quality that was perfectly summed up by British actor Brian Cox – desolation. Although Cox was talking about Woody Allen's "Match Point", it's the lack of comfortable closure that generates that feeling, and all three films have it. With that said however, French Canadian filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve, is a man who rejects categorising. "I'm not necessarily a thriller fan", he says, "I didn't want to make a thriller; I'm not so attracted to genre. I thought the thriller elements inside the movie were just a vehicle for something more interesting: the dramatic and moral aspects of the story".Although we expect Jake Gyllenhaal to stretch himself in every role; it is Hugh Jackman who really challenges himself here. As Villeneuve said of him, "Good actors reach a point in their career where they just have an urge, an artistic need to explore new territory; they don't want to be prisoners of their own image and Hugh chose 'Prisoners' to move outside his comfort zone". Jackman nails the part of the self-made, self-reliant man who refuses to simply accept things as they stand.Despite improvisation on the set by Villeneuve and the cast, much of the credit for the film's power must go to the script by Aaron Guzilowski.When Villeneuve was given a choice of scripts after receiving serious Hollywood attention following the release of "Polytechnique", he chose Guzilowski's script. There are no red herrings in the story; everything in "Prisoners" has meaning and fits into the maze. It's such a cleverly thought out plot, brought to life on the screen by Villeneuve and his crew plus a perfect cast. Although Villeneuve says he doesn't want to be pigeonholed in the thriller genre, lets hope he makes a few more visits before he hangs up the megaphone and folds the canvas chair.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningKeller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are plunged in to every parent's worst nightmare when their daughter goes missing, along with the daughter of their close friends Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis.) The finger of suspicion ends up pointing at Alex (Paul Dano), a local impaired boy, but due to a lack of evidence, Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the detective in charge of the investigation, is forced to let him go, much to Keller's chagrin. He takes the law in to his own hands in a desperate bid to find out where his daughter is, but nothing is quite as it seems and the real reason behind the girl's disappearance may be deeper buried than they thought.Sometimes, a simple, straight-forward story can work on far more levels and have a lot more to it if there are some strong human dynamics behind the scenes of it, i.e. in this case the ultimate nightmare of any parent, the loss of a child. Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners sets itself on a much grander scale than your average staple thriller, driven as it is by a strong sense of dark, forbidding atmosphere and stark exploration of human emotions and dynamics. In short, it has a lot more going for it than your typical thriller of it's ilk, filling every second of it's two and a half hour running time with hidden depths that just keep on coming, even if at times it all just does feel a little over whelming.While it's cascading down this emotional roller coaster ride, it's careful never to forget or unduly expose the mystery element to the story, keeping up the suspense over the missing girls and who or even what could be behind their disappearance. For material of this length, strong performances are a no brainer, and indeed we have revelatory turns from lead stars Gyllenhaal, turning in maybe his most intense, driven performance yet as the detective under pressure from others that never lets up, driven mad by constant potential break-throughs that lead nowhere, but it's Jackman as the tormented parent who possibly makes the biggest impression, channeling his Wolverine anger into something that will gain him more appreciation with a different audience.In aiming that bit higher than your typical thriller fare, Prisoners may be a bit too much for some to take in, and occasionally it is a little pretentious and see-through in trying to be deep, but it is no less of an accomplished effort that succeeds in what it sets out to do. ****

The review: Wow. Difficult to unpack such an emotionally riveting, suspenseful movie that has you on the edge of your seat most of the time. The fall movie season is officially underway, and couldn't be more welcome. After a disappointing summer movie season for the most part, it is easy to tell based on the previews alone before the film that the next few months will bring no lack of great movies. Okay, back to this one. I have been looking forward to this one for a while. Not that I enjoy the situation the main characters will be put into, probably more because it is at times thought provoking to think about what would you do if you were put into a situation, or a revenge or vigilante situation in which you felt the law failed you.The previews for this movie did a great job, because ¾ through this movie, I still had no idea what was going to happen or who the abductor of the children was. The director does such a great job with building the mystery and the revelations and foreshadowing that it's just not possible to figure it out. There are clues of course but to figure the whole puzzle out, well, it's pretty impossible, and that's part of the reason this movie is so great. It is definitely emotionally taxing. My wife did not want to watch the movie, and with good reason. In the film "Ransom" Mel Gibson is on a manhunt for his child's kidnappers and is in communication with them. The audience also gets glimpses of the child occasionally and knows that while not in an ideal situation, he is okay. In this movie, the audience does not get many revelations. The children are gone, and that's all we know. We don't know how, who, why, or where. It's difficult to explain much more without giving anything way, and I'm not going to do that. While this movie is NOT a feel good movie or a pick me up, it is superb, and for the most part, with the emotional trip.
Whenever you can set aside a few hours for this thing, go and see it. Just be prepared for it: this ain't a movie you can just casually watch.
