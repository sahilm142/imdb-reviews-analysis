British Army Colonel, captured along with his regimen by the Japanese on the island of Burma in 1943, refuses to abandon the rules of his government and build a railroad bridge across the Kwai river according to the plans of his mercurial Japanese counterpart, Colonel Saito. Saito, under orders from his superiors to have the bridge completed by a certain date, eventually yields to the Britisher's demands and construction gets under way, but a POW escapee from the American Navy has been recruited by British officials in nearby Ceylon to return to Burma and blow the bridge up. Complex clash of personalities, with Best Actor Oscar Winner Alec Guinness nimbly helping us to understand his character's motivations (he not only engineers the building of the bridge to aid the enemy, but helps construct a masterpiece--while underlings wonder if perhaps a temporary structure might have sufficed). To be engrossed by this Best Picture Academy Award winner is to eventually sympathize with Guinness' Colonel Nicholson, who figures it's better to build something worthwhile and long-lasting (even as a prisoner) than to do a sloppy job. David Lean (winner for Best Director) does some of his liveliest work behind the camera; opening the film carefully, like a good novel, he lays all these difficult, stubborn warriors on the table and allows us to get close to each one. That said, the big climactic finish--while suspenseful--is ultimately a let-down. Lean's staging is sufficient...perhaps the editing is at fault? Throwing out the people we've come to know so intimately for the sake of rousing visual action leaves a sour taste behind. Yes, it is the madness of war to finish with no winners, only losers; however, the way it plays out here feels half-hearted, and a line of dialogue from Jack Hawkins' Major Warden adds a curious layer of dissatisfaction and confusion. Pierre Boulle was also awarded an Oscar for adapting his own novel (he was fronting for blacklisted screenwriters Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson); Jack Hildyard won for his cinematography, Malcolm Arnold for his commanding music, and Peter Taylor for his (rather spotty) editing. *** from ****


                
When this film appeared, in 1957, it naturally garnered many an award and much personal acclaim for director David Lean. The story itself, originally written by none other than noted French writer Pierre Boulle, who wrote the book, Planet of the Apes, was pleased with the finished project. The story is very loosely based on the actual construction endeavor, called building the Kwai bridge, is herein incorporated to include the British prisoner of war camp, run by the Japanese during World War Two. A culturally traditional, hard-nose commandant, one Col. Saito (internationally acclaimed Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa) has been given the task of constructing a railroad bridge over the river Kwai and is further ordered to have it completed by a given date. Failure is not an option. To his camp arrives an equally stubborn and somewhat arrogant British officer, one Col. Nicholson, (Alec Guinness) with several hundred POW soldiers. Already in the camp is a small detachment of American and allied soldiers who have been assailed and threatened to build the bridge. Among them is, Commander Shears (William Holden) an American POW who manages to escape the hell hole and makes it safely to a British base. Though Saito and Nicholson begin a battle of wits as to who is in command of the camp and its men, Shears is confronted by another British officer, Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkings) who asks him to return to the site of the bridge, to help him blow it up! James Donald plays Maj. Clipton, a British medical officer who watches as the various conflicting officers strive to give logic to insane goals. Every audience who views this movie, has to decided for themselves who among the officers, makes any sense to a mad-cap project. The film should be a testament to the insanity of every war. ****


                
I saw The Bridge on the River Kwai on cable yesterday, and liked it so much that I watched it again a few hours later. However, it was by no means infallible, and had themes, characters and sections which simply did not work. Holden's portrayal was ridiculous- surely inspired by the films financiers who wanted to portray Americans as inexplicably 'cooler' and more easy-going than others. What possible other reason could there be for him receiving top billing over the great Alec Guinness (who's performance as the flawed Nicholson was one of the best performances in cinematic history).


                
Before I write IMDb reviews, I try to do as much research about the subject film as time allows. As part of my research, I always read a sampling of other user reviews in order to taste the prevailing sentiment of the film, pro, con, and indifferent. Many of the most negative reviews about this film object to the alleged falsification of history by the creators. Although I was disappointed with this latest viewing of the movie, I don't agree with these reviewers. The film is a work of fiction that is loosely based on a true, historical event, and that is how it is to be viewed. I recently watched "The Best Years of Our Lives", another film, much more to my liking, that is also centered on World War II but focused on an entirely different aspect of that war, the daunting adjustment of combat veterans to a civilian life back home in a world that was supposed to be peaceful but wasn't. As in the case of this film, that product was a work of fiction based on true experience, but neither film was intended to be a factual account of non-fiction. The actual combat disability of actor Harold Russell in "Best Years of Our Lives" is very real, but he doesn't portray himself or his own, personal story in the movie. In this case, no one is denying that Allied prisoners were treated much more harshly by their Japanese captors than depicted here or implying that the real colonel, upon whom the story is based, collaborated with the enemy as the fictional Colonel Nicholson did.My own problem with this film is that it opens with a very dramatic battle of wills between Colonel Saito and Lt. Colonel Nicholson and ends with an even more spectacular finale, but I found very little action in between. While the scenery of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) was quite spectacular, much of the dialogue was dull and even banal. Although the Siamese (Thai) women were very pleasant to behold, but there seemed to be a huge gap between the engrossing beginning and the sensational ending.Alec Guiness, who was very reluctant to take the role of Nicholson, created an intriguing portrayal of the officer in charge of the Allied prisoners. Sessue Hayakawa was equally as good as his counterpart, the Japanese officer in charge of the prison camp. Many notable actors, including Charles Laughton, refused the role of Nicholson because they didn't understand his motivation, a view which should be appreciated. Others believed the material, based on a French author, to be viciously anti-British, which is also a reasonable interpretation. I was unimpressed by the rest of the cast, and I consider myself generally to be a fan of William Holden. His exchange with the bribed Japanese guard was nothing short of ridiculous. I was actually embarrassed for poor Bill, who didn't seem to be emotionally involved in the lame dialogue.As a result of the commendable performances of both Guinness and Hayakawa, the beautiful cinematography by Jack Hildyard, the film's trademark whistling of "Colonel Bogey's March", and an unforgettable ending that was worth the long wait, I rated it a 7 out of 10. I strongly disagree that fighting the Japanese and the Germans in the most effective way possible during World War II amounted to "madness" as this film seemed to suggest at the end. That is just wrong.
This large-scale and realistic film was just a decade after the World War II had ended, without much technology assisting in creating credible atmosphere and effects. Even colour films were not so common... As the Brits had maintained more or less normal relations with their former colony Ceylon, they were able to film there, using lots of mass scenes and manual labour.The idea behind is intriguing, and after a certain escape, the film consists of two parallel set of events intertwined in the end. However, many scenes are depicted too lengthily, bringing along temporary uneven pace and and diminishing excitement (or current viewers have just become too impatient...) As for the cast, only Alec Guinness as Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito were catchy to me, I can't remember the others from other films, for example. Well, Guinness was awarded his only Oscar for the role (great, but lengthwise not a real leading one)... All in all, the film received 7 Academy Awards, showing that the opportunities of that period were used in a maximum way. I could particularly point out the directing and the music, with many songs becoming hits afterwards. A real pleasant supporting actor is the nature, forming a contrast to construction activities and prison camps (however, life of Japanese POWs was not as harsh as of German or Soviet ones).Thus, The Bridge on the River Kwai is undoubtedly a great war film, but I am not sure it "accosts" modern viewers with Oliver Stone, Brian de Palma and Clint Eastwood in mind...


                
The Bridge on the River Kwai is a World War II film. One of those big movie war epics. But epic though it may be this film is not about the massive global conflict. This is a small story, a story really of two men and their war of wills. The fact that these two men are each in their own way quite mad makes for a fascinating story. It's a story with great moments of triumph and bitter moments of despair. It's a story of great bravery in the face of unspeakable brutality. But really, at its heart, it's a story of madness.The story unfolds in a Japanese prison camp in the jungles of Thailand. A large unit of British prisoners proudly and defiantly whistle a famous march as they are brought into the camp. They have no idea what they're in for. Perhaps some of them noticed the graves being dug as they were marched in. That should serve as a hint. This camp is an impossibly terrible place, led by a brutal, seemingly sadistic man in the camp commandant Colonel Saito. The strong-willed Saito will meet his match in the British commanding officer Colonel Nicholson, a man who lives by rules and stands on principle. But Nicholson will immediately find that in this camp there are no rules and there certainly don't seem to be much in the way of principles either. Saito has a job for his new British prisoners. They are to build a bridge over the River Kwai. And the British officers will be forced to perform manual labor alongside their men. Nicholson cannot abide the officers being put to work, it's against the rules. Where does standing up for the rules get Nicholson? Locked inside a small iron box that's where.And so the war of wills begins. Saito has a bridge to be built and he has a deadline. He will complete this bridge by any means necessary because if he fails he will have no choice but to kill himself. Madness. Meanwhile Nicholson stands on principle which only leads to torture and a seemingly inevitable death for himself and his officers. Madness. From a certain perspective it can be said that Nicholson shows great bravery. But to what end? In playing this brave, principled, somewhat deranged man Alec Guinness turns in an astonishing performance. There is little doubt Guinness is the best thing the film has to offer. And he has a worthy foil in Sessue Hayakawa who plays Saito. Two great actors portraying two stubborn men who are too set in their ways to change. And their stubbornness can only have dire consequences.The story of the camp and the building of the bridge is fascinating, dramatic and highly charged. Unfortunately there is a parallel storyline which does not work nearly as well. William Holden plays Shears, an American who escapes from the camp early on in the film. As he recovers he clearly enjoys his newfound freedom as he waits to be shipped back home. He's living the good life, including partaking in a romantic dalliance which seems to serve no purpose other than to shoehorn a female character into the film someplace. But Shears, much to his consternation, finds that he's not going home. He's going back to the prison camp along with a team of British commandos who are going to blow up the bridge.Holden's performance is perfectly fine, as are those of the other actors in this section of the film, but the story of the attempt to blow up the bridge doesn't engage the way the story of the bridge's building does. Time spent away from Nicholson and Saito, Guinness and Hayakawa, is for this movie time not well spent. By this point in the movie we're utterly fascinated with Nicholson and the rather bizarre pride he takes in his men's efforts to build the bridge. His bridge. It's not Saito's bridge anymore which causes the Japanese commander no small sense of shame. The story of Nicholson and Saito, Nicholson mostly, is incredibly compelling. And Guinness is so perfect in his portrayal of this brave but mad man that you really miss his presence when the film veers away from its main storyline to follow the trek of the commando team through the jungle. But at least you know something quite spectacular is bound to occur when the two threads of the plot come together. Madness indeed.


                
The unusual setting, conflict of wills, and memorable characters make "The Bridge on the River Kwai" a worthwhile and engrossing drama despite some shortcomings. It would be hard to top the performances by Alec Guinness and William Holden, as two of the three main characters. (Sessue Hayakawa also has a couple of good scenes, although much of the time he is saddled with an unrewarding and rather thankless role.) Their portrayals and David Lean's direction make the movie work on a level far above the quality of the story itself. The story's historical distortions and implausible turns, which would have been fatal in a production of lesser quality, are concealed most of the time by the high quality of the other elements of the film.Besides the good work by the cast, the remote setting and the tense story make all of it but a handful of slower stretches intriguing and satisfying. There is so much quality here that it seems a bit unfortunate that the story could not have been more true to the historical setting, rather than relying so much on developments and motivations that, while dramatically effective, are historically doubtful. There are also some implausible stretches that, though carried off well enough by the cast, were not really necessary. While most viewers probably won't mind them anyway, both of these are a little too plain to avoid being noticed.As a movie, though, this is an absorbing story with strong production values and some fine scenes, and it is certainly well worth seeing.


                
*Possible Spoilers*David Lean's epic about the British soldiers and officers captured by the Japanese who, in the name of pride and what could be construed as arrogance, build a bridge at the behest of the enemy is not only a great military film, but is a psychological study in the behaviors and motivations of men as well.  Alec Guinness is Col. Nicholson, a man who lets his pride and his allegiance to the rules of war nearly kills him due to his refusal to participate in the building of this bridge.  When he finally `gets his way' however, he takes on the project with full steam and craftsmanship. Unfortunately, the British Army is scheduling the destruction of this bridge because it will assist the Japanese in its occupation of India, something that Guinness realizes too late and with great consequence.  This is a long film, and probably could have been trimmed just a bit, but there is very little to complain about.  It is an epic in every sense of the word, and the rich character studies are just one of the elements that make this a quintessential Lean film.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is not a typical military film, but is a fantastic addition to the genre.--Shelly
In the Golden Age of cinema, David Lean was dubbed as the king of epics. One of his more high-prolific entries into that category was the 1957 classic "The Bridge on the River Kwai". To me the top priority of this movie wasn't emphasized on World War II. The film centres around a strict, but well-defined British officer Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness), a lesser disciplined American soldier Commander Shears (William Holden) and a tyrant prison officer Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) who were placed in a Japanese prison camp where they were forced into labour to build the railway bridge over the River Kwai that connects from Bangkok and Rangoon. While this is done these three individuals try everything to co-exist with one another. You see very little of the war. The abysmal conditions of the prison camp is hard to swallow and cruelty that comes with the package is not for the faint of heart. This is where the best scenes take place, especially those who are into character-driven movies. This is where the performers truly exhibit themselves so that they can get Oscar recognition. And the harsher the conditions the better. Like a blessing in disguise for the viewers. It's quite astounding that the characters come to life as we are invested in the main three characters (and a few supporting ones) become more fascinating as they develop. I was very pleased that Hayakawa was made into a great character, a lesser made film would've dismissed him into a one dimensional cartoon like villain. Lt. Col. Nicholson is a dedicated officer who's by the book persona gives him that edge of a true leader in his world. He will not budge unless Saito shows more respect towards the Geneva convention in which officers are forbidden to manual labour, in spite of his orders that prisoners in spite of their rank must build this bridge. But when Saito takes the request into consideration or else face ritual suicide, Nicholson goes through great lengths to humiliate the Japanese by upstaging and promoting how great the British Army is buy building a better bridgeIn spite of how proud and dedicated he is towards the British Army, Nicholson is far from perfect, in fact his flaws are quite obvious. His role becomes that of the tragic hero in which even the good guys can get their comeuppance. His character blunder comes from the issue he was fighting against ends up taking over his life as his building of the monument becomes all that matters to him and what the purpose at to why this bridge is being constructed."Bridge on the River Kwai" works on various levels in terms of great pace, remarkable characters and well put together plot, there is still a major flaw that holds this movie to being a masterpiece. While doing everything in its power to make this war film not emphasizing too much on the war, the last fifteen minutes ends up becoming all about the war and the preachy cliches there are about how bad war is. If they would've kept up with the human drama, this movie could've been pure gold, not that is was overrated. The political sentiments just takes over in the end and when the final quote, "Madness, Madness" comes around after all the chaos has happened, it leaves a sout taste in your mouth.Many reviewers have said that this movie has anti-war written all over the script and that the after effects of the war can cause even the sanest individual traumatized. No disrespect to the reviewers, but that is not the case. Up until the last 15 minutes it was all about men going out of their ways fighting through hard times during very complicated times. The war was used as a decoy to represent the setting of this film. and even if this film has the anti-war theme stamped all over, they should have kept it more hidden than blurted out in the end which was a cop-out to a potentially reasonable ending.Sure I may be fixated on this flaw too much, but it's because I cared so much bout the movie and director David Lean got lazy and just rushed off the ending too fast making the ending way too inorganic. In spite of this flaw, "The Bridge on the River Kwai" is a remarkable movie to enjoy and it still holds well as one of the best classic epic films with a great cinematic achievement in character driven movies.
The Bridge on the River Kwai is an excellent movie and definitely one of the best of it's time. Yes, it's another world war 2 story, however, it's completely different from all the rest and shows us some of the events that took place elsewhere during this time of war.As many of you probably know, this movie is based on real life events. In many ways, I believe that the message being portrayed throughout the film shows us the "other" harsh realities of war, not just soldiers dying in battle, but soldiers fighting to survive under harsh conditions, the pride of a captain who stands by his code, the pride of a Japanese captain and overall how both parties realise that war is what it is and we have to make the best out of each situation to survive.When I first decided to see this movie, I thought it was going to be very mediocre and plain. It was not. On several occasions they managed to keep the plot interesting and create new character developments from both the leading actors as well as the supporting actors that made the story enjoyable to watch. And on a final note, you can really tell that they tried to put a lot of detail and "special effects" into their shots which is impressive for the time.Don't miss out on this one.
There's a lot to admire about The Bridge on the River Kwai. It's a grand production put together amazingly well by David Lean & benefits greatly from his composed direction, some wonderful performances as well as its expertly executed third act. Yet when compared to its near- unanimous praise, it turned out to be slightly underwhelming experience for me.The story of The Bridge on the River Kwai is set in a Japanese prison camp during the Second World War where the newly arrived British prisoners of war are ordered to construct a railway bridge; a task which is later overseen by their senior officer after his conditions are accepted but he's completely oblivious of the allies' plan to destroy it.Directed by David Lean, this is the second film of his that I've seen, first being Lawrence of Arabia & he really seems to have a knack when it comes to handling a huge cast. Production design work is breathtaking, camera-work is controlled, editing is what I've a problem with for the film felt overlong & its finely composed score has one really catchy piece.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins & others, and their performances are very good. Holden chips in nicely & also brings along the much appreciated humour. Hawkins enters the film quite late yet leaves his mark in the end. But this is Guinness' show all the way plus there's one scene showing him walking from one place to another & the way he did it, it's a classic moment right there.On an overall scale, it's not difficult to determine why The Bridge on the River Kwai is considered a memorable classic. It's enjoyable, entertaining & even rewarding but being a long film, it also requires a bit of patience. The final act is easily one of the best ones around for it is incredibly tense, ingeniously filmed & culminates the story on a stunning high. Even though the film didn't match my expectations, I've no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. Definitely worth a shot.


                
This movie really is good. The plot is great. And the actors are great. But to be honest, for some reason this movie is not the most watchable. It is too "militant". Well it is a military movie of course, but still, it just lacks something to me. For my taste. Maybe more jokes or a playful character. Or even a bit different directing. I also miss some scenes with up-close face to face conversation with some emotions. Those are the things that raise the value of a movie. *************** SPOILERS BELOW ******************************The ending is interesting. I believe Nicholson (Alec Guinness) set off the bombs deliberately (and not by accidentally as many seem to believe, because they reason - that "he would never intentionally destroy a bridge which he had been working on for so long"). In the final scene the Colonel (=Nicholas = Alec Guinness) says "what have I done", presumably realizing he's been collaborating with the Japanese. Then he runs towards the detonator, before being mortally wounded by Warden's mortar shell. Unless he was planning the set off the bombs, he wouldn't run towards the detonator. So, right at the end he realizes , that in the big picture it doesn't matter that the Brits may got a nice recognition for building a bridge , it is much more important to serve your country, and not help your opponent. (As his medic friend tries to tell him throughout the movie)I did have some issues with this movie. But it is however undeniable that BotRK is a very good movie , especially for its time! Real rating: 7.7MY RATING SYSTEM:9.35 - 10 = rating 10 ***** 8.6 - 9.3 = rating 9 ***** 7.8 - 8.5 = rating 8 ***** 7.0 - 7.7 = rating 76.0 - 7.0 = 6 5.0 - 6.0 = 5 4.0 - 5.0 = 4 3.0 - 4.0 = 3 2.0 - 3.0 = 2 1.0 - 2.0 = 1
It doesn't take too long for the soldiers in The Bridge on the River Kwai to start whistling their famous tune. This is essentially a story about the battle of wills. There is actually four wills that come into play, the will of the demanding Japanese prison commander, the law-and-order British colonel, the rebellious American and the other law-and-order British officer/commando. The setup is that the British colonel embraces the task to build the titular bridge as a moral building task for his imprisoned troops and a way to break the will of their Japanese captors. On the other hand, the American and some British commandos vow to destroy said bridge.This film is very highly regarded by the American Film Institute, critics love it and even the masses of internet users on IMDb.com give it high regard. So I think I went into this film with higher expectations than I should have. It didn't help that director David Lean is also well known and regarded for his historical epics. I liked Lawrence of Arabia, which followed this film, so I figured I'd like this one as much.Well, I still like it. Upon reflecting on it, I like how the story takes a war situation and creates a battle of wills, rather than weapons. I also like that main conflict is not between Axis and Allies, but between two different philosophies (or, you might even say the same philosophy) between the Allies. I like the epic direction and the acting is very good. The colors and the sets, etc. are all superb as well. But, beyond being a story very well told, I can't really say that I found the piece particularly moving, intellectually, emotionally or viscerally.The story, as well plotted as it is, seems to lack the human element that gets further mined in Lawrence of Arabia. It's not very personal and although we learn bits about the characters, they are rather simple and static, which could be fatal flaws, but it doesn't convince me of anything or make me feel like I'm watching real human beings. And I suppose that's my main criticism, there is some noticeable feeling of artifice in the whole matter.But otherwise, it's a very well done work and entertaining as well. I can't love it, but I can say that it's a decent show, if you have over two and a half hours to watch it. 7/10.


                
I've seen this movie only once, and that was a long time ago. Since I was a fan of Alec Guiness, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I was not disappointed. His performance gave him the Oscar he won. He did magnificently, and I strongly recommend this movie for people who like good war movies.British World War 2 prisoners of war are given the task, by their Japanese captors, of building a railway bridge in an Asian jungle. Led by Col Nicholson, (Guiness)a British officer, the prisoners score a moral victory over the Japanese by not only building the bridge, but running the whole show. Unknown to Nicholson, an allied demolition team are planning to destroy the bridge once it's completed.A great war film. 7/10.
The Bridge on the River Kwai is a good movie but it's too damn long for it's own good. They could have cut a half hour out of this and it still would have been good enough. The acting in this movie is good too. Alec Guinness is my dawg and William Holden is a cool cat, daddy-o.
