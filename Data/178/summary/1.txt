 Comic book reality. They deserved better...

 The worst war reenactment I have ever seen

 A total disaster!

 Sweet but shallow

 one of the worst war movies that I've ever seen

 Mel Gibson Snuff Comedy/ Gore Film

 I think I'll pass.

 Cartoonish is the nicest possible way I can describe this movie.

 Save your money

 Not sure I see the difference

 The next time you try to create a captain America sequel try not to confuse it with historical wars.

 Awful, seriously awful.

 A propaganda film like an attempt to manipulating a child

 Do not praise this boring film with your shallow patriotism

 An insult to war movies

 Another Pretentious, religiously colored peace of dung from Gibson.

 I could not enjoy this movie with so many technical errors.

 Just awful . . . an insult to the intelligence

 Is it really all that different...

 Weak and pop film. Directors are getting old.
