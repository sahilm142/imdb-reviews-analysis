"Posh Spice Moves to L.A.".....or "Long Way Round" Take your pick, they're both self-indulgent crap. In this show, Ewen Mcgreggor and his rich (yet horrifyingly ugly) sidekick ride motorcycles around the world. Don't expect a travel documentary. This focuses only on Mcgreggor and his sidekick as they showcase their adolescent antics in the various countries. The scenery isn't even that great, since they went in the rainy season.It's also a product placement extravaganza. They don't ride their own bikes around the world, BMW provides the bikes and various other companies supply everything else. The pilot episode was like watching two spoiled millionaires win the lottery. I actually found myself rooting against them.
