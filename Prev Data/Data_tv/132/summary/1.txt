 No Words Can Adequately Express My Hatred For This Series

 God, how I HATE this anime with a passion!

 This overall is the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them. There are many things wrong with the series and movies.

 The self-pitying nagging never seemed to end

 Starts strange, keeps odd but attractive and finish nonsense

 couldn't watch more than 4 episodes...

 The reason I stopped watching anime

 Flat-out awful.

 through the brush stroke of the devil
