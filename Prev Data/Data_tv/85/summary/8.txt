 Beautiful To Look At, Uneven Historically

 The Crown is strangely enticing

 Epic series with depth however Prince Phillip biasedly portrayed

 From a commoner with love

 Accurate

 It's a Drama, Not a Documentary

 The Crown Jewel of TV

 Well executed royal drama. 1st season a must-see, 2nd season a bit slow paced.

 We have been much amused

 An Amazing Portrayal of the Lives of the Royals!

 Cultural

 Love History, but aren't into reading? Watch this Show

 Meticulous recreation of royals' lives behind the scenes

 Binge-able

 Very addictive

 Graceful

 After 3 episodes - disappointed

 Save Claire Foy

 Interesting

 Felt Bad For The Queen -Spolier Alert-

 Good - but glorifies the royal family too much

 Prince Philip

 Captivating and if you have no knowledge about Royal family, Just watch the show.

 "The Crown" ; lots of dramatic music involved

 Great series
