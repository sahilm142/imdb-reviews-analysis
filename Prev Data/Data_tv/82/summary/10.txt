 Amazing and hilarious satire

 Simply sublime

 Excellent

 Possibly one of the greatest pieces of television in any genre

 Mortified!!

 the office + yes minister = a slice of pure fried gold

 Pure Gold!

 Genius! Incredibly intelligent script!

 Hey, Malcolm, go die in a grease fire!

 Brilliant, and the greatest politics-centric TV series ever made

 Brilliantly muddy

 The best British political satire ever!

 The acting is great!

 The closest the 21st century has come to Shakespeare.
