PLEASE NOTE: SPOILER ALERTThe first season of this series was terrific. It really was. I loved the acting, the quirky twists used by the writers, and I was intrigued by how the characters would develop over time. Unfortunately, as the series progressed I found that the characters did not. I was so sick and tired of Nate and Brenda's on-and-off relationship which lasted the entire length of the series. So, too, did David's indecisiveness about whether or not to be with Keith in a proper relationship - and vice-versa. So, too, did Claire's never-ending quest to try and find herself. Seriously, girl, enough of the experimental drugs and bipolar boyfriends/idiot sex partners/lesbian wannabe-if-you-could-be after nearly five seasons - grow up! Even Ruth drove me crazy; I realize she was a few stairs short of the attic like everyone else in that house...but come on! Give us at least ONE stable person out of the entire ensemble. Just one, if you please?I just didn't find any of the characters likable, in particular Nate. He spent the entire time thinking only of himself and sleeping with any woman who batted an eyelash in his direction. And what was with sleeping with Maggie in the fifth season??? Seriously, cant the man keep his zipper up for more than five minutes? Why he and Brenda even bothered with each other is incomprehensible. The most ridiculous episode involving these two was their wedding day, when Brenda receives visions of Nate's dead ex wife, Lisa. You have to wonder just how tight a relationship really is when the bride is suddenly filled with doubt about her new marriage thanks to an argument with her husband's deceased ex. It could have all been nipped in the bud with tighter writing and maybe three seasons instead of five. Talk about flogging a dead horse.
Please do not consider this tv series If you don't like to see forced gay scenes and uncensored nude males at random.Watch it at your own risk.
