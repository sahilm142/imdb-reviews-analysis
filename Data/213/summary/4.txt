 Disappointment

 A movie void of any emotion

 Horrible X-Men Movie period ...

 Shallow, Tedious and Disappointing

 R ratings don't equal better movies.

 A let down

 Too long, too bland

 I like superhero movie, this was not.

 Plot holes

 Sorry guys but this was a bad ending to wolverine

 Allow me to disagree.

 I want to like this movie but I just can't

 Feminist-charged old man hero story

 Nihilistic, violent and depressing.....

 I'm sorry, but while excellent acting

 Meh

 Was I watching the same film as the Marvel fanboys

 Depression and Disappointment

 Too Self-Serious for a Wacky Comic Book Plot

 Hope is the last one

 You've seen one Wolverine movie, you've seen them all.

 This script smells like the work of some cinematography major fresh out of college

 Sad and Bleak Future for our Hero

 Put this franchise to rest

 Forced drama
