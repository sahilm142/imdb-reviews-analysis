 Much More Enthralling than that "Yo-Kai Watch" Crap...

 Attack on Titan Season 1: Lets Stop and Talk About Our Feelings.

 Overrated...

 Good start, but slowly weakens as it goes

 i got into it quite quickly

 Season 1: Unnecessary dialog causes a detachment from the series. Season 2: looking really strong

 Epic but overwrought.

 A complete outsider review of Attack on Titan

 Good but not a masterpiece, final verdict: 7/10

 Has a good start but looses itself during the progress

 A must-watch anime, flaws and all

 Heavy-handed, over the top and slow, albeit still very entertaining.

 Good, but not great

 Overrated

 An action anime that could've been a great psychological one
