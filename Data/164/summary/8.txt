 MY REVIEW: The Scary Thing!!

 Pure horror

 (John Carpenter totally hits it out of the park).

 John Carpenter's Best Film

 It's like Alien(s)..... only it's in Antarctica

 Were not getting out of here alive, and neither is that "Thing"

 The best alien of the cinema

 One of the best horror films ever made

 Awesome flick!

 A Flawed Classic

 Why is this such a dying genre of horror?

 Craft of the Carpenter.

 Dear Horror addicts, you shouldn't miss this one!

 This Monster really has the legitimation to be called a "thing".

 Extremely Gory, But Extremely Intelligent

 Great setting, fantastic effects

 One of the finest horror- scifi of all time
