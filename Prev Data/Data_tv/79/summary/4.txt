 The old west brought back to life

 TV doesn't get any better than this

 They finally got the western right!

 A Hell of a place to make your fortune...

 Very simply magnificent

 Very Good

 Rough, gritty, realistic portrayal of Western history

 Welcome to f*cking Deadwood!

 One of the best TV dramas I've ever seen

 "A hell of a place to make your fortune"

 Fantastic, take a bow!!

 HBO's Finest Hour

 Polished yet in the rough

 There's something powerful and moving about 'Deadwood'<U+0085>

 Probably one of the best written, acted, and produced shows. Ever.

 My All Time Favorite

 Stake your claim in the lawless West

 Thankfully It's By HBO

 great acting and great writing, despite the constant swearing

 Great series with two acting revelations (not who you think)

 And it started out so well ...

 HBO's Latest Masterpiece, A Down and Dirty, Brilliant and Bold Western that Will Blow You Away!

 Excellent

 Fantastic!

 Wonderful drama
