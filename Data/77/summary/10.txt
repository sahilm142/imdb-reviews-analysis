 You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize!

 Quentin Tarantino begins his directing career with the first of several chronologically mixed, disturbingly violent, and incredibly powerful films.

 A timeless classic...seriously

 Are you gonna bark all day.....

 A Neo-Violent Joy

 really a great movie!

 All of Tarantino's works are amazing and this is definitely no exception

 These 'Dogs' bark a lot, but they bite, too ...

 not just your average after-dinner movie...

 A BLOODY classic!

 Brutal and raw

 Tarantino's first & best.

 Rare Gold

 Tarantino's touch was born here!

 not all that good

 Practically tailor-made for a film buff (as well as for a viewer who watches occasionally), 'Dogs' is a picture loaded to the brim with terrific visceral energy

 The Best Film I've Ever Seen!!!

 Anything For Attention!!!

 Powerful; brilliantly written and consistently engaging, Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the greatest debuts if not overall films of all time.

 A timeless classic

 This is the classic indie film

 Classic Tarantino Crime Caper

 Nostalgic pollution

 A piece of movie history.
