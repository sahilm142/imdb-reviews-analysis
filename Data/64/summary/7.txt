 One to convert the sceptics, a rich, thoughtful and charming animation

 NOT the "Star Wars of animated features"

 A beautifully executed film from Studio Ghibli

 A fantasy fix you simply won't get any other way

 Subtle and mature in moral content. Excellent movie.

 Very entertaining and good animation but...

 Humans and Wildlife

 Jon Monsarrat review: not bad considering its anime

 Japanese Cartoon Classic

 Mononoke-hime...

 Who will save the forest??

 One of the best anime films to come to America

 Another Good Miyazaki Entry

 Very fantastic story, too dramatic for an animated movie

 Problematic Epic

 Actually pretty good

 Whats the big deal???

 :)

 some great concepts but dialog needs work

 Wow what a ride! But you have to be very patient. First half of the movie is just too complex and it isn't as good as the second!

 Blessed with a curse

 Odd and Unpredictable

 Imaginative Animation

 Brilliant, Weird
