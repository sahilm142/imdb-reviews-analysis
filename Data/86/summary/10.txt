 A Majestic Masterpiece Beyond All Other

 A film that literally excites the senses...

 The best movie of all motion picture history

 Majesty in the Desert

 Heroism brilliantly shown

 The Very Best Scene of All Time

 A True Must See

 A Vision that Defines Itself

 Why this film is brilliant, and it's not because of 70mm

 Why this classic is THE classic.

 A Movie For All Time.

 How can I fight a bloody war without artillery?

 If you can find it on the big screen - that's the way to see it!

 A sweeping epic with many layers of complexity

 Excellent movie. The lone heroic soldier unite Arab against the evil Turk

 is among the best I've ever watched !
