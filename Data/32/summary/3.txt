 Mumbling actors and extremely loud music - not a great combination.

 A cinematic mess!

 I really WANTED to like this movie

 painful and stupid

 Nolan's worst movie by far

 In Space No One Can Hear You Yawn

 The Emperor's New Clothes

 As a sci-fi fan i'm not impressed!

 Pile of Sentimaental Crap

 Astronomy and physics good – Terrible storyline – full of the black holes!

 Not what I expected......

 A movie for the Minecraft generation

 Good actors, bad movie

 The lonely cow-boy saves the world once again.

 A Film Feigning Importance

 Good cinematography, very poor plot

 boring, formulaic, annoying, uninspired

 Oh dear Nolan - too complex and improbable

 what a mess.

 Wait until Video Rental if you MUST

 An okay film at best, stunk of America been falsely humble!

 Inaudible, unclear, unwatchable.

 Awful!

 One of the worst films of 2014

 Plot holes and dead-ends, virtually no character development.
