 I truly have no idea how this show has higher than 4 stars from anyone

 OMG this sucks

 Why do people watch this?

 Why is this so popular?

 Pure amateur garbage.

 Most overrated TV show ever?

 AoT... seems good at first but is repetitive and boring as hell

 Not Completed Again

 The series starts strong transforming into a massive sloth

 Watch with Japanese Nationalism in mind

 Bad overrated anime. I can't understand how this anime is getting 10/10.

 Poorly written

 Anime sure has gone downhill, way too fast!
