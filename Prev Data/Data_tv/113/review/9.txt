I don't know if I have watched beyond first two seasons, but after reading some reviews and staying into my comfort zone I guess I won't be watching it any further. By comfort zone I mean I would try to find my answers in some other basket which does not feel so stretched.Now the positives from what I have watched.The questions that are asked you don't get a concrete answer but you get to admire across theories. For example if you ask 'Is there a creator', you can look at the entity 'Robotics and AI'.To add further, host Morgan Freeman makes this series an even better treat to treat to watch with his voice.
