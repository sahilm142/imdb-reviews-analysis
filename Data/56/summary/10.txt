 A true Hollywood horror story

 Best Performance in Film History: Gloria Swanson

 The Hollywood Myth FOREVER Shattered !!!

 They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore

 Better Late Than Never

 A very brave look at Hollywood when Hollywood was bullied by an absurd censorship.

 The perils of being a nobody (again)

 A Bitter and Tragic Masterpiece

 The seedy underside brought to life

 The dark side of Hollywood in glorious black-and-white

 "And must you chew gum?"

 Dead in street...

 Greatest star of them all?

 "I'm ready for my close-up Mr. DeMille"

 Landmark film

 "Mr. Wilder, I'm ready for my close-up"

 The Wild Roller-coaster of Fame

 Alright Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.

 Nothing Less Than Brilliant

 Superb and disturbing

 Swanson Levitates.....In A Perfect Performance

 A film that I would put in my Top 10 Best list.

 A Love Poem to the Movies

 Hollywood Gothic
