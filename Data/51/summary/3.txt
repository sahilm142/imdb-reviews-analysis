 Probably the most overrated movie of recent memory.

 Very boring movie

 Not as good as I'd hoped.

 Just a deception package!

 total confusion

 I agree with Maltin's verdict..."pretentious pap adds up to zero"...

 What the ... ????

 So boring it annoyed me

 Major disappointment

 Huh? I was truly disappointed

 Brilliant, now make me care a little please.

 Jumps around too much; too many holes in the plot

 skcuS

 Not Bad...but not OKAY either...

 What's all the hype about?

 Overrated

 Decent, not a 10 though.

 memorable, yes?

 Memento

 A BORING WASTE OF MY TIME

 MESSmento

 Incredibly innovative technique, catastrophic ending

 When trying way too hard to sound smart...

 Unlikable movie filled with unlikable characters

 twisted and zany movie!
