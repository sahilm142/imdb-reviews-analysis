I can honestly say that I haven't seen a film this bad since I sat through Planet Of the Apes(Tim Burtons). I laughed at most twice and they were strained. There were some children around me who seemed to like it, but it seemed to me like one big game of Hide and Seek. Gave it a 3 simply because kids will like it. I thought Toy Story was good(not great, not as good as Shrek for instance), but this terrible.....


                
I was truly disappointed.  I expected to find the humor that was in Shrek. I found myself looking at my watch.  My older daughter fell asleep.  The animation was great but I found the story and humor lacking. This is not one that I will purchase for video.  When I walked out of Shrek, I couldn't wait for it to come out on video.


                
I was so looking forward to seeing this movie -- even as an adult.
But it's clear that Disney no longer possesses the capability to make an animated movie for everyone a la "Little Mermaid", etc.Don't get me wrong, it has its moments, but had I been 8-yrs-old, it likely would have been much better.


                
This movie is funny, no doubt about it, but it doesn´t deserve to be in the top 250. It´s pretty much... forgettable. Mediocre. Nothing compared to Shrek, Toy Story, or Toy Story 2. The plot is extremely silly. In general, I do recommend it, but I warn you, this movie ain't that good. 7/10
