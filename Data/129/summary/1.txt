 Recycled clichés in plodding storyline.

 Devoid of grace, wit, and soul

 Harmful at best

 Depressing, nihilistic film

 NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition!

 Emperor, naked, again....can somebody please put some clothes on that man?

 I have had enough!!!

 SPOILER! Pan's Gore Fest/Over-hyped piece of bloody mess

 more cruel than enjoyable

 The wheels on the bus go....

 Portrays bad, better. A child-murder with style is "good"?

 Minority View

 For audience lazy to think, so simple and boring

 Disgusting attempt at a movie

 I waited so long to be rewarded with disappointment

 Complete disaster

 Digusting

 A gore/horror movie - not a drama

 Pseudo-indie, foreign Hollywood trash

 Love yourself and avoid this movie.

 Where is the fiction in this tale of adult violence?

 Its rubbish

 What they won't tell you, of course, is ...

 Repellant

 A fantasy? A drama? Philosophic? Cruel? Thriller? bloody?
