God! This show is hard to watch, the crude, cringe humour will have you squirming rather than laughing. The storylines are awful and the characters have less development than Bob and family from Bob's Burgers (another dreadful adult cartoon). The only saving grace of this show is Dr. Zoidberg, who made me laugh once, I think.
