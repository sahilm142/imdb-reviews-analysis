 The best story ever told on film

 Great story, wondrously told and acted

 Good , But It Is Overrated By Some

 A great film, but #2?

 Excellent Movie, But Not "Greatest of All Time."

 Emotionally Fulfilling

 If other people would rave about it less, I'd rave about it more

 A cinematic phenomenon

 Overrated and overthought

 In my top ten

 Great movie, Great Actors, Great Story

 Thought it was ovarrated, turns out it kinda was

 Mona Lisa of Film
