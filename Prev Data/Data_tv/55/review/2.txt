As much as I wanted to..I never ever got this.Tried and tried on many occasions but for me it's just not funny.I think the reason people think it's funny is A) It's got John Cleese in it and B) They cleverly stopped after 12 episodes ( thank God) to make it a "classic"!never laughed once at this...and I'm a very versed comedy watcher ..10 well better comedy shows are..Steptoe & Son.Rab C Nesbitt..Dear John..George And Mildred.Nearest And Dearest..Man About the House..Blackadder..OFAH..Open All Hours..It ain't Half Hot Mum..Hi De Hi..You Rang M'Lord..I think that's more than 10 but you get the drift.If this was made into another 12 episodes it would have become mundane and never down as a classic.Cleese was the least funny in Python ..But Python was a rip -off of spike Milligans Q series.Unfunny and childish this...wouldn't bother to be honest!!
