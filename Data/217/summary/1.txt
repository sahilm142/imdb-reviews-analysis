 THE film to challenge people's assumptions about anime.

 A Masterpiece of Animated Cinema

 The first of the 'canonical' Miyazaki films.

 The film of all times.

 If Miyazaki had made that film only, his legacy would have been the same...

 Wonderful fantasy with ecologist significance by the Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki

 The most beautiful Anime film ever made!

 One of the best films I've even seen, if not THE best
