I was channel surfing one Sat. afternoon c. 1991 when I found MST3K @the high end of the cable dial.Wasn't sure what I was seeing, & it was some time in the next half hour that I caught on to the premise: guys making fun of bad movies. The movie was unknown to me: guy crawling around a lamp cord; then motorcycles. Narrative allusions to the dialog, even older movies, & pop culture from the silhouettes @the bottom of the screen.By this time, I could barely catch my breath, I was laughing so hard. I'd later know the movie as "Sidehackers." Soon I was so desperate for this show, I'd set the VCR to record episodes while I was outta town: lesser lights like Radar Secret Service & Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.Then there were the shorts: often commercial films for industry or school. "Home Economics" & "A Date with Your Family" ("Dear, I'm moving to Fire Island"; "Emotions are for ethnic people"). If you'd seen an episode before, you laugh even harder just anticipating: from "Night of the Bloodbeast": Movie character: "We don't need to be heroes!" Tom Servo robot: "Wait a minute: who's Rose?" MST3K was truly an original show; in its last years the "host segments" got outta hand, & local cable kept changing the show times: midnight, evidently to placate people that didn't work. Episodes are available on DVD now, but I still enjoy watching my old tapes, with the commercials (remember Dennis "Woof Woof" Miller & the Acura?) & Penn Gillette announcing. The show's generally anesthetic effect was summed up by a soundbyte from "Attack of the Giant Leeches," when Yvette "Liz" Vickers is swooning in the cave: "Calgon, take me away!"
