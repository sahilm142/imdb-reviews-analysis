OMG!!! How can you even watch this crap..???..??? I'm SOOOOOOO sorry, but Dave Chapelle IS NOT FUNNY!! Is it just me or do you have to be black to understand the jokes????? I've got to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of American comedy-shows, but this has got to be rock bottom.And to say that their acting is great just shows how little you know. No one in the show is convincing (and/or funny).C'mon you guys. You need to go to Britain and get some humor-classes. Britain makes the funniest shows, always have and always will. I don't know if it's something in the water over there or if it's because they're all inbreed. Still they're some crazy funny people!! So, Chapelle Show=NOOOOOO British comedies=YEEEEEES
