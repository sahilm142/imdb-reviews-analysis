 First series good, second series terrible

 Disjoined - Hard to follow - Disappointing

 From captivating to waste-of-time

 Westworld Season 2 Awards

 Don't watch season two

 I weep for humanity...

 Waste Of Time World

 Today's lesson from the post Weinstein book of uber feminism..

 One death vignette after another with no meaning or consequence

 Can't bear it anymore (Season 2)

 Highly overrated.

 Season two is trash

 Boring....

 'Like tears in rain . . .'

 Great start! Got boring and predictable quickly

 Season 1 was brilliant, but Season 2 utter rubbish

 Westworld Season 1 very good, Season 2 a nonsensical mess.

 How could they so completely ruin this show? It has to be intentional.

 Not for me...

 Season 2 is a big letdown

 First series great, second series awful

 HBO Expects

 Season Two is terrible

 Gore violence blood even more blood and soo boring!

 Entirely unimaginative, shallow, superficial
