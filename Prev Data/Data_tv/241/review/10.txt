Let me start by saying that i've watched each episode at least 5 times,
there is an uncatchable tempo, non-stop jokes and outstanding performances from actors, the jokes are referred to both pop culture and intellectual subjects, it's partly absurd partly black comedy, and of course there is a story.
i've never enjoyed any serie as much as this one, highly recommended
