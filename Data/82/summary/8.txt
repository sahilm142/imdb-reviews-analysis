 Energetic,emotional,patriotic and a good message

 2 years later, Aamir Khan yet again succeeds with this Sports-drama. Pritam's music is a bronze medal

 MOTIVATIONAL

 Another Classic from Aamir but this time a Tribute to Mr. Phogat

 Dangal beats expectations!

 In India we celebrate the struggle and not the medals

 Dangal is Sincere in narration, Perfect in detailing, True in spirit, Patriotic and Inspiring at its core.

 With Dangal, Aamir Khan took it to another level of perfection!

 Great film, but not for the reasons you might think

 Gold

 A Powder Keg of a Monster-tainer

 Great movie !!, but with some Bollywood-ish masala.

 Charming, informing and emotional

 A must watch!

 A 2016 masterpiece.

 Screenplay and based on true story tag made it Good from ordinary story

 A very nice(fictional...I say) Bio pic I have ever seen

 Now this is the perfect example of how casting should be done. Not the best of the sports lot by all means, but certainly the way how these type of movies should be made.

 Dangal: an inspirational movie

 Dangal raises the bar so high!

 Entertains and Inspires, An Epic Movie for all Ages

 Dangal - "Dumm-Gals"

 Great a sport movie

 Great piece of work.

 A very pleasant surprise
