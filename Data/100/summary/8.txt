 A Lightweight, Clever Throwback to the Big Cons of the 1930's.

 I finally got it!

 The Big Con

 Stylish, fun but undeniably silly

 Entertaining, but Not Without Flaws

 There was a reason it won all those awards

 This is a feel-good film, which ticks all the right boxes...

 Terrific entertainment with charismatic stars and a riveting story.

 Surprisingly Wonderful and Exciting Movie!

 The greatest con film

 The quintessential con film

 a real crowd-pleaser

 The con is on! Very clever film

 One of the all-time American Classics

 Immensely elaborate, improbably effective con

 OK but

 The Greatest Film About Con Artists? Looks That Way!

 One Cool Caper

 The Sting

 I'd have liked more cheekiness and irreverence

 Another chance to see the magical pair Newman/Redford on screen again

 Crime for the Whole Family

 Nice crime-comedy stuff

 The Royal Scam

 The Con Is On Us - Universal's latest reincarnation of The Sting still lacks in Image Quality
