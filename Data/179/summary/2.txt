 What a terrible lump of trash. I am baffled by the good reviews.

 Cheap, Contrived, Exploitative

 So Disappointed

 Interestingly Stupid

 Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory

 Spoiler alert- You cannot have a terrible ending to a movie and give this more then 4 stars PERIOD!

 The movie literally mind f***ed me

 Dreadful

 I am so glad so many people disliked this!

 Artificially inflated review score by people giving this 10

 8.5...are you insane?

 The Worst Hitchock Film I've Ever Seen

 How very disappointing.

 Terrible! "Double Jeopardy" did this SOOO much better

 Initial routine plot descends to simple stupidity

 Extraordinarily poor script

 This movie is not good, like at all

 Waste of Time

 This was just so bad

 Save two hours plus of your life for something better than this

 Gone Girl: Psychopaths And Woman Beaters.

 Over-hyped and dull

 A waste of two and a half hours.

 Really??

 So disappointing
