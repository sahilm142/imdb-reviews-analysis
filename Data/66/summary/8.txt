 As good and disturbing as expected.

 Compelling yet disturbing film used as a scapegoat by media

 What would you do?

 Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Old Boys was very interesting!

 Movie & VT killer = no connection

 Octopus Sushimi - Tasty Snack or Foul Meal ?

 some like it... Oedipean

 One-Of-A-Kind Revenge Tale!

 Don't underestimate Korean films!

 Shocking! A must-see, if you have the stomach for it

 Cant really explain how I feel about this.

 An Absolute Cult Masterpiece

 Revenge can devour you and spit you out.

 Not my personal type of movie, but really good for what it is

 One of the best films I watched in 2004.

 fun, stylish action film

 Smile and the world will smile with you, cry, and you will cry alone

 A twist for the ages

 A reason to have faith in Art-house films

 different and refreshing

 very well done!

 First rate suspense; Extremely disturbing tale

 Highly recommended

 South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook directed this violent and offbeat story of punishment and vengeance.

 well, i liked it!
