There is nothing to this show. The ranting redneck Sargeant - check - the reporter from rolling stone - check - gay jokes, check, lots of talk about getting some - check. what is missing entirely is originality, any sense of reality unless reality is just boring macho banter. There is no context, no coherence and the acting is so predictable they could have just made a mash-up from other war movies and it would have been more interesting. And so far the Iraqis seem just like window dressing - something to shoot or ridicule. I guess that part is accurate in how most Americans view the citizens of the country we hella messed up.This is the most grating, cliché ridden crap that I have seen in years.
