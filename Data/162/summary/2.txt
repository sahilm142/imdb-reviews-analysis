 A thriller?

 Unbelievable plot

 Doesn't Hold Up

 Did my video chop the last 10 minutes off?

 Disappointing...

 Poorly-made fluff

 A Waste of $4.50

 Piece of Crap

 Extremely Gimmicky

 Definitely worth the money, but not the great film everybody claims

 Nice attempt, falls flat on its face.

 Not worth the price of admission

 All it has is a Great Ending

 a voice of dissent is buried here

 Totally predictable and very poor story - forget this movie!

 Talk about telegraphing a punch...

 Average film, fanatical publicity.

 Illogic and constructed

 I'm sorry but this movie was one big yawn,from start to finish

 Pretentious, Transparent, Illogical

 Most Overrated Film in the Past 25 Years!

 More boring than watching golf on television

 bardo training for the masses

 Worst movie I have ever seen

 not all that
