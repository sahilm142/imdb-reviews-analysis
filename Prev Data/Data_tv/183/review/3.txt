Mildly funny, but with a hideous laugh track. Honestly, I didn't get past the first episode, mostly due to the inappropriate cackling of the artificial audience - very bad choice. Without that it could be funny, at least if you were quite high.To the creators of this site, canceled can be spelled with two "L"s both spellings are valid.I dunno (not a real word) what dictionary you're using, but there's a problem with it.Also, apparently, I need to add more lines? Who is making these rules? If this review is rejected it's the last time I'll bother trying to contribute to this site. It's potentially worse that Wikipedia, and I didn't think it was possible to surpass that level of stupid.
