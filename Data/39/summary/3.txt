 I prefer GOOD films about the holocaust

 Vastly over-rated and highly simplistic

 Boring and missing the point

 Mixed emotions...

 Play By Memory

 What's new?

 Nothing redeeming about this drivel...

 Turn off the (Warsaw) ghetto blaster

 Unexplained cruelty, a non-character and very many fascinating wooden cupboards.

 Stupid

 not as good as i thought

 Too long - too slow
