 Pilot showed so much potential, but subsequent episodes are crap.

 Grossly over hyped

 From Wow to yewww in 3 season

 1,2,3 & Out

 More of the same

 Filled with clichés, patronizing, hypocritical, flat.

 Unable to follow through on promising pilot

 It's starting to lose me...

 Lack of ambition

 Mildly Impressive; the problem with hitting the reset button

 I just started watching this show and I am baffled at the 8.8 score

 There is an agenda and it's not telling a story

 A daydreaming nerd

 Nothing New - Stolen ideas.

 Dreadful

 Spoiler alert

 Getting Bored Episode by Episode

 Cynical, opportunist and silly - with unexpected moments of brilliance

 Addictive yet utter garbage

 Total waste of time. Shouldn't be aired.!

 Hello, friend.

 Be prepared to see penetrating male homosexual sex scenes

 No story
