 What a waste of a great season 1

 Highly overrated

 How Do You Halve Your Viewership In One Fell Swoop?

 Ambitious but rubbish

 Predictable

 First season: shite/mediocre.

 A bad mashup of Fight Club and V for Vendetta on the side of the screen.

 Terribly disappointed

 Good pilot, strong main character, get's worse along the way, partly rip-off

 Fight Club/Matrix/American Psycho Rip Off

 Pretentious rubbish

 Great start leading to disappointment

 8.6 out of 10? There are some sick people out there.

 Slow and boring

 Great cybersecurity world involving Anonymous

 Boring

 Psycodelic crap....
