The massive number of excellent reviews made me curios so I watched this movie..... And to make a very long story short: I didn't like it at all. Although it's beautifully made without question (great actors, good playing and so on) the story is somewhat plain and predictable. Many scenes are much, much too abstruse beyond any level of believability.Besides that the movie did not get me "into" it - I felt like observing the whole farce from a certain distance. I'm sorry but Personally I wouldn't recommend it.Perhaps I'll give it a second try again in the future since I do believe all the good critics have a point, too. For now I'm not able to see this point, though.


                
OK, I need to review this film on behalf of my sister and a dear friend, who saw it together, and were disappointed together, to the point that I make this movie my criterion to choose my future friends!Nothing was notable. Mediocre plot, characters didn't make sense, horrible and hilarious make up (the close ups revealed the tons of foundation used, and men's hair dye in the flash backs almost comical) among other things. I wasn't annoyed by the predictability of the film. I know that quality does not depend solely on that... But honestly, the scenes could not embrace you and make you become one with the story ... no in depth presentation... No room for my imagination, as the film is shallow and pretentious, yes, the word that describes it best is PRETENTIOUS (it pretends to be a good movie and that's very annoying because we are NOT stupid not to see it- hate films that underestimate their target audiences)! All in all... don't waste your time on this film.
