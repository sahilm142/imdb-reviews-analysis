 a lousy conclusion

 highly over-rated movie

 This movie is not fully operational... (grade: D+)

 Uhhgg!

 Disappointing Finale

 Childish

 Your powers are weak, old man.

 When the series went downhill

 I was rooting for the Evil Empire....

 Oh my god, I've gotten older!!

 Ridiculous

 Marquand Gone Too Soon

 Not A Perfect Finale But Not A Disaster Either!

 Awww, those Ewoks are adowable! Now, er, can we get back to Darth Vader, please?

 At last, they end this dumb movie series!
