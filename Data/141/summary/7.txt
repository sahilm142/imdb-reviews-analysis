 A clash of wills, principles, and egos amidst the madness of war...

 " All that effort and loss of life, madness, simply madness "

 What movie have you guys been watching?

 The Forest From the Trees

 Definitely great then, but slightly timeworn now

 Madness

 An Engrossing Drama With Memorable Characters

 An excellent military epic

 Character Film Bogged Down to Anti-War Preachiness

 A must see with an interesting plot and character development.

 Slightly Underwhelming But A Memorable Piece Of Work Nonetheless

 Good movie. For me, it just lacks strong comedic or emotional outlet.

 Superbly crafted, but...

 Pretty Good

 good but long
