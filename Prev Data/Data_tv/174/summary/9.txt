 Unexpetcted Depth

 A Surprisingly Entertaining Series

 BoJack Horseman: Fantastic

 Every episode is a truck load of emotions and you will require Therapy

 #211 in Top Rated TV shows on this site but is much better than that.

 Offbeat, adult-humored parody noir - don't lump this one in with Family Guy or American Dad!

 Gets off to a slow start, but stick with it.

 Just Brilliant

 This is incredible

 An emotional masterpiece-

 The best animated show

 Awkwardness and acceptance (very light spoilers)

 Mature Humour

 Amazing series

 The most emotionally impactful show about a cartoon horse you'll ever see

 It's good man, give it time.

 Just love it

 Unexpected mix of humour, depth, darkness and social commentary!

 A Delightful Surprise

 "Hey aren't you that horse from Horsin' Around?"

 An animated series that actually made me cry. Brilliant.

 Because sending a message is important

 Better than most

 Brilliant show!

 The tone of season 5 feels more urgent and direct
