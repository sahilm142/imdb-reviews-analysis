 A Real masterpiece

 Bergman's ultimate best

 (review of the 5-hour cut) A total, un-abashed work of art that you'll love or hate. I loved it, and it's likely one of the great epics I'll ever see

 "...Anything can happen, anything is possible. Time and space do not exist..."

 Could well lay claims to being the best European film of all time

 Triumphant

 Not only one of the best Swedish films ever made , one of the best films ever made!!!

 I'm trying to understand, but...

 Absolutely Awe-Inspiring

 Probably Bergman's best

 Life-affirming Bergman.

 Call me Ishmael

 Not obviously the work of a master

 An Ingmar Bergman Masterpiece. One of the Greatest Films Ever Made!

 Underwhelming, given its reputation

 Sumptuous production of some of Bergman's favorite themes - but far too disjointed - and where the hell is Fanny?!

 The Emporer has no clothes!

 Perhaps the Greatest Film Ever Made

 Simply Perfect Film-making

 The family through a glass darkly

 I will see this again

 A decent portrait of an era, but too slow and too long

 A great Bergman film that is unique for the director.

 Without Any Rehearsal

 Portrait of the artist as a young boy?
