 Surprisingly disappointing...

 Inept Epic

 Hollywood History

 What a pity !

 Visually stunning with a wonderful score, but deeply flawed

 "Every man dies" -- especially in Mel Gibson movies

 Brutal and Lack of Subtlety

 No, not for me

 nothing special

 Simple fable <U+0096> inaccurate and racist

 Historically wrong in too many ways

 One of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners

 More, sappy, revisionist history...

 Theycantakeourlivesbuttheycan't take our ability to bore

 I am cynical, but even I was shocked at how pathetic it was

 Historical ? Do you mean hysterical ?

 Not Even Historically Accurate...

 Did not deserve 5 Oscars

 It's no Lord of the Rings.

 Cheesy and ham-fisted

 An epic to some, boredom to me

 Waste of everything

 Don't waste your time

 The Greatest Documentary I Have Ever Seen
